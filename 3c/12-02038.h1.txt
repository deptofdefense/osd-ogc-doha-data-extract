HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) describes seven delinquent, collection, 
or charged-off debts, totaling $43,857. The majority of his SOR debts are resolved; 
however, he did not express any intention of resolving his $19,861 judgment, and he did 
not provide proof of payment of two small debts. He failed to provide sufficient 
documentation of progress resolving his financial problems. He carelessly omitted 
information from his September 29, 2011 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). Although he had 
15 traffic infractions from 2004 to 2008, in the last five years he has had only had one 
minor traffic infraction. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; however, financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 29, 2011, Applicant submitted an SF 86. (Item 5) On June 19, 
2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On July 8, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated October 16, 2013, was provided to him on November 5, 2013.1 Applicant did not 
respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 10, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s July 8, 2013 SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR 
allegations, and he provided mitigating information.3 However, he did not provide any 
documentation from creditors, disputes, or other financial documentation as part of his 
SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 33 years old, and he has worked as a network engineer for his 
current employer, a defense contractor, since April 2009.4 In 1998, he graduated from 
high school. He served on active duty in the Navy from 2000 to 2008, and he received a 
general discharge under honorable conditions because of multiple driving-related 
infractions. He has never married, and he does not have any children. He does not have 
a college degree. There is no evidence of unemployment.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports, responses to DOHA interrogatories, Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), and SOR response 
document seven delinquent, collection, or charged-off SOR debts, totaling $43,857 as 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 25, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated 
November 5, 2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt 
to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 
86 and/or his October 31, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) 
are the primary sources for the facts in the Statement of Facts. (Items 4, 6) 
 
3The source for all of the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s July 8, 2013 SOR response. 
(Item 4) 
 
4The facts in this paragraph are from Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 86. (Item 4)

follows: ¶ 1.a ($19,861) is a judgment owed to a credit union; ¶ 1.b ($242) is a medical 
debt; ¶ 1.c ($130) is a collection debt; ¶ 1.d ($46) is a utility debt; ¶ 1.e ($130) is an 
education debt; ¶ 1.f ($23,238) is owed to the same credit union as in SOR ¶ 1.a; and ¶ 
1.g ($210) is a telecommunications debt.  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for an automobile loan for about $23,000. He 
said he cosigned on a loan for a friend’s vehicle, never possessed the vehicle, and the 
vehicle was repossessed. The same creditor is listed in the SOR for both the judgment 
in ¶ 1.a ($19,861) and the unpaid debt in ¶ 1.f ($23,238). Applicant’s October 13, 2011 
credit report shows “account paid” with a zero balance owed to the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a and 1.f with a high credit of $24,785 on an auto loan. (GE 7 at 10) Applicant’s April 
26, 2013 and September 16, 2013 credit reports both show an unpaid judgment owed to 
the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.f for $19,861 and “closed or paid account/zero 
balance” for the account where $24,785 was once owed to the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
and 1.f. (GE 8 at 1, 3; GE 9 at 1, 3) Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($19,861) was 
duplicated in SOR ¶ 1.f ($23,238). (SOR response)  
 
Applicant said he paid the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($242). (SOR response)  
Applicant’s April 26, 2013 credit report lists one medical debt with an original amount of 
$194, a current amount owed of $242, and the status is unpaid. (GE 8 at 1) His 
September 16, 2013 credit report shows one medical debt, with an original amount of 
$194, a current amount owed of $65, and the status is unpaid. (GE 9 at 1) 
 
Applicant acknowledged responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($130), 
conceded it was unpaid, and promised to pay it up as soon as possible. (SOR 
response) Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($130) was a duplication of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.c. (SOR response) There is no evidence of payment. 
 
Applicant accepted responsibility for the utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($46), thought it 
might be paid, and promised to pay it. (SOR response) His April 26, 2013 and 
September 16, 2013 credit reports show this collection account and delinquent amount. 
(GE 8 at 2; GE 9 at 2) There is no evidence of payment. 
 
Applicant paid the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($210). (SOR 
response) His April 26, 2013 and September 16, 2013 credit reports do not list this 
creditor or the unpaid amount of $210 for any creditor. (GE 8; GE 9) 
 
Applicant’s May 2013 personal financial statement (PFS) indicates: his monthly 
gross salary is $6,083; his monthly net salary is $3,887; his monthly expenses are 
$2,143; his monthly debt payments are $640; and his monthly net remainder is $1,104. 
(Item 6) Applicant’s PFS did not list any payments to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
($19,861), 1.c ($130), and 1.d ($46). 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
Section 22 Police Record of Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 86 disclosed a 
driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol offense in December 2005. (SF 86 at 23, 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Item 5; October 31, 2011 OPM PSI at 2) His blood alcohol test for the December 2005 
DUI was .18. (OPM PSI at 2, Item 6)5 He said he pleaded guilty to DUI in February 
2006. He was sentenced to a $470 fine, 10 days in jail, and his driver’s license was 
restricted for one year. (OPM PSI at 2-3, Item 6) 
 
In June 2007, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication. (SOR ¶ 1.e 
response, Item 5) In December 2007, Applicant was arrested for reckless driving and 
driving with a suspended driver’s license, and he pleaded guilty to reckless driving and 
paid a $350 fine. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.c response, Item 4)  
 
Section 22 Police Record of Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 86 asked, “In 
the past (7) years have you been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in 
court in a criminal proceeding against you? (Do not include citations involving traffic 
infractions where the fine was less than $300 and did not include alcohol or drugs).” 
(Item 1) Applicant responded, “No” and did not disclose the above offense in December 
2007.  Applicant admitted the SOR allegation and said, “I did not recall the amount of 
the fine at the time.” (SOR ¶ 2.b response, Item 4) 
 
   Section 22 Police Record of Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 86 asked, “In 
the past (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal or any 
other type of law enforcement official?” (Item 1) According to Applicant’s SOR response 
Applicant answered “No” and failed to disclose that in December 2007 he was arrested 
for reckless driving and driving with a suspended license. (SOR ¶ 2.d response, Item 4)  
 
Section 22 Police Record of Applicant’s September 29, 2011 SF 86 asked, 
“Have you EVER been charged with any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?” (Item 
1) Applicant answered “No.” He explained “I completely forgot about the public 
intoxication charge.” (SOR ¶ 2.f response, Item 4)  
 
From 2004 to 2013, Applicant has been charged or cited for 16 motor vehicle 
violations. (SOR ¶ 2.g response, Item 4) Court records indicate the following offense 
information: (1) in August 2004, he received a $95 fine and $56 court costs for driving 
84 miles per hour (MPH) in a 55 MPH zone (infraction); (2)–(3) in November 2004, he 
received a $10 fine and $56 court costs for violation of a learner’s permit (infraction)  
and his offense of driving 41 MPH in a 30 MPH zone was dismissed; (4) in November 
2005, he received a $250 fine and court costs of $76 for reckless driving 
(misdemeanor); (5) in April 2006, he received a $30 fine and $56 court costs for failure 
to obey highway sign; (6) January 8, 2007 DUI, see note 6, supra; (7) in October 2007, 
he received a $30 fine and $61 costs for loud music; (8)-(9) in March 2008, he received 
a $100 fine and $66 court costs for operating a vehicle with a suspended license 
(infraction) and his driver’s or vehicle registration offense was dismissed; (10)-(12) in 
March 2008, he received a $25 fine for safety belt violation, a $50 fine and $5 court 
costs for driving on a suspended license, and a $284 fine and $66 court costs for driving 
                                            
5 Applicant’s court records show he was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) on January 8, 
2007. He was convicted of DWI on February 5, 2007, and sentenced to a $250 fine, $201 court costs, 
180 days in jail with 175 days suspended, and a restricted license for one year. (Item 11)

and (16) in January 2013, he received a $100 fine and $66 court costs for failure to 
obey traffic signal. (Item 11)      
 
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of mitigating information and explained that 
Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary 
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as 
appropriate.” (FORM at 10) He did not respond to the FORM.               
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] he is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM PSI, responses to DOHA interrogatories, and SOR response. 
Applicant’s file documents seven delinquent, collection, or charged-off debts, totaling 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
$43,857. Several debts have been delinquent for at least two years. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;6 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
                                            
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or he relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts. He did not describe any 
extraordinary circumstances that adversely affected his finances, and he did not act 
responsibly under the circumstances.    
 
Applicant said he paid the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($242). His two most recent 
credit reports show different amounts for this debt, with the most recent amount being 
only $65. The sources and responsibility for medical debts on credit reports are often 
difficult to locate and assess because their specific origin is not included in the credit 
report. Moreover, there is often a legitimate dispute with insurance companies or 
service providers over payment amounts and responsibility. Because of these factors, 
especially the fact that he has only one medical debt, I conclude the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b 
is mitigated.    
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($130) because it is a 
duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($130). He is also credited with mitigating the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.f ($23,238) because it is a duplication of the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a 
($19,861).  He receives credit for mitigating the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.g 
($210). He said he paid this debt. His April 26, 2013 and September 16, 2013 credit 
reports do not list this creditor or the amount of $210 as an unpaid debt.  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($19,861), 1.c 
($130), and 1.d ($46); however, he did not provide any proof of debt resolution for these 
three debts. He did not provide sufficient information about his finances to establish his 
inability to pay these three creditors. He did not receive financial counseling. 
 
In sum, Applicant did not provide any documentation, such as checking account 
statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or 
made any payments to any of the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($19,861), 1.c ($130), and 1.d 
($46). There is no financial documentation relating to these three SOR creditors as 
follows: maintenance of contact with creditors;7 correspondence to or from these three 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012

creditors; credible debt disputes; attempts to negotiate payment plans; or other 
evidence of progress or resolution of these three SOR debts. There is insufficient 
evidence that his financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not 
occur in the future.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
Three personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 16 are potentially 
applicable. Those three disqualifying conditions provide:   
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations,   
. . . [to] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness;8 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
                                                                                                                                            
whether he or he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
8The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
but is not limited to consideration of: .  .  . (3) a pattern of . . . rule 
violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing.  .  .  .   
 
AG ¶ 16(a) is not established. Applicant’s SOR alleges that he failed to disclose a 
$350 fine for reckless driving in December 2007 and an arrest for public intoxication in 
June 2007 on his September 29, 2011 SF 86.  Applicant admitted he did not disclose this 
information; however, his failure to disclose this information on his SF 86 was based on 
carelessness and was not a deliberate decision made with intent to conceal derogatory 
information about his worthiness to receive access to classified information. His 
carelessness on his SF 86 was based on his failure to understand the necessity or 
requirements for conscientious, thorough, and careful completion of security-related 
documentation and was not designed to conceal his reckless driving and public 
intoxication offenses. He disclosed one DUI offense on the same SF 86. His carelessness 
was demonstrated in his subsequent OPM PSI when he provided incorrect arrest and 
court dates and fine amounts for his DUI offense.   
 
Applicant’s DUI and public intoxication in 2007 and 15 additional driving infractions 
from 2004 to 2013 raise security concerns about his pattern of rule violations. AG ¶ 16(d) 
applies.  
 
AG ¶ 16(e) applies. There is substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in 
conduct which adversely affects his personal, professional, and community standing. 
Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required.    
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;   
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability. 
 
AG ¶ 17(e) mitigates the security concern raised under AG ¶ 16(e). I do not 
believe Applicant could be coerced or pressured into release of classified information by 
threats of public disclosure of his history of alcohol and traffic related offenses. Those 
offenses are matters of public record and are documented in his security file.   
 
AG ¶ 17(c) applies.  Although he had 15 traffic infractions from 2004 to 2008, in 
the last five years, he has only had one minor traffic infraction. In January 2013, he 
received a $100 fine and $66 court costs for failure to obey traffic signal. The single 
traffic offense in the last five years is minor, not recent, infrequent, and is unlikely to 
recur. It does not cast doubt on Applicant reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
Applicant has changed and matured, and I am confident he will not revert to his 
dangerous and illegal driving behavior. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is substantial at 
this time. Although Applicant has a relatively modest amount of unresolved delinquent 
debt with only three unresolved debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($19,861), 1.c ($130), and 1.d 
($46) totaling $20,037, his lack of progress addressing these three debts causes an 
unresolved security concern. His debts were discussed in detail with the OPM 
investigator on October 31, 2011. He was well aware of his financial problems. He did 
not provide correspondence written to or received from the creditors showing that he 
attempted to settle or make any payments to resolve any of these three delinquent SOR 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
debts. His PFS shows that he had a sufficient monthly remainder; nevertheless, he did 
not prove that he paid any of these three SOR debts, even though two of his SOR debts 
were less than $200. He could have made greater progress documenting resolution of 
these three delinquent, collection, or charged-off debts. His failure to provide 
documentation establishing his financial responsibility shows lack of judgment and 
raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is 
necessary to fully mitigate security concerns. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal conduct concerns are 
mitigated; however, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons 
stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information at this 
time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:     
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e to 1.g:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.g:   For Applicant 
 Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
