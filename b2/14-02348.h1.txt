MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant defaulted on a mortgage loan and on a home-improvement loan after he 
relocated for his employment. The loans were satisfied through a sale of the home in late 
March 2015. Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On October 9, 2014, Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance 
eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.

On October 16, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, and he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On October 9, 2015, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.

 On October 26, 2015, I scheduled the hearing for 
November 19, 2015. 
 
At the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and 14 Applicant exhibits (AEs 
A-N) were admitted into evidence without objection. The letter forwarding discovery from 
Department Counsel to Applicant was incorporated in the record as a hearing exhibit (HE 
1) but not admitted as an evidentiary exhibit. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript 
(Tr.) received on December 2, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
  The SOR alleges that Applicant was delinquent on two accounts as of the date of 
the SOR in that he owed a $31,400 charged-off balance (SOR ¶ 1.a) and was over 120 
days past due on an account with a $189,369 balance (SOR ¶ 1.b). When he answered 
the SOR, Applicant admitted that he owed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, which was for an in-
ground swimming pool at a home that he then had to “abandon” when he relocated for his 
present job. Applicant denied that he owed $189,369 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b in that 
the lender offered a settlement of $24,979. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and 
transcript, I make the following findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old manufacturing engineer who has a master’s degree 
awarded in 1994. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 
January 1997. He transferred to his current location in September 2012. Applicant served 
in the U.S. military in the inactive reserve from July 1976 to July 1982, when he was 
honorably discharged. He has held a DOD secret clearance since July 2004. (GE 1.) He 
requires a security clearance for his present position. (AE A.) 
 
Previously twice married and divorced, Applicant has been married to his current 
spouse since September 1993. Applicant has three children, a daughter age 26 and two 
sons, now ages 23 and 15. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant and his current wife lived in state X from approximately April 1998 to 
September 2012. They rented initially until February 2001, when they bought a single-
family home in a large subdivision for $161,189. (AEs B, C; Tr. 37.) They had a mortgage 
loan of $162,000, which they had paid on time as of its transfer in October 2014. As of 
January 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.b), their mortgage payment became $1,515, an increase of $100 
per month over their previous payment. (GE 3.) 
 
In late April 2005, Applicant and his spouse opened a home-improvement loan of 
$33,881 (SOR ¶ 1.a) to install an in-ground swimming pool and pay for some landscaping

in their backyard. Repayment was at a fixed rate of $291 per month for 245 months. (GE 3; 
AE G; Tr. 41.) The loan was secured by a deed of trust. (AE G.) 
 
On August 24, 2012, Applicant accepted an offer of a second-shift management 
position with his employer, which required him to relocate across the country at his 
expense. (AE A; Tr. 19.) His previous job was “basically terminating in [state X].” (Tr. 38.) 
Before Applicant and his spouse moved on September 27, 2012, they attempted 
unsuccessfully to refinance the mortgage loan on their home in state X for a new loan that 
would include the balance of the home-improvement loan. Their mortgage lender refused 
to accept any short sale. (GE 1; Tr. 39-40.) Property values for single-family homes in the 
area had decreased on average 8.8% from 2011, and Applicant and his spouse owed 
more on the mortgage than their home was worth. (GE 3.) The property was valued at 
$194,100 in 2011 but only at $178,500 in 2012. (AE C.) 
 
After Applicant and his family relocated for his job, their home in state X stayed 
vacant. Applicant’s daughter, who lived in a nearby city in state X, checked the home 
periodically for any signs of vandalism. (Tr. 42.) Applicant and his spouse made no 
payments on their mortgage or home-improvement loans after October 2012. (GE 3.)  
 
With a further decline of 3.35% in the market value of single-family homes from 
2012 to 2013 (AE D), Applicant and his spouse’s home in state X was valued at $165,100 
in 2013. (AE C.) Applicant did not list the home with a realtor in state X because of the 
surplus of homes for sale in the area. (Tr. 41-42.) 
 
On February 13, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He indicated that he did not have 
enough equity on his home in state X to pay the loan for the pool, and that his mortgage 
lender would not allow him to proceed with the sale of the home. He disclosed that he was 
over 120 days delinquent on balances of $189,369 for the mortgage and $28,362 for the 
home-improvement loan. (GE 1.)  
  
A check of Applicant’s credit on April 10, 2013, revealed that the creditor in SOR ¶ 
1.b now held the mortgage, which was $12,134 past due. The home-improvement loan 
was $1,751 past due on a balance of $29,796. (GE 3.) Around May 2013, the home-
improvement loan was charged off for $31,406. (GE 2.) In December 2013, the creditor 
holding the mortgage loan billed Applicant $24,915 to cover unpaid escrow, principal and 
interest, and late charges.
2
 (AE E.) Applicant made no payments. As of April 9, 2014, 
Equifax was reporting no progress toward repaying the mortgage or home-improvement 
loans. Applicant was making timely payments on his other accounts, including automobile 
loan balances of $8,075 and $2,081 opened respectively in March 2011 and August 2008. 
(GE 2.)

Applicant had mistakenly assumed that the December 2013 billing for $24,915 (AE E) was a settlement offer 
for the mortgage. (Answer.) The evidence indicates that the $24,915 was the amount to bring the mortgage 
current at the time. (Tr. 47-48.) 
 
 4 
Applicant and his spouse had stopped paying their monthly homeowners’-
association fee of $45 or $46 per month on their house in state X. (AE L; Tr. 49.) According 
to Applicant, he heard nothing from the homeowners’ association. His strategy was for the 
homeowners’ association to initiate the sale of the house to collect his and his spouse’s 
past-due fees. (Tr. 54.) On February 25, 2014, the homeowners’ association obtained a 
$2,434.82 default judgment (not alleged in SOR) against Applicant and his spouse. (AE L; 
Tr. 50.) On April 3, 2014, the judgment collector demanded that Applicant pay the 
judgment in full or execute a voluntary wage assignment for 25% of his non-exempt pay 
every payday until the judgment was satisfied. (AE M.) The judgment collector obtained a 
writ of garnishment on January 7, 2015, and $804 was garnished from Applicant’s wages 
for the pay period ending July 16, 2015. (GE H.) Applicant satisfied the judgment by 
payment of $4,912 on January 26, 2015 (AE I; Tr. 30), and the writ of garnishment was 
released on January 29, 2015. (AEs J, K.) 
 
Property values in the subdivision in state X appreciated in 2014 and again in 2015. 
Applicant’s and his spouse’s house was valued at $186,800 in 2014 and $230,000 in 2015. 
(AE C.) Applicant contacted a realtor in state X in early 2015 because houses were selling. 
(Tr. 44.) On March 31, 2015, Applicant and his spouse sold their property in state X for 
$261,000. (AE N; Tr. 47.) They had to contribute $8,000 to the buyer (AE N; Tr. 34-35), but 
both the delinquent mortgage and home-improvement loans on the property were satisfied 
through the sale. The mortgage holder received $227,048, and the bank holding the home-
improvement loan received $25,000. (AEs F, G, N; Tr. 48.) The bank holding the home-
improvement loan accepted less than the full balance in settlement. (Tr. 46.) Applicant and 
his spouse had apparently not paid any real estate taxes after they “abandoned” the 
property in state X, but they had also not been contacted about any past-due property 
taxes. (Tr. 58.) The settlement statement for the home in state X shows that Applicant and 
his spouse split county taxes for the first quarter of 2015 with the buyer. Applicant and his 
spouse paid $969 to the county for taxes owed for the second half of 2014. (AE N.) 
 
As of January 2015, Applicant’s base pay with his employer was $3,752 biweekly. 
(AE H.) He and his spouse rent their present residence. (Tr. 43.) She is employed (Tr. 59), 
although Applicant did not elaborate about her occupation or her income. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
 
 5 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The Guideline F concerns are established by the delinquent mortgage and home- 
improvement loans. Applicant and his spouse made no payments on either loan after 
October 2012. Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” are implicated. 
 
 
 6 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” applies in that the loan 
defaults were situational and not typical of Applicant’s handling of his financial affairs 
generally. However, the loans were still delinquent as of the issuance of the SOR in 
October 2014 with no evidence of payment for two years. As evidence of ongoing financial 
irresponsibility, the loan delinquencies raise legitimate doubts about Applicant’s security 
worthiness. 
 
Citing the decline in home values, Applicant and his spouse chose not to continue to 
make their mortgage and home-improvement loan payments after their mortgage lender 
would not agree to a short sale. They were unable to obtain a mortgage that would also 
cover the balance of the home-improvement loan. Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(b) partially 
applies in that Applicant had no control over the decline in real estate values in 2012 and 
2013 that left Applicant and his spouse owing more on their mortgage than their home in 
state X was worth. Additionally, while it was Applicant’s choice to accept a new position 
with his longtime employer that required him to relocate across the country, Applicant 
testified credibly that his previous job was being terminated in state X. AG ¶ 20(b) provides: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Even so, Applicant had an obligation to continue to work with his lenders toward 
acceptable resolutions after he moved in September 2012. He admits that he did little apart 
from checking to see whether properties were selling in his previous locale. It is difficult to 
find that Applicant acted fully responsibly in 2013 and 2014 when he was making no 
payments on either loan. There is no evidence that he responded to the December 2013 
billing statement from his mortgage lender for $24,915.  
 
Applicant has a stronger case in mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has 
received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” With the 
appreciation in the value of his and his spouse’s property in state X to $230,000 in 2015, 
and with homes starting to sell in the area, Applicant contacted a realtor in January 2015. 
Both loans were satisfied in the sale of the property in late March 2015. In addition, 
Applicant paid $4,912 to satisfy in full the judgment for unpaid homeowners’-association 
fees. It also appears that outstanding county taxes were paid in the sale of the home. 
There is no evidence that Applicant and his spouse owe any outstanding local real estate 
taxes associated with the property, or that Applicant is currently delinquent on any debt or 
living expense. The financial considerations concerns are fully mitigated. 
 
 7 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
My analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in the whole-person assessment of 
Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, but some factors warrant additional comment. 
Applicant has worked for his employer since 1997. While one can appreciate the difficult 
situation in which Applicant found himself in September 2012 because of the decline in 
home values, he exercised poor financial judgment when he chose to walk away from the 
property. His decisions to stop paying the loans and homeowners’-association monthly fee 
are inconsistent with the sound judgment that is required of persons with security clearance 
eligibility. His candor about the debts on his SF 86 does not relieve him of his obligation to 
his creditors. 
 
At the same time, a determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance 
should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and 
careful evaluation of the evidence to determine if a nexus exists between established facts 
and a legitimate security concern. Albeit prompted by more favorable real-estate-market 
conditions and by the homeowners’-association judgment, Applicant has alleviated through 
the sale the security concerns that arose from $220,775 in delinquent loans. He exhibits no 
ongoing financial mismanagement. After considering all the evidence, I conclude that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.b: For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
