Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from her numerous
delinquent debts that remain unsatisfied.
On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted an undated response to the SOR that was notarized on February 17, 2009. She
admitted all allegations listed in the SOR and requested a decision based on the written
record without a hearing.
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 13,
2009, that was mailed to Applicant on March 17, 2009. Applicant was informed she had

30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit her objections to any information contained
in the FORM or to submit any additional information she wanted considered. Applicant
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on April 1, 2009. Applicant submitted a letter, dated
May 1, 2009, in response to the FORM. On May 13, 2009, Department Counsel executed
a memorandum indicating she did not object to the admissibility of Applicant’s submission.
The case was assigned to me on May 28, 2009.
Findings of Fact
After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old woman who has been employed by a defense contractor
as an operator since January 2008. Her prior work history includes employment as a
nursing assistant from November 1998 to July 2003, and as a dry film operator from March
2003 to March 2005. Those jobs were followed by five different periods of employment
ranging from three to nine months when she worked as either an assembler or as a dry film
operator. 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) in July 2008 in which she indicated she attended college from 1988 to 1999 and again
from 2005 to 2006 without obtaining a degree. The CBRs contained in the FORM indicate
she was awarded over $60,000 in student loans during those years. Most of those
accounts list the method of payment “as agreed” and indicate the accounts are closed.
One student loan account, owing in the amount of $26,774, is listed as being deferred.
Applicant listed unemployment from August 2005 to May 2006 in her e-QIP while she
attended college full-time. The CBRs indicate she received a $10,523 student loan in
August 2005 at the beginning of the listed period of unemployment.
According to the information contained in Applicant’s e-QIP, she has never been
married. However, in her response to the FORM she indicated she was providing for her
children and their father who was having a difficult time finding employment. She has three
children, ages 22, 20 and 14.
The SOR lists 16 accounts that have been submitted for collection in the total
amount of $9,247, five accounts that have been charged off in the total amount of $1,921,
and one account that has resulted in a judgment being entered against Applicant in the
amount of $1,251. Applicant admitted she was liable for each of these accounts. She did
not submit anything to indicate she has made any payment on any of these accounts.
Additionally, she disclosed in her e-QIP that two garnishment orders had been entered
against her in the total amount of $4,669.08.
Many of Applicant’s delinquent accounts arise from credit card debt. Her credit
bureau reports (CBR) disclose the date of last activity on most of the delinquent accounts
occurred in either 2006 or 2007, although at least one dates back to 2004. As to one of the
garnishment orders entered against her, Applicant stated in her e-QIP that it arose from
a credit card debt that became delinquent in 1988 in the amount of $500 and has now risen
to over $2,000.

Applicant wrote in response to the FORM that she was trying to work with a credit
counseling agency in an effort to settle some of her debts. She also indicated she is paying
on the judgment that was entered against her. It is unclear from the FORM if that payment
is from one of the garnishments she admitted had been entered against her. Her
explanation for the delinquent debt is the need to provide for her children and their father.
Applicant acknowledged it will take some unspecified amount of time for her to be able to
resolve the delinquent debt. 
POLICIES
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating
conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the5
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to6
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8

 Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.11

No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant has at least 22 delinquent accounts, totalling over $12,000, that have been
either charged off, submitted for collection or that resulted in a judgment being entered
against her. Her CBRs disclose the last activity on those accounts occurred at least several
years ago. She acknowledged that one account dates back to a delinquent 1988 credit
card debt that has accumulated over $1,500 in additional interest and/or other charges
over the years. Additionally, she has at least two outstanding garnishment orders that have
been entered against her. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.
The only explanation Applicant provided for the delinquent debt is her need to
provide for her children and their father. However, the debt that she acknowledged which
dates back to 1988 precedes the birth of two of her children. She listed continuous
employment dating back to 1998 in the e-QIP she submitted, with the exception of a nine-
month period from August 2005 to May 2006 when she returned to school full-time. Her
CBRs indicate she obtained at least one student loan during this time in the amount of
$10,523. Additionally, Applicant provided no information about what efforts she may have
taken over the years to support her children and their father within the financial means
available to her from her employment and the student loans she took out. Finally, while
Applicant stated in her response to the FORM that she was working with a credit counsellor
in an effort to settle her debts, she provided no information as to what actions were actually
being taken to resolve the debts or any basis to conclude that she will resolve the debts
with the service’s assistance. 
I have considered Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted
5
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and MC 20(c): the person
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications
that the problem is being resolved or is under control and conclude they do not apply.
There is no record evidence to indicate any of the remaining mitigating conditions apply.
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
his or her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. She has not overcome the case against her
nor satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-v: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
