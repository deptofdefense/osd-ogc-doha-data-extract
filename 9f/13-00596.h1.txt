Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 30, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On an unspecified 
date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on August 11, 2009.2 On August 
5, 2013, he submitted another e-QIP (2nd e-QIP).3 On March 5, 2014, DOHA issued him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on March 26,

2014.4 On May 12, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the Department of 
Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), H 
(Drug Involvement), G (Alcohol Consumption), E (Personal Conduct), and F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 20, 2014. In a written 
statement, notarized on June 5, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on August 20, 2014. The case was assigned to 
me on August 22, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 27, 2014, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 18, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 7 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and 23 Applicant 
Exhibits (AE A through AE W) were admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant 
and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 1, 2014. I kept 
the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity, and he submitted additional documents which were admitted into evidence 
(AE X through AE Z) without objection. The record closed on October 2, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant initially denied a substantial number of 
allegations, but eventually some of those denials were revised to admissions. He has 
admitted nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.k.), drug involvement (¶¶ 2.a. and 2.b.), personal conduct (¶¶ 3.b. and 3.c.), 
alcohol consumption (¶ 4.a.), and financial considerations (¶¶ 5.a. through 5.d., 5.f., and 
5.g.) of the SOR. He denied the remaining factual allegations. Applicant’s admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:

Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a senior engineer since July 2008.5 He has no prior military service.6 A June 
1998 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor of science degree cum laude 
in electrical and computer engineering in March 2005,7 and a master of science degree 
in May 2008.8 With his father a college student and his family on food stamps during his 
youth, Applicant has been working since he was 14 years old. He went through several 
periods of unemployment: March 2005 through May 2005, June 2005 through 
November 2005, and April 2008 through May 2008, as well as some periods of 
underemployment during which he was a laborer, graduate research assistant, tennis 
court maintenance worker, and stock room associate.9 Applicant was married in 2012 
and separated sometime in August or September 2013.10  
 
Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and Alcohol Consumption 
 
 Applicant has an extensive criminal history, sometimes involving drugs and 
alcohol, which commenced in 1999 and continued through 2010. A substantial number 
of criminal incidents involved police authorities and resulted in court action. He was 
charged with a variety of crimes, convicted of a substantial number of charges, ordered 
to pay fines and court costs, and incarcerated for varying periods. In addition to the 
illegal use of drugs and the intemperate use of alcohol, the SOR alleged 12 separate 
incidents of criminal conduct:11 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): On January 31, 1999, while attending a large university fraternity 
party, Applicant was suddenly grabbed from behind by someone unknown and 
unannounced and slammed into the pavement. The assailant, who grabbed Applicant, 
turned out to be a police officer who broke his own thumb during the encounter. 
Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.12 During the trial, 
several fraternity members and police officers testified in Applicant’s behalf, and he was 
found not guilty of the charges.13

 It should be noted that there are no police reports or court documents in evidence, and all of the 
information pertaining to individual criminal incidents comes directly from Applicant or the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), acting as a clearing house for some of the information. Applicant disputed some of the information 
that appears in the personal subject interviews in evidence, contending that the investigator either misunderstood 
what Applicant had said, or inaccurately interpreted and recorded Applicant’s comments.

 (SOR ¶ 1.b.): In December 1999, another student sold Applicant an unspecified 
quantity of marijuana. Unbeknownst to Applicant, the other student was also a 
confidential police informant. A few weeks later, the informant asked Applicant to obtain 
some lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a substance Applicant had never before used or 
possessed. On four different occasions, the informant drove Applicant to a dormitory 
where Applicant obtained the LSD with the money supplied by the informant. Applicant 
turned the LSD over to the informant. On or about April 18, 2000, Applicant was indicted 
and charged with two counts of trafficking in drugs (LSD), 3rd degree felonies, and two 
counts of trafficking in drugs (LSD), 4th degree felonies. Other students were similarly 
charged, and those with attorneys were found not guilty due to entrapment. Applicant’s 
public defender failed to argue in Applicant’s behalf, and afraid of prison, Applicant 
ended up pleading guilty to a lesser offense of trafficking in drugs (LSD), 4th degree 
felonies. He was sentenced to six months at an alternate placement facility where he 
received drug, alcohol, and responsible living counseling, followed by 18 months of 
probation.14 He successfully completed the program and the probation.15 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.c.): In August 2000, while riding in the back of a friend’s truck on the 
way to a lake, the driver was pulled over for having too many people in the back of the 
truck. In his possession, Applicant, who was then 20 years old, had approximately 12 
beers and a pack of cigarette rolling papers. He was arrested and charged with 
unauthorized alcohol possession and possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant did 
not have any marijuana on him at the time. He was found guilty of unauthorized alcohol 
possession, and sentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended) and given one year of 
probation. The charge of possession of drug paraphernalia was dropped.16 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e.): On or about January 18, 2003, at around 2:00 a.m., 
Applicant’s parked car was blocked from behind, and in an effort to extricate the vehicle, 
Applicant drove between two apartment buildings. While driving through the alley, the 
vehicle slipped on some ice and made contact with a set of cement steps. The steps 
were not damaged, but the noise attracted a police officer who observed Applicant’s 
vehicle squeal the tires as it came off the curb onto the roadway. Applicant was pulled 
over outside his university dormitory and ordered to remain in the vehicle with the 
engine turned off. Because it was freezing, Applicant exited the vehicle to ask the officer 
if he could turn on the heater. The officer tackled him, charged him with leaving the 
scene of an accident, willful or wanton disregard of the safety of persons or property, 
drive on sidewalk, squealing tires and either resisting arrest or failing to comply with a 
police order. Applicant was taken to jail. At the police station, Applicant refused to

in Applicant’s possession at the time of the arrest did not, without more, qualify under state law under the 
circumstances described as “an object, instrument, or device” for illegally ingesting or inhaling a drug.

permit the police to search his anal cavity.17 He was subsequently found guilty of 
resisting arrest or failing to comply with a police order, a misdemeanor, and sentenced 
to two days in jail (suspended) and fined $100. He was also found guilty of leaving the 
scene of an accident, also a misdemeanor, and sentenced to 30 days in jail (2 days 
suspended), 366 days of probation, and fined.18 Although Applicant stated that one of 
the charges was driving under the influence (DUI), and the SOR alleged that excessive 
alcohol consumption was a factor, there is no evidence that any alcohol-related offense 
was charged or was actually a factor contributing to the incident. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): On November 11, 2004, after they had returned from a bar, 
Applicant and his girlfriend were engaged in a verbal dispute regarding her continuing 
contact with her ex-boyfriend. The argument escalated to the point that she struck him 
several times. Because of the noise coming from their apartment, a neighbor had 
alerted the police, and when the police arrived and heard the commotion, they kicked in 
the apartment door and observed Applicant sitting on top of his girlfriend’s legs, pinning 
her arms down, attempting to calm her down. He was arrested and charged with 
domestic violence and assault, both misdemeanors.19 He was convicted of domestic 
violence and sentenced to 180 days in jail (178 days suspended) and two years of 
probation. The assault charge was dismissed.20 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): On December 24, 2004, at about 2:00 a.m., Applicant and some 
friends departed a bar to smoke marijuana in the back alley. A police officer observed 
them and searched them. Small amounts of marijuana were discovered in a friend’s 
jacket pocket and in Applicant’s vehicle. Applicant was issued a citation charging him 
with disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, and possession of marijuana. He was 
convicted of disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana. The court sentenced him 
to minimum fines and costs, and his driver’s license was suspended for six months. The 
criminal trespass charge was dismissed.21 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): On February 19, 2005, after drinking earlier in the evening, 
Applicant was in his apartment listening to music before turning in for the night. 
Unbeknownst to him, one of his neighbors had called the police because of the loud 
music. Applicant was asleep in his darkened apartment when the police arrived at his 
door. When he was asked to step outside, he replied he would do so as soon as he 
could put on his shoes and turn on the porch light because there was ice on the stoop 
and Applicant was only wearing his underwear. The moment he started for the light

switch the police knocked down his door, entered his apartment (without a warrant), and 
tackled, hand-cuffed, and beat Applicant on the head with night sticks. He reflexively 
defended himself as he was taken to the ground. He was transported first to the hospital 
where he received seven stitches, and then to jail where he remained for six days. 
Applicant was also arrested and charged with felony assault and disturbing the quiet. 
The felony assault charge was reduced to misdemeanor assault. He was convicted of 
misdemeanor assault and sentenced to 30 days in jail (with 3 days credit for pretrial 
confinement, and 15 days served on weekends) and ordered to pay costs. The 
disturbing the quiet charge was dismissed.22 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): On March 24, 2005, two or three days after his undergraduate 
graduation, at about 2:00 a.m., Applicant and a friend were still socializing at a local bar, 
but no longer buying drinks, when the bar owner had them escorted out of the bar. 
Applicant’s arm was grabbed and he was pushed out the door, falling to the ground. He 
issued some “choice swear words.” As other patrons started chasing him, Applicant 
grabbed a hand-full of rocks and challenged them to back away from him. Instead, they 
pursued him. While running away, he threw some rocks. One rock struck a car window 
and another, a patron’s ankle. Applicant was tackled by a pursuing bar patron, who held 
him for the police. Applicant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault, 
aggravated menacing, and misdemeanor criminal damaging. The misdemeanor criminal 
damaging charge was reduced to criminal mischief. Applicant was denied bail and was 
ordered to remain in pre-trial confinement. On August 18, 2005, he was convicted of 
misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief, and sentenced to 240 days in jail, ordered 
to pay restitution, receive mental health counseling, and attend Alcoholics Anonymous 
(AA) meetings. Applicant completed all of the required counseling and AA meetings. He 
was placed on probation until January 20 2008. The aggravated menacing charge was 
dismissed.23  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): On April 25, 2006, while driving to work at about 7:00 a.m., 
Applicant was cut off by another driver. The occupants of both vehicles exchanged 
gestures and a passenger in the other vehicle threw an empty beer bottle out of their 
sun roof at Applicant’s vehicle. As they were pulling into a restaurant parking lot, the 
other vehicle driver “brake-checked” Applicant’s vehicle, causing Applicant to lightly 
strike the other vehicle. The passenger of the other vehicle exited the vehicle, and, 
according to Applicant, he was clearly drunk. As he approached Applicant in a 
threatening manner, Applicant chose to avoid the confrontation and departed without 
reporting the incident to the police. Later that same morning, Applicant was arrested 
and charged with driving under suspension/revocation, no operator license, and leaving 
the scene of an accident. Two months later, he was found guilty of leaving the scene of

an accident, sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended), and ordered to pay a fine and 
costs. The remaining charges were dismissed.24 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): On August 15, 2008, Applicant consumed alcohol “heavily” with 
friends during the day before falling asleep at a friend’s home. On the following day, 
after sleeping from about 4:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m., he woke up and drove home. While 
doing so, he was followed by a police officer for about two or three minutes because 
Applicant’s vehicle matched the description of another vehicle that had been observed 
driving aggressively. Although Applicant had not been driving in an unacceptable 
manner, he was pulled over. The officer could still smell the beer that Applicant 
contended he had spilled the previous day. Applicant was administered field sobriety 
tests and a breathalyzer. The breathalyzer registered 0.08 blood alcohol content. 
Applicant did not consider himself to be intoxicated. He was arrested and charged with 
driving while impaired (DWI) and misdemeanor probation violation. He was eventually 
found guilty of DWI, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to 120 days in jail (118 
suspended); he was placed on 18 months of probation (ending in September 2011); his 
driver’s license was suspended for one year; and he was ordered to attend an alcohol 
safety class; and he was fined.25 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): On March 14, 2010, upon arriving home after a night of drinking, 
Applicant was confronted with a kitchen sink or dining room table full of his roommate’s 
dirty dishes. In a state of frustration over her repeated collecting dirty dishes in her room 
and then placing them elsewhere without cleaning them, Applicant knocked some of the 
dirty dishes to the floor. The roommate, who at the time was entertaining her boyfriend, 
heard the noise and called the police. When the police arrived at the residence, 
Applicant refused to grant them entry, and he said if they attempted to enter his home 
he would “blow their heads off.” Additional police cars arrived at the house. Applicant 
was eventually arrested and charged with communicating threats, assault on a female, 
injury to personal property, and probation violation. He denied that he had ever struck 
his roommate or physically touched her. Nevertheless, in May 2010, he was found guilty 
of assault and was ordered to pay $3,290.47 in restitution, placed on probation until 
November 2012, ordered to complete a substance abuse assessment, and attend a 28-
day alcohol treatment program. The remaining charges were dismissed. He 
acknowledged that he had acted irresponsibly.26 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a. and 4.a.): As noted above, Applicant’s illegal use of drugs and his 
intemperate use of alcohol resulted in substantial incidents with law enforcement and 
judicial authorities. He started drinking alcohol when he was 14 years old. From 1994 to 
August 1998, when he started college, his alcohol consumption occurred one weekend 
a month, and consisted of eight beers. From August 1998 until November 2000, the 
frequency increased to every weekend, during which he consumed two to three six-

packs of beer. From November 2000 until April 2002, he abstained because he was on 
probation. In April 2002, his consumption soared to 12 to 18 beers three times per 
week. Once again, while on probation from February 2005 until February 2006, he 
abstained. From February 2006 to February 2010, he resumed consuming 12 to 18 
beers three times per week, or a glass of wine before dinner on a weekend. He modified 
his alcohol consumption in February 2010, and until June 2011, he only drank four 
beers every other month.  
 
Applicant enjoyed consuming alcohol in social settings as it made him feel happy 
and social. He did not realize that his drinking was excessive or that he had a problem 
with alcohol, despite attending a variety of alcohol-related programs associated with 
several court sentences. That ceased in June 2011 when he was ordered to seek an 
assessment and treatment. He successfully completed a 10-hour DUI program and a 
20-hour outpatient program stemming from his 2008 incident. Applicant now 
understands the negative impact alcohol had on his relationships with former girlfriends. 
He has successfully abstained from further consumption of alcohol since June 2011. He 
has eliminated alcohol from his life, and he intends to remain alcohol free.27  
 
(SOR ¶¶ 2.a. 2.b., and 3.d.): Applicant’s relationship with illegal drugs also 
started in 1994 as a freshman in high school when he was 14 years old. Based on 
Applicant’s estimates, the frequency of such use changed over time, and it was 
interrupted by periods of abstinence. From 1994 until 1996, he smoked marijuana once 
every other month. He abstained from 1996 until September 1998. He used it two or 
three days per week until November 2000 when he was convicted of trafficking LSD 
while in college. He abstained from further marijuana use until April 2002 when he 
resumed using it. During the period April 2002 until March 2005, Applicant estimated he 
used marijuana either three times per week or 20 to 30 times. He again abstained from 
March 2005 until September 2007, but once again, resumed using marijuana two times 
per month or 10 to 15 times until January 2008. Applicant smoked marijuana in both 
cigarettes and pipes, generally in social situations with friends. He believed that 
marijuana was a harmless drug. He purchased the marijuana on the street, but never 
cultivated or sold it.28  
 
Applicant has abstained from using marijuana since January 2008, in part, 
because he outgrew the desire to use it or to associate with those who do, and in part, 
because he was preparing for a job search. He contends that his lifestyle has changed 
tremendously since he is no longer a student from a poor family who could be lured or 
exposed to unacceptable activities, including drugs. He is more active in his nephews’ 
sports, science projects, and church activities as well as his own sports and exercising. 
He acknowledged that he exercised “a very poor lack of judgment and choice of 
friends,” and he regrets his past behavior. He avoids associating with those who use

In February 2011, following his May 2010 conviction for assault, Applicant was 
sent by the department of probation and parole for an evaluation by a forensic 
psychotherapist. The mental status examination noted: 
 
Certainly no suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation in evidence but he did 
acknowledge having a short fuse and indeed he has been involved in 
some interventions to help him keep that at bay. He states that especially 
since he has abandoned [alcohol] that he is successfully able to control 
that difficulty and so that it has not really presented any problems with him 
interpersonally. We really do not have any difficulty with impulsivity, 
paranoia, threat, interpersonal conflict, irritability, aggression per se 
outside of him acknowledging that he does tend to get rather short 
tempered when it comes to imperfections which of course is a function of 
his personality. He was certainly of superior intelligence. He had insight 
into his difficulty, was motivated to be here by court order. His range of 
affect was not limited. There were no signs of organicity with recent and 
remote memory intact and his judgment appeared to be grossly intact.30 
 
Applicant’s Axis I diagnosis (clinical disorders) was Adult Antisocial Behavior (V71.01), 
and his Axis II diagnosis (personality disorders) was Deferred (799.9).31 There were no 
diagnoses made of any alcohol use disorders such as Alcohol Dependence (303.90) or 
Alcohol Abuse (305.00), or cannabis use disorders such as Cannabis Dependence 
(304.30) or Cannabis Abuse (305.20). 
 
 (SOR ¶ 3.d.): When Applicant was ordered to complete a 28-day treatment 
program following his May 2010 conviction for assault, he was unable to gain admission 
into any inpatient treatment program. During his telephone interviews with 10 to 15 
prospective treatment centers, Applicant acknowledged that he had not been drinking 
heavily, was no longer using drugs, and had already been on probation for a year. His 
insurance company refused to cover his treatment because there was no medical 
necessity. Because of his inability to gain admission to a program, when Applicant 
informed his probation officer, it was determined that Applicant would violate the terms 
of his probation if he failed to gain acceptance to a program. At that point, Applicant 
decided that to gain admission to a program, he had to do what was necessary, such as 
exaggerate his drug and alcohol use, to do so. The decision had nothing to do with 
insurance, because Applicant had the funds to pay for the program without insurance.

The decision was simply to be admitted. Accordingly, during his intake interview, 
Applicant told the interviewer that he consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana every 
day.  
 
After he was accepted into the program, Applicant was interviewed by the 
attending physician for about one hour. He stated that he had used the following 
substances: marijuana daily, with the most recent such use the day before the interview; 
alcohol two to three times per week, with the most recent such use two days before the 
interview; cocaine rarely, most recent such use a year and one-half before the interview; 
and opiates pills, benzodiazepine, LSD, PCP, MDMA, and spray paint, with the most 
recent such use during his teen years. He attended two group education lectures on 
alcoholism (post-treatment pharmacology of alcoholism) and domestic violence. He was 
administered a urinalysis test, and the result came back negative for the presence of 
drugs.32 With the absence of any medical necessity, Applicant was successfully 
discharged from the program after 15 days.33 
 
Applicant’s discharge diagnoses were: Axis I diagnoses (clinical disorders): 
Cannabis Dependence, Alcohol Dependence, Cocaine Abuse, Opiate Abuse, 
Hallucinogen Abuse (partial remission), Benzodiazepine Abuse (sustained full 
remission), Inhalant Abuse (sustained full remission), and Nicotine Dependence; Axis II: 
no diagnosis; Axis V: Current GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale): 45.34 
Despite the relatively low GAF, Applicant was discharged “in stable condition with ad-lib 
activities and diet.” He was instructed to attend 90 meetings of AA in 90 days, obtain a 
sponsor, and associate closely with the 12-Step Recovery Program. No medications 
were prescribed.35 His prognosis was “fair to good” as long as he remained with the 
continuing care plan.36 Applicant complied with all aspects of the plan even after 
completing his period of probation. He completed the 12-Step Recovery Program and 
has served as a sponsor for others in the AA program. He recited the Serenity Prayer 
from memory.37 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 (SOR ¶ 3.a.): On January 30, 2009, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to a question pertaining to drug use. The question in Section 24 asked

part covers functioning. Applicant’s GAF of 45 falls within the range where his symptom severity is described as  
“serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting,” and his functioning 
includes “any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a

essentially if, in the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or controlled 
substances. Applicant answered the question with “yes,” and added that he had 
between 20 and 30 occasions from April 2002 to March 2005.38 He certified that the 
response was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief. His 
response to the question was incomplete, for Applicant omitted or concealed his 
marijuana use during the period September 2007 to January 2008. He answered the 
same question in his 2nd e-QIP in 2013 with a “yes” and acknowledging having used 
marijuana on 10 to 15 occasions during the period September 2007 to January 2008.39 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied intending to falsify his response, claiming 
that he mistakenly and inadvertently forgot the infrequent marijuana use while he was in 
graduate school. He characterized the omission as an accidental mistake and oversight 
which he did not realize until he completed his 4th step inventory with his AA sponsor in 
March 2012.40  
 
 (SOR ¶ 3.b.): During Applicant’s interview with the investigator from the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in April 6, 2009, he acknowledged that he had 
used marijuana between 20 and 30 occasions from April 2002 to March 2005. The SOR 
alleged that Applicant “falsely stated [he] last used marijuana in March 2005,” but that 
interpretation is not supported by the evidence. Applicant did not say his last use was in 
March 2005, he merely indicated that he had used it during that period, as well as 
earlier periods, and that he had no intentions of using it in the future.41 In his Answer to 
the SOR, Applicant denied intending to falsify his response, claiming that he mistakenly 
and inadvertently forgot the infrequent marijuana use because the earlier use was much 
more pronounced and ingrained in his memory. He characterized the omission as an 
accidental mistake and oversight which he did not realize until he completed his 4th step 
inventory with his AA sponsor in March 2012.42  
 
 (SOR ¶ 3.c.): In his response to interrogatories on August 11, 2009, Applicant 
acknowledged that he had used marijuana between 20 and 30 occasions from April 
2002 to March 2005, and about 100 to 300 times from August 1994 until November 
2000. The SOR alleged that Applicant “falsely reported that [he] last used marijuana in 
March 2005,” but that interpretation is also not supported by the evidence. Applicant did 
not say his last use was in March 2005; he merely indicated that he had used it during 
those periods; that he decided to stop using illegal substances after he graduated in 
2005; and that he did not plan on smoking marijuana in the future.43 In his Answer to the 
SOR, Applicant denied intending to falsify his response, claiming that he mistakenly and

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant initially started experiencing financial difficulties, 
although it appears that in mid-2008, following his graduation from graduate school, 
some financial difficulties arose because of Applicant’s brief period of unemployment 
and substantial periods of underemployment. At various points thereafter, he owed rent 
to his brother; was paying high-interest payday loans; had experienced unexpected, and 
unspecified, medical emergencies; was paying unspecified out-of-pocket medical 
expenses; had to pay court-order restitution; posted bond for criminal incidents; was 
paying attorney’s fees associated with his criminal incidents; and was paying for various 
drug and alcohol assessments, evaluations, and treatment programs. In addition, 
Applicant attributed some of his problems to poor financial advice in dealing with old 
debts. He was advised to pay his debts one at a time rather than setting up a plan with 
a uniform approach. He was financially naïve and inexperienced.45 As a result, 
Applicant was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments, and some 
accounts became delinquent. The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing 
delinquencies as reflected by credit reports from September 201346 and August 2014,47 
totaling approximately $55,113. Those debts and their respective current status, 
according to the credit reports, other evidence in the case file, and Applicant’s 
admissions regarding the same, are described below.  
 
(SOR ¶ 5.a.): There is an automobile loan account with a high credit of $19,219 
that was past due when the balance of $10,836 was charged off in February 2010.48 
Applicant stated that he was working with the creditor who changed the payment-due 
dates, but he was behind in his payments 91 days, with the anticipated payment in 
hand, when the vehicle was repossessed in December 2009.49 He subsequently 
arranged a settlement with the collection agent in the amount of $5,852, and on 
September 15, 2014, made two payments of $2,852.47 and $2,999.99, including fees.50 
The account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 5.b.): There is a bank credit card account with a high credit of $1,647 that 
was past due when the balance of $1,646 was charged off in January 2009.51 Applicant 
subsequently arranged a settlement with the collection agent in the amount of $987, 
and on September 14, 2014, made a payment of $987.73.52 The account has been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 5.c.): There is a credit card account with a high credit of $2,337 that was 
past due (90 days) $108 with an unpaid balance of $1,592 when the account was 
closed by the grantor in September 2009.53 It was transferred or sold to a collection 
agent. Applicant subsequently arranged a settlement with the collection agent in the 
amount of $892, and on September 16, 2014, made a payment of $892.54 The account 
has been resolved.

high credit of $608 that was past due when the balance of $599 was charged off in 
November 2009.55 Applicant subsequently paid the collection agent $599.09 on 
September 11, 2014.56 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 5.e.): There is a mobile telephone account with an unpaid balance of 
$1,097 that was placed for collection in October 2008.57 It was transferred or sold to a 
collection agent. Applicant denied making a three-hour phone call that led to a $500 
charge with additional fees and charges.58 He successfully disputed the account with 
the credit reporting agencies, and the negative report was removed from all of his credit 
reports.59 The account has been resolved.

his May 2010 conviction for assault.60 Applicant subsequently paid the collection agent 
$715 on September 15, 2014.61 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 5.g.): There are student loans totaling approximately $38,628 that were 
purportedly “outstanding.” The SOR does not specify which accounts are “outstanding,” 
or what the term means. There is no evidence that the student loans are in any status 
but current. Furthermore, Applicant steadfastly denied that any of his student loans 
were delinquent.62 Applicant has a number of student loans that were reported in his 
September 2013 credit report as “pays as agreed,” or “payment deferred,” or even 
“transferred: account closed,” but there are no student loans reported as being 
delinquent, or in forbearance, or in default.63 The same is true for his most recent credit 
reports.64 The student loan accounts are current, without the necessity of resolving 
them. 
 
Applicant’s current annual salary is $84,000. On the hearing date, he estimated 
having $1,800 in his checking account and $5,000 in his savings account. His 401(k) 
retirement account, as of September 11, 2014, was worth $52,312.65 As of July 15, 
2014, Applicant’s credit scores from the three major credit reporting agencies were 
reflected as 624, 637, and 606.66 In addition to resolving all of his SOR-related 
accounts, Applicant resolved a variety of accounts that were not alleged in the SOR.67  
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 The chief executive officer of Applicant’s employer has known Applicant since he 
was hired in July 2008, and they have daily contact with each other. He is effusive in 
support of Applicant and referred to him as a creative, intelligent engineer and scientist 
who has come up with very novel process and ideas. Applicant’s work performance has 
been outstanding, and he has been promoted and received several significant pay 
increases over the past four years. Applicant generally arrives at the office around 8:00-
8:15 am each morning, and rarely leaves the office without his laptop computer to work 
additional hours from home on evenings and weekends. Applicant has never come to 
work intoxicated or smelling of alcohol. He noted that Applicant had engaged a personal

coach to assist him in understanding his intensity and to improve his personal decision-
making.68  
 
Two co-workers are also very supportive of Applicant’s application. They have 
characterized him as a creative and intelligent engineer whose work ethic is focused 
and dedicated. He is generally cheerful and optimistic with a personal desire to improve, 
and he is extremely reliable and professional.69 One of them discussed a noted 
maturation in Applicant’s “non-work self.” 70 Another individual, who has known 
Applicant for 30 years, is well aware of Applicant’s early circumstances as well as his 
subsequent travails, and he has been impressed with Applicant’s ability to grow from a 
young kid making mistakes to “an incredible person that is an asset to his community 
and his company that he works for.” Applicant was characterized as loyal, intelligent, 
and hard-working.71 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”72 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”73   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of

variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”74 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.75  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”76 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”77 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), a “single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses” is potentially 
disqualifying. Also, a security concern may be raised under AG ¶ 31(c), when there is 
an “allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.” As noted above, Applicant’s 
criminal history is lengthy and varied. In addition to the illegal use of marijuana and the 
intemperate use of alcohol, there were 12 separate incidents of criminal conduct 
involving police activities and court action over an 11-year period. He was charged with 
a variety of crimes, convicted of a substantial number of charges, ordered to pay fines 
and court costs, and incarcerated for varying periods. AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(c) have been 
established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply where “there is evidence of successful 
rehabilitation: including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of 
criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good 
employment record, or constructive community involvement.”  
 
AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) apply. Commencing in 1999, when he was 19 years old, 
and continuing until 2010, when he was 29 years old, Applicant was involved in a 
number of incidents that resulted in arrests, criminal charges, convictions, and 
sentencing.  He was also acquitted of some charges and other charges were dismissed. 
Some of the incidents involved alcohol, some involved marijuana and LSD, and others 
were a combination of alcohol and a hot temper. Applicant grew up in poverty, and 
never developed an appreciation for self-control. While he was apparently book-smart, 
his social skills were associated with naivety, and he used alcohol or marijuana with his 
peers. Influenced by too much alcohol, Applicant soon found himself in a spiral of self-
destruction becoming involved both innocently and actively in an extensive array of 
criminal conduct. Nothing fazed him, for arrests, convictions, jail, probation, and fines, 
had no positive impact on him. His environment – undergraduate and graduate school – 
was generally the environment of alcohol and marijuana. 
 
 
18 
                                      
 
 Because of the proliferation of Applicant’s criminal conduct, it cannot be 
characterized as isolated criminal conduct. However, once Applicant escaped his 
university environment and entered his current professional environment, things 
changed. A new paradigm was established when Applicant cast aside his criminal 
behavior, ceased using marijuana, and stopped consuming alcohol. In the past, 
Applicant could not exist for three years without some criminal conduct taking place. 
However, once he decided to abstain from marijuana in January 2008, there have been 
no marijuana-related criminal conduct, and once he embraced abstinence from alcohol 
in June 2011, there have been no alcohol-related criminal incidents. With the assistance 
of accumulated education and therapy from the various programs, as well as his newly-
developed maturity, Applicant has not been involved in criminal conduct since March 
2010 – a period of nearly five years. Given his appreciation of life without the burdens of 
alcohol and marijuana, his good employment record, and his repeatedly stated remorse 
for his past actions, Applicant has been successfully rehabilitated, and his criminal 
conduct is unlikely to recur. It no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG & 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 25(a), “any drug abuse (see above definition),” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 25(c), “illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,” may 
raise security concerns. Also, a “diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence” may 
raise security concerns under AG ¶ 25(d). 
 
19 
                                      
 
Applicant started using marijuana in 1994 and continued using it, interrupted by 
periods of abstinence, until January 2008. In the absence of a detailed ledger, based on 
Applicant’s guesstimates, the frequency of such use changed over time. He smoked 
marijuana in both cigarettes and pipes, generally in social situations with friends. He 
purchased the marijuana on the street, but never cultivated or sold it. In November 2000 
he was convicted of trafficking LSD while in college. In December 2005, he was 
convicted of possession of marijuana. In February 2011, Applicant was sent by the 
department of probation and parole for an evaluation by a forensic psychotherapist. The 
diagnoses were: Axis I: Adult Antisocial Behavior (V71.01); Axis II: Deferred (799.9). 
There were no diagnoses made of any alcohol use disorders such as Alcohol 
Dependence (303.90) or Alcohol Abuse (305.00), or cannabis use disorders such as 
Cannabis Dependence (304.30) or Cannabis Abuse (305.20). 
 
However, because of Applicant’s embellishment of his drug history to enable him 
to gain admission into the 28-day inpatient treatment program, upon his discharge from 
that treatment program, Applicant’s diagnoses were: Axis I: Cannabis Dependence, 
Alcohol Dependence, Cocaine Abuse, Opiate Abuse, Hallucinogen Abuse (partial 
remission), Benzodiazepine Abuse (sustained full remission), Inhalant Abuse (sustained 
full remission), and Nicotine Dependence. AG ¶¶ 25(a), 25(c), and 25(d) have been 
established.  
  The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying conditions 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Under AG ¶ 26(b), 
drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is: 
a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) 
disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or 
avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate 
period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic 
revocation of clearance for any violation. 
In addition, where there is a “satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment 
program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without 
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical 
professional,” AG ¶ 26(d) may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 26(a), 26(b), and 26(d) apply. Applicant’s drug involvement can be divided 
into three distinctly separate groupings. The first group, related to marijuana involved 
his lengthy history of marijuana possession and use that commenced in 1994, but 
ceased in January 2008 – seven years ago. The second group is related to LSD. 
Applicant’s explanation – the only one in evidence – was that he was ensnared in a 
sting operation by another student who was confidential police informant. The informant 
asked Applicant to obtain some LSD, a substance Applicant had never before used or 
possessed. On four different occasions, the informant drove Applicant to a dormitory 
 
20 
                                      
 
where Applicant obtained the LSD with the money supplied by the informant. Applicant 
turned the LSD over to the informant. In April 2000, Applicant was indicted and charged 
with trafficking in drugs (LSD). He was subsequently convicted. There is no evidence 
that Applicant ever used LSD. In the ensuing 15 years since Applicant’s indictment, 
there is no evidence that he has had any more recent involvement with LSD.  
The third group is related to his purported use of cocaine, opiates pills, 
benzodiazepine, LSD, PCP, MDMA, and spray paint. The forensic psychotherapist 
found no current drug-related diagnosis. The only evidence of such purported use arose 
from Applicant’s embellishment of his drug history to enable him to gain admission into 
the 28-day inpatient treatment program. He had never actually used the substances he 
listed. The stated diagnoses are internally inconsistent, and there is no evidence that 
they comply with the analysis required under the DSM-IV-TR. For example, Applicant 
told the treatment program intake interviewer that he had used marijuana the day before 
the interview and alcohol two days before the interview. Yet, when the urinalysis results 
came back, the results were negative. Applicant claimed he had rarely used cocaine, 
with the most recent such use a year and one-half before the interview. He also stated 
he had used opiates pills, benzodiazepine, LSD, PCP, MDMA, and spray paint, with the 
most recent such use during his teen years. Nevertheless, despite only a one-hour 
interview and the negative urinalysis, Applicant’s Axis I discharge diagnoses were: 
Cannabis Dependence, Alcohol Dependence, Cocaine Abuse, Opiate Abuse, 
Hallucinogen Abuse (partial remission), Benzodiazepine Abuse (sustained full 
remission), Inhalant Abuse (sustained full remission), and Nicotine Dependence.  
Applicant satisfactorily completed the treatment program and was instructed to 
attend 90 meetings of AA in 90 days, obtain a sponsor, and associate closely with the 
12-Step Recovery Program. No medications were prescribed. His prognosis was “fair to 
good” as long as he remained with the continuing care plan. Applicant complied with all 
aspects of the plan even after completing his period of probation. He completed the 12-
Step Recovery Program and has served as a sponsor for others in the AA program. 
Applicant has demonstrated a clear intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. He has 
avoided his former drug-using associates and contacts; he has avoided the campus 
environment where he used marijuana; he has vowed never to use illegal drugs in the 
future; and most significantly, he has abstained from any drug abuse for seven years. 
Applicant’s former drug involvement is unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out 
in AG ¶ 21:  
      
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  
 
 
21 
                                      
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 22(a), “alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of 
concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or 
alcohol dependent” is potentially disqualifying. In addition, “habitual or binge 
consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the 
individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,” may apply under 
AG ¶ 22(c). Similarly, a “diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence” 
is of security significance under AG ¶ 22(d). Applicant started drinking alcohol when he 
was 14 years old. From 1994 to June 2011, the frequency and quantity of his alcohol 
consumption varied. It was periodically interrupted by periods of abstinence. From 
August 1998 until November 2000, the frequency increased to every weekend, during 
which he consumed two to three six-packs of beer. From November 2000 until April 
2002 he abstained because he was on probation. In April 2002, his consumption once 
again soared to 12 to 18 beers three times per week. Once again, while on probation 
from February 2005 until February 2006, he abstained. From February 2006 to 
February 2010, he resumed consuming 12 to 18 beers three times per week. Applicant 
enjoyed consuming alcohol in social settings as it made him feel happy and social. 
Applicant was also involved in a number of alcohol-related incidents that resulted in 
alcohol-related charges, including unauthorized possession of alcohol, DUI, DWI, 
criminal mischief, assault, and domestic violence.  During the 28-day inpatient treatment 
program, Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence. AG ¶¶ 22(a), 22(c), and 
22(d) have been established. 
 
 The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from alcohol consumption. Under AG ¶ 23(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where “so much time has passed, or the behavior was so 
infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” In addition, when “the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or 
issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, 
and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if 
an alcohol abuser)”, AG ¶ 23(b) may apply. In addition, AG ¶ 23(d) may be established 
where: 
 
the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
AG ¶¶ 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) apply. While Applicant’s relationship with alcohol 
was a long-standing one, he did not realize that his drinking was excessive or that he 
 
22 
                                      
 
had a problem with alcohol despite attending a variety of alcohol-related programs 
associated with several court sentences. That ceased in June 2011 when he was 
ordered to seek an assessment and treatment. He successfully completed a 10-hour 
DUI program and a 20-hour outpatient program stemming from his 2008 incident. In 
July 2011, when he enrolled in a 28-day treatment program following his May 2010 
conviction for assault, Applicant was diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence.  
Applicant satisfactorily completed the treatment program, and was instructed to 
attend 90 meetings of AA in 90 days, obtain a sponsor, and associate closely with the 
12-Step Recovery Program. No medications were prescribed. His prognosis was “fair to 
good” as long as he remained with the continuing care plan. Applicant complied with all 
aspects of the plan even after completing his period of probation. He completed the 12-
Step Recovery Program and has served as a sponsor for others in the AA program. 
Applicant now understands the negative impact alcohol had on his relationships with 
former girlfriends. Applicant has demonstrated a clear intent not to consume alcohol in 
the future. He has successfully abstained from further consumption of alcohol since 
June 2011 – over three and one-half years. He has eliminated alcohol from his life, and 
he intends to remain alcohol free. Applicant’s alcohol abuse is unlikely to recur and no 
longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is a 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  
 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately providing false or misleading information 
concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative” may raise security 
concerns. Additionally, security concerns may be raised under AG ¶ 16(c) if there is 
 
 
23 
                                      
 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
 
Applicant’s omissions and concealments in his responses to inquiries during the 
completion of his e-QIP, during his OPM interview, and in his responses to the 
interrogatories, of information pertaining to his substance abuse, provide sufficient 
evidence to examine if Applicant’s answers and comments were deliberate falsifications 
pertaining to critical information, as alleged in the SOR, or were the result of confusion, 
forgetfulness, or misunderstanding on his part. I had ample opportunity to evaluate the 
demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which 
he responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and 
listen to his testimony. Applicant did not say his last use of marijuana was in March 
2005, he merely indicated that he had used it during certain periods, and that he had no 
intentions of using it in the future. Applicant denied intending to falsify his responses, 
claiming that he mistakenly and inadvertently forgot the infrequent marijuana use while 
he was in graduate school. Applicant furnished very detailed frequency estimates 
regarding his marijuana use which commenced in 1994. In the absence of a ledger or 
notes upon a calendar which might memorialize his actual marijuana use, the fact that 
he gave substantial notice of substance abuse, albeit somewhat faulty descriptions of 
that abuse, should not be considered, without more, to be deliberate falsifications. He 
characterized the omissions as accidental mistakes and oversight which he did not 
realize until he completed his 4th step inventory with his AA sponsor in March 2012. He 
answered the same question in his 2nd e-QIP in 2013 with a “yes,” and acknowledged 
that he had used marijuana on 10 to 15 occasions during the period in question. 
Applicant’s explanations regarding those answers support his position that he was not 
attempting to conceal or falsify the true facts. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) (relating to the 
OPM investigator) have not been established.78  
 
In June 2011, when Applicant was ordered to complete a 28-day treatment 
program following his May 2010 conviction for assault, he was unable to gain admission 
into any inpatient treatment program. During his telephone interviews with prospective 
treatment centers, Applicant acknowledged that he had not been drinking heavily, was 
                                                          
78
 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission. 
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). 
 
24 
                                      
 
no longer using drugs, and had already been on probation for a year. His insurance 
company refused to cover his treatment because there was no medical necessity. 
Applicant was faced with a dilemma. Because his inability to gain admission to a 
program, when Applicant informed his probation officer, it was determined that Applicant 
would violate the terms of his probation if he failed to gain acceptance to a program. He 
then decided that to gain admission, he had to do what was necessary, such as 
exaggerate his drug and alcohol use, to do so. The decision had nothing to do with 
insurance, because Applicant had the funds to pay for the program without insurance. 
The decision was simply to be admitted to the treatment program or face a probation 
violation. AG ¶ 16(b) (relating to the competent medical authority) has not been 
established. 
 
The SOR did not allege Applicant’s criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, 
general substance abuse involvement (as opposed to the marijuana abuse during 
September 2007 to January 2008), or his financial considerations under the personal 
conduct guideline. Accordingly, AG ¶ 16(d) has not been established. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Also, “financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, 
gambling problems, or other issues of security concern” are potentially disqualifying 
under AG ¶ 19(f). As noted above, Applicant had to pay court-ordered restitution; 
posted bond for criminal incidents; was paying attorney’s fees associated with his 
criminal incidents; and was paying for various drug and alcohol assessments, 
evaluations, and treatment programs. Some of his accounts were placed for collection, 
and a vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
 
25 
                                      
 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”79 When “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof 
to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue,” AG ¶ 20(e) may apply. 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. In mid-2008, following his 
graduation from graduate school, Applicant began experiencing some financial 
difficulties because of his brief period of unemployment and substantial periods of 
underemployment. At various points thereafter, he owed rent to his brother; was paying 
high-interest payday loans; had experienced unexpected, and unspecified, medical 
emergencies; was paying unspecified out-of-pocket medical expenses; had to pay 
court-ordered restitution; posted bond for criminal incidents; was paying attorney’s fees 
associated with his criminal incidents; and was paying for various drug and alcohol 
assessments, evaluations, and treatment programs. Some of those issues were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control, but those expenses that arose because of his drug 
involvement, excessive consumption of alcohol, and his other criminal incidents 
involving police authorities and the courts can be in some measure both within and 
beyond his control. To an extent, Applicant’s drug involvement and excessive alcohol 
consumption may have reduced his ability to avoid his criminal conduct. However, 
Applicant’s incremental approach to his various problems led him to abstain from drug 
involvement in January 2008, from criminal conduct in March 2010, and from alcohol 
consumption in June 2011. He was then free to focus on his financial issues. Applicant 
attributed some of his problems to poor financial advice in dealing with old debts. He 
was advised to pay his debts one at a time rather than setting up a plan with a uniform 
approach. Applicant was financially naïve and inexperienced.  
 
The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by 
credit reports from 2013 and 2014, totaling approximately $55,113. Of that figure there 
                                                          
79
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
26 
                                      
 
are student loans totaling approximately $38,628 that were purportedly “outstanding.” 
The SOR does not specify which accounts are “outstanding,” or what the term means. 
There is no evidence that the student loans are in any status but current. Furthermore, 
Applicant steadfastly denied that any of his student loans were delinquent. His student 
loans were reported in his credit reports as “pays as agreed,” or “payment deferred,” or 
even “transferred: account closed,” but there were no student loans reported as being 
delinquent, or in forbearance, or in default. The student loan accounts are current, 
without the necessity of resolving them. One account was successfully disputed, and 
that account is no longer listed in Applicant’s credit report. Applicant contacted the 
creditors or collection agents for the remaining delinquent accounts and resolved them. 
He no longer has any delinquent accounts. Applicant acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.80  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
        
There is significant disqualifying evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. 
Applicant’s criminal history is lengthy and varied. Commencing in 1999, when he was 
19 years old, and continuing until 2010, when he was 29 years old, Applicant was 
involved in a number of incidents that resulted in arrests, criminal charges, convictions, 
and sentencing. He was also acquitted of some charges and other charges were 
dismissed. Some of the incidents involved alcohol, some involved marijuana and LSD, 
and others were a combination of alcohol and a hot temper. Influenced by too much 
alcohol, Applicant soon found himself in a spiral of self-destruction becoming involved in 
an extensive array of criminal conduct. Nothing fazed him. His arrests, convictions, jail,

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No.

probation, and fines had no positive impact on him. His environment – undergraduate 
and graduate school – was generally the environment of alcohol and marijuana. In 
addition, he encountered financial difficulties. 
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant grew up in poverty, and never developed an appreciation for self-control. 
While he was apparently book-smart, his social skills were associated with naivety, and 
he used alcohol or marijuana as part of his relationship with his peers. Once Applicant 
escaped his university environment and entered his current professional environment, 
things changed. A new paradigm was established when Applicant cast aside his 
criminal behavior, ceased using marijuana, and stopped consuming alcohol. He decided 
to abstain from marijuana in January 2008, and there has been no subsequent 
marijuana-related criminal conduct. Once he embraced abstinence from alcohol in June 
2011, there have been no alcohol-related criminal incidents. With the assistance of 
accumulated education and therapy from the various programs, as well as his newly-
developed maturity, Applicant has not been involved in criminal conduct since March 
2010 – a period of nearly five years. Given his appreciation of life without the burdens of 
alcohol and marijuana, his good employment record, and his repeatedly stated remorse 
for his past actions, Applicant appears to have been successfully rehabilitated, and his 
criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. It no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. He has resolved all of his delinquent debts, and 
there are clear indications that his financial problems are under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:81 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. After a dismal period of criminal conduct, substance abuse, and 
alcohol abuse, he has also established a positive paradigm of abstinence, and good 
conduct, in addition to an outstanding employment record. Nevertheless, this decision 
should serve as a warning that his failure to continue his drug and alcohol abstinence, 
or his renewed involvement in criminal conduct, or the actual accrual of new delinquent 
debts, will adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.82 Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct, drug 
involvement, alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and financial considerations. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s conduct, substance or alcohol abstinence, or 
financial condition. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an 
applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR 
Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
