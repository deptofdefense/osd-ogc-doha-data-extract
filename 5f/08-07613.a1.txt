FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On January 15, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline
B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline D ( Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.
On June 4, 2009, after considering the record, Administrative Judge David M. White denied
Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28
and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his analysis of the
pertinent mitigating conditions.  Finding no error, we affirm.
The Judge found that, since 2002, Applicant has conducted an extra-marital affair with a
woman from Ecuador.  He has not disclosed the affair to anyone except a friend.  He has not advised
his supervisors or his spouse.  He has paid the woman approximately $100 per month and has
purchased cell phones for her to resell.  When asked on his security clearance application (SCA) to
list foreign associates, Applicant did not list the woman.  The Judge concluded that, under the
circumstances, Applicant is “subject to duress.”  Decision at 12.  
In his brief, Applicant presents new evidence not contained in the record, including medical
information which purportedly would demonstrate that he did not intend to falsify his SCA.  The
Board cannot consider this evidence.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29. (“No new evidence shall be received
or considered by the Appeal Board”).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3,
2009).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data
and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between
the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge’s decision that “it is not clearly consistent with the interests
of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance” is sustainable
on this record.  Decision at 13.  See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)
(“The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security.’”).
