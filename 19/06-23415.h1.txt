SYNOPSIS
On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative1
Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R,
Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.
From October 2005 until January 2007, Applicant had a relationship with an
Indonesian woman, whom he met over the internet. He lived in Japan at the time.
She later moved to Japan. He has since terminated the relationship and returned to
the States. Applicant mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.
Clearance is granted.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On January 22, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application
(SF 86). On February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  The SOR alleges security concerns1
under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer notarized on March 22, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On April 30, 2007, the
case was assigned me. On May 15, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the
hearing for June 5, 2007. At the hearing the Government introduced two exhibits
into evidence that were marked Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 and admitted into
evidence without objection. Applicant’s Exhibits (AX), marked A through N, were
introduced without objection. The record was left open until June 12, 2007, to give
Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information.  On June 12, 2007, that
deadline was extended to June 15, 2007, by order. DOHA received the hearing
transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2007.  
PROCEDURAL RULING
Department Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in
Government Exhibits (GX) 3 through 12. Applicant did not object to me taking
administrative notice of those documents, as they relate to Indonesia and Japan. (Tr.
7-8). 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,
2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well
known or from government reports. See Stein, AD M IN IST R A T IV E  LA W , Section 25.01
(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took
administrative notice of the facts under subheading “Indonesia” and “Japan” of this
decision, which are derived from GX 3 through 12. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant admitted he had a romantic
relationship with a woman who is a citizen of Indonesia and a current resident of
Japan. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. Having come from a family of military servicemen,
he enlisted in the Air Force after completing high school in 1986. He was a Senior
Airman (E4) when he was honorably discharged in September 1992. (GX 2 at 5). He
obtained a security clearance in 1987. (Tr. 20). 
 
In 1987, Applicant was sent to Japan where he was on active duty for five
years. (Id.). While there he met his wife, a Japanese citizen, whom he married in
1992. They have three children, ages 13, 9 and 6. (Tr. 22). After leaving the Air
Force, he remained in Japan and taught English for a couple years.  From October
1994 to October 1996, he worked as a computer technician at an air terminal. (Tr.
28). He then worked for a federal contractor as a CADD database administrator for a
civil engineer squadron until January 2007, when he left Japan and returned to the
States. (Tr. 29). He did not have access to classified information in his former
position. (Tr. 57). In his present job, he does not have access to classified
information, but will need a secret security clearance in order to work on classified
networks in the future. (Tr. 57; 70). 
Sometime in 2000, Applicant’s relationship with his wife began to deteriorate,
becoming progressively strained by the middle of 2002. (Tr. 31-32). Over the next
couple years, many of his friends left Japan and he began feeling very lonely. (Tr.
33).  In October 2005, he initiated communication over the internet with a woman
who was a citizen and resident of Indonesia. (Tr. 36). In February 2006, he flew to
Indonesia for a few days to meet her. (Tr. 37). The next time he saw her was in April
2006 in Japan after she accepted a position in a medical program there. (Tr. 39). The
relationship became romantic in September 2006 and continued until January 2007
when he left Japan. (Tr. 39). In March 2007, he completely terminated the
relationship, after realizing that he needed to change his personal situation and
learning that his interaction with the woman could jeopardize his employment. (Tr.
50; 63). He has not seen her since January 2007 and has not communicated with her
since March 2007. He has no intention of returning to Japan. (Tr. 46). None of the
woman’s family members are connected to the Indonesian government. (Tr. 61).
T he  contents o f the  Indonesia  section are  from G X  3 , 4  and  5 .2
Currently, Applicant is separated from his wife and he intends to seek a
divorce. (Tr. 50). She and the children live in Japan. He speaks to his wife twice a
month, but calls his children several times a week. (Tr. 46). He would like his
children to live with him in the future. He told his wife about the relationship with
the Indonesian woman in October 2006. (Tr. 41). He also told his father. (Tr. 65).
 Applicant was very candid about his connections to foreign nationals and his
relationship with the Indonesian woman in the interrogatories he submitted to the
Government in December 2006. (Tr. 51; GX 2). He is embarrassed by his actions and
acknowledges the employment and personal problems that were created as a result of
his indiscretions. (Tr. 52; 54).  His expression of remorse was very credible.
Applicant submitted 15 character letters from colleagues, friends and family,
who have known him over the years. All of them are supportive and speak highly of
his character, loyalty and trustworthiness. Some of them are aware that his security
clearance has been detained because of his relationships to people in Japan. He
would disclose more details to his employer if necessary. (Tr. 69). One of his
colleagues, who also served in the military, has known Applicant since 2001 when
they worked together in Japan. He claims that Applicant “is American to the core; I
have no reason to believe that his allegiance lies elsewhere.” (AX E).    
Indonesia  2
Indonesia is a multi-party republic with approximately 245 million people.
For the first time in 2004, the citizens directly elected their president, in elections
that international observers determined were free and fair. Although the government
has been unable to address serious human rights abuses in the past, legislation
signed in 2005 has continued to yield significant legal and judicial improvements for
the nation, including the expansion of rights for a free press. Due to possibility of
terrorist attacks directed at Americans or Westerns at any time in the country, the
U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning concerning the security situation
in Indonesia.
Japan
 
Japan is a stable parliamentary democracy with a generally good human rights
record. It has been a strong ally of the United States since post-World War II.  The
two countries share military alliances and economic partnerships.  It has offered the
United States extensive support in the war on terror.  More recently, it launched an
intelligence-gathering satellite and intends to establish an intelligence office in
Washington, D.C. for purposes of sharing information with the U.S. Japan was listed
in 2000 as an active collector of economic and proprietary information.
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge
must consider the “Adjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to
Classified Information” (Guidelines), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In
addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative
guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions
(MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified
information.
These guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing
the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these
guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.
Guideline ¶ 2. An administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,
impartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole person concept,” an
administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline
¶ 2(c).
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative
process factors listed at Guideline ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential
for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation
or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,
the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny
doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information
will be resolved in favor of national security.” Guideline ¶ 2(b). In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all3
the contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “This is something less
than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding
from being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,
380  (4  Cir . 1994) .t h
“The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and4
current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under
D irective  ¶ E3 .1 .15 .”   ISCR Case  N o. 04-10340  at 2  (App. B d . Ju ly 6 , 2006). 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial
evidence.”  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to3
establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access
to classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of
a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and
prove a mitigating condition. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 provides, “The applicant is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and
[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable
clearance decision.” The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to
the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty
hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the Government must be able
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants
access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by
necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance,
loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Foreign Influence
Guideline ¶ 6 explains the Government’s concern about “foreign contacts and
interests” stating, “if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial
interests, [he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,
organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to
pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can
and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact
or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as
whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain
protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.”

After the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying
condition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a
mitigating condition. Two Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline
¶ 8 are potentially applicable:

Given Applicant’s assertion that he has terminated the relationship with the Indonesian woman, “it is unlikely [he]
will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [the woman] and the interests of the U.S.” Another
relevant factor in determining potential foreign influence is the nature of the government of the country in question. The
woman now resides in Japan, a strong military and economic ally of the United States. It has a good human rights record and is
less likely to exert coercion on its citizens and residents. He is no longer in contact with her, which is sufficient to meet his
burden of showing there is “little likelihood that [his relationship with her] could create a risk for foreign influence or
exploitation.”  Both conditions warrant application.

to the whole person concept under Directive ¶ E2.2.1. “Under the whole person
concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an
applicant’s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate
an applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s
conduct and circumstances.”  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors5
(APF) which are used for “whole person” analysis.  Because foreign influence does
not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior
changes, etc., the eighth APF, “the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress,” Directive ¶ E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this
adjudication.  In addition to the eighth APF, other “[a]vailable, reliable information6
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered
in reaching a determination.”  Directive ¶ E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision
is “an overall common sense determination.”  Directive ¶ E2.2.3.    
The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address “evidence of an
applicant’s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant’s family’s ties to
the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties
within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.” ISCR Case No.
04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  
Substantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant’s security
clearance. Applicant was born and educated in the United States. He has family
living here. He, along with several family members, has served in the U.S. military.
In January 2007, he returned home to reside and work. He would like his children to
live here in the future. He has no intention of returning to Japan to reside. He
terminated his relationship with the Indonesian woman earlier this year, and
understands the complications that it created in his personal and professional life.
He disclosed the relationship to his wife and father. His colleagues know that his
security clearance has been detained due to a foreign relationship.  He is willing to
further disclose the relationship to his employer if necessary. These disclosures
diminish the potential for coercion by Japan. There is no evidence Applicant has
ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He
testified credibly that he takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he has

worked diligently for a defense contractor for eleven years. His colleagues assess
him as loyal and trustworthy. 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the
security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. The evidence leaves me with no
doubts as to Applicant’s security eligibility and suitability.  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”7
and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the
Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the
Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the Government’s case. For the
reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the
SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
