DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 17, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On March 4, 2014, Applicant 
 
2 
 
 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was initially assigned to another 
administrative judge on April 29, 2014, and was reassigned to me on May 19, 2014. On 
June 4, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of 
Hearing scheduling the hearing for June 24, 2014. The hearing was held as scheduled. 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, 
while Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. Prehearing 
guidance sent to Applicant was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The record of the 
proceeding was left open until July 8, 2014, to provide Applicant an opportunity to 
present additional matters. He submitted no additional matters. All proffered exhibits 
were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was 
received on July 7, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old aircraft mechanic who works for a defense contractor. 
He has been working in his current job since December 1999. He graduated from high 
school in 1979 and served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1979 to 1983. 
He has been married for the past 18 years. He has three children, ages 13, 17, and 25, 
and one stepchild who is 37 years old. His two youngest children live with him and his 
wife. He has held a security clearance without incident since about 2000.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 17 delinquent debts totaling $32,546 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a – 1.q). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR ¶ 1.b, 1.c, 
1.d, 1.e, and 1.o and indicated those debts were a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.h. He did not 
specifically admit or deny the remaining debts and his comments regarding those debts 
are considered denials. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Each of the 
alleged debts is reflected in a credit report that was admitted into evidence.2 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job twice. In early 
2007, she was working as a respiratory therapist and earning about $55,000 annually. 
In 2007, she was laid off from her job and was unemployed for a couple of weeks. In her 
next job, she also worked as a respiratory therapist; but earned about $20,000 less a 
year. She again lost her job in February 2013 and remained unemployed until about 
three months before the hearing. She is now employed part time and earns about half of 
what she received before her latest layoff. Applicant was not sure whether his wife 
would have the opportunity to return to full-time employment in her current job. He also 
testified that his wife had medical problems that resulted in some of the medical debts 
discussed below.3  
 
                                                          
1 Tr. 6, 28-31, 50-51; GE 1, 2.  Applicant has been working in the same job for the past 21 years, 
including 8 years working for a subcontractor and the last 13 years as a direct-hire employee.

SOR ¶ 1.a – judgment filed in August 2011 for $3,383. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant indicated that he was unaware of the nature of this debt. At the hearing, he 
testified that he received a notice in the mail that he was being sued, but did not appear 
in court. He acknowledged this was a default judgment and stated that he has not paid 
this judgment. He also indicated that he has not gone to the courthouse in an attempt to 
identify the original creditor of this debt.4 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.o – medical debts placed for collection for 
$250, $1,065, $123, $50, $1,425, and $100, respectively. At the beginning of the 
hearing, Department Counsel noted that the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,425) was a 
duplicate and consolidation of the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.o. 
Consequently, I find in favor of Applicant on the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 
1.e, and 1.o. Applicant testified that these medical debts were probably copays or other 
amounts not covered by his medical insurance. These debts were placed for collection 
between January 2009 and December 2011. He indicated that he and his wife tried to 
set up a payment plan for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h in December 2013, but a 
representative of the creditor said they would not accept any payment less than $380 
per month, which Applicant could not afford to pay. At the time of the hearing, he had 
not made any payments on that debt, but indicated that he had been making payments 
on other medical bills.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $1,296. This was a cell phone account. It was 
placed for collection in January 2013. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that 
he contacted the creditor and was told that he does not owe anything on this bill. He 
testified that he previously had a cell phone account with the alleged creditor that was 
terminated about two or three years ago. He also indicated that he has an Internet 
service account with the alleged creditor and that account was current. He provided no 
documentation corroborating his testimony or showing that he disputed this debt.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – medical debt placed for collection for $159. This debt was placed for 
collection in April 2011. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he did not 
know whether he owed this debt and that he was unsuccessful in his attempts to find 
information about it. No document was presented to show this debt was resolved or 
disputed.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i – collection account for $804. This was another cell phone account. It 
was placed for collection in June 2009. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that 
this debt had been paid. He indicated that he was made payments of $25 per month to

resolve it. At the hearing, Department Counsel asked him if he could provide 
documentation showing it was paid, and Applicant stated he could submit that 
documentation. However, no documentation was provided.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j – collection account for $3,435. This was a credit card account that 
had a date of last activity of October 2011. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed 
that this debt was a duplicate of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.p. Sufficient evidence, 
however, was not presented to conclude that those debts were duplicates. He testified 
that he had not paid this debt.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k – collection account for $4,399. This was a credit card account that 
had a date of first delinquency/date of last activity of November 2007. No evidence was 
presented to show this debt was resolved.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l – collection account for $1,706. This is a credit card account that had a 
date of first delinquency/date of last activity of August 2009. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant indicated that he tried to find information about the collection agency and this 
debt, but was not able to find anything. He indicated that he could not confirm that he 
owed this debt.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m – home mortgage loan 30 day past due for $4,231. Applicant 
acquired this home for about $133,000 in August 2001. He first put down about $10,000 
in cash to purchase the land before building the home. In 2006, he refinanced the home 
and added about $60,000 in improvements. This refinancing raised the mortgage loan 
to $212,000. The term of the refinanced mortgage was 20 years, but Applicant began 
making regular bimonthly payments of $1,150 in an attempt to pay it off in 17 years. 
After his wife was laid off in February 2013, he defaulted on the mortgage payments. At 
the time of the hearing, he had not made any mortgage payments since March 2013, 
was behind about $28,000 on those payments, and was facing a foreclosure action. On 
June 4, 2014, the mortgage servicer offered Applicant a Trial Modification Plan in which 
he would be required to make three payments of $1,668 in July, August, and September 
2014 to forbear the foreclosure proceeding and convert the trial plan into a permanent 
mortgage modification. No documentation was presented to show that Applicant made 
the first payment under the trial plan.12

SOR ¶ 1.n – repossessed automobile account past due for $5,607. According to 
a credit report dated November 2011, this vehicle loan was opened in August 2005 and 
had a last reported delinquency in September 2011. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant stated that he paid this debt and provided a copy of the vehicle’s title 
indicating the lien was released on January 2012. He used a tax refund to recover the 
repossessed vehicle and pay off the loan. This debt has been resolved.13 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p – charged-off account for $2,819.  This was a credit card account that 
had a date of last activity of November 2007. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
indicated that this account was charged off and closed with a zero balance. He testified 
that he had not made any payments on this debt.14 
 
SOR ¶ 1.q – collection account for $1,694.  This was a credit card account that 
was placed for collection in February 2011. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
provided documentation showing this was charged off and closed with a zero balance. 
He testified this debt remained unresolved.15 
 
Applicant’s annual salary, including overtime, totals about $74,000. In responding 
to interrogatories in July 2013, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement 
(PFS) that indicated his net monthly income was $5,378, his total monthly expenses 
were $4,735, and his total debt payments were $2,200, which left him a net monthly 
remainder of $643. The total debt payments listed only his monthly mortgage payment 
and did not include payments toward the alleged debts. Applicant testified that he has 
not obtained financial counseling. At the time of the hearing, Applicant indicated he had 
about $2,000 to $2,500 in his bank account. He also stated that he has twice withdrawn 
money totaling about $30,000 from his 401(k) account and is paying back those loans. 
He failed to file his 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns on time because he 
believed he would only receive a couple of hundred dollars as refunds. He filed those 
late income tax returns in about 2011.16 
 
Applicant completed his entire enlistment in the Marine Corps and received an 
honorable discharge. In the military, he received a Good Conduct Medal and an 
Overseas Service Ribbon.17

alleged conduct, however, may be considered to assess an applicant’s credibility; to decide whether a 
particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of 
the whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
 
7 
 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unwilling or unable to satisfy 
for an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
8 
 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s wife was laid off twice. Shortly after the first layoff in 2007, she 
obtained a new job earning about $20,000 less per year. She was laid off again in early 
2013 and recently obtained only part-time employment. She has also encountered 
medical problems. His wife’s unemployment, underemployment, and medical problems 
were conditions beyond Applicant’s control that contributed to his financial problems. 
Nonetheless, Applicant failed to show that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances in addressing his delinquent debts. Some of his debts have been 
delinquent for years. He only presented proof that he paid one debt (SOR ¶ 1.n). From 
the evidence presented, I cannot find that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control, are being resolved, or are unlikely to recur. On the contrary, his delinquent 
debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to the debt he 
paid. AG 20(e) applies to the duplicate debts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
 
9 
 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant served in the Marine Corps and received an honorable discharge. He 
has held a security clearance without incident for a number of years. However, he 
provided little evidence to mitigate the financial concerns raised in the SOR. He has 
paid one debt, but has not taken any meaningful action to resolve the other debts. His 
financial problems remain a security concern.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security 
concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.b – 1e:  For Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.f – 1.m:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.n – 1o:  For Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.p – 1q:  Against Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
