Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. A 69-year-old linguist, Applicant has a history
of financial problems that are no longer a concern. In 2010–2011, he was charged with
the fourth-degree sexual assault of an employee of his fast-food franchise, and he has
not provided reliable documentary evidence showing the disposition of the criminal
conduct. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the criminal
conduct security concern. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On December 6, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations
and Guideline J for criminal conduct.  
The case was assigned to me April 11, 2014, to conduct a hearing requested by
Applicant. The hearing was held May 27, 2014. At the hearing, Department Counsel
presented Exhibits 1–8, which were admitted. Likewise, Applicant presented Exhibits
A–H, which were admitted. Applicant as well as his 26-year-old son testified. The
transcript (Tr.) was received June 5, 2014.
Post-hearing Matters
The record was kept open to allow Applicant an opportunity to present additional
documentary matters. On the day after the hearing, May 28, Applicant’s son delivered
documentary matters mentioned during the hearing but for which copies were not then
available. Those matters are admitted as Exhibits I and J. 
Additional time was granted to obtain and present documentation concerning the
disposition or final outcome of the fourth-degree sexual assault charge against
Applicant in 2010–2011. On June 20, 2014, more than three weeks after the hearing,
neither I nor Department Counsel had heard from Applicant or his son, who was
assisting him with these matters. Accordingly, I sent a last-chance letter with a July 15,
2014 deadline to submit additional matters.  The letter was delivered June 23, 2014.  To2 3
date, there was no response to the June 20, 2014 last-chance letter. 
  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 69-year-old employee of a federal contractor. A native of
Afghanistan, he came to the United States in 1996 for a business trip and sought
political asylum, which was granted in 1997.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in4
2011.  He is employed as a linguist working in support of the U.S. military in5
Afghanistan. He has held this job since mid-2013. He has a good record of employment

with his current employer as shown by several letters of recommendation and four
certificates of appreciation, merit, or achievement.6
The SOR alleges and there is substantial evidence to show that Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of: (1) four collection or charged-off
accounts for a total of approximately $6,194; (2) unpaid business taxes of approximately
$5,784; and (3) unpaid rent of approximately $9,746, which resulted in the landlord
suing for nonpayment of the debt. The unpaid business taxes and rent stem from
Applicant’s period of self-employment when he owned and managed a fast-food
franchise.  
The four collection or charged-off accounts are resolved. Applicant presented
testimony and documentary evidence that in January 2014 those accounts were settled
for lesser amounts totaling about $2,930.7
The unpaid business taxes of $5,784 for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012 are
largely unresolved.  Applicant or his son have been in contact with the relevant tax8
office.  In March 2014, a $400 payment was made for tax year 2010, which now has a9
balance due of about $746.  For the balances owed for 2011 and 2012 (and potentially10
2013), the plan is to address them when additional income becomes available. 
The unpaid rent of approximately $9,746 and the resulting lawsuit are the fallout
from the failure of Applicant’s fast-food franchise.  The landlord locked the store’s door11
and evicted the tenant in September 2013. A lawsuit for nonpayment of rent was
brought, but there is no documentary evidence showing that the lawsuit ended in a
judgment, dismissal, or some other disposition. 
Before his business failed, in about January 2010, Applicant was charged with
the fourth-degree sexual assault of a female employee of his fast-food franchise.12
Applicant testified that the charge stemmed from a misunderstanding of his minor
physical contact (a tap on the shoulder) with the employee.  He also testified that in13
2011 he was found guilty of the offense, paid a fine, and was required to undergo a

documentary information concerning the criminal case. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As15
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt16
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An17
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  18
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting19
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An20
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate21
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme22
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.23

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.24
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it25
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant26
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline27
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  28
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.

There is substantial evidence that Applicant has a history of financial problems or
difficulties. His unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy
debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more than29 30
sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. With that said, Applicant is able
to overcome those matters because: (1) he made a good-faith effort to resolve the four
consumer debts by settling them for lesser amounts; and (2) the unpaid business taxes
and unpaid rent are both related to a business failure, which was a circumstance largely
beyond Applicant’s control and unlikely to recur in the future. For these reasons,
Applicant’s history of financial problems are no longer a concern.  
But the criminal conduct is another matter. The fourth-degree sexual assault
charge against Applicant is disqualifying under Guideline J for criminal conduct.31
Without reliable documentary evidence to support his explanation, I cannot conclude
that the incident was minor or caused by a misunderstanding. It seems rather odd or
unlikely that Applicant was convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault based on a mere
tap on the shoulder of a female employee. And it should be obvious, but it is
nonetheless stated here, that an applicant who is unwilling or unable to produce and
present relevant documentation concerning a criminal charge is not a good candidate
for a security clearance. For these reasons, Applicant’s history of criminal conduct
cannot be mitigated and it remains a legitimate concern.  
Applicant’s history of criminal conduct raises doubt about his judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve that
doubt in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.  In doing so, I considered Applicant’s good employment record while working32
in a combat zone in support of the U.S. military. Nonetheless, the favorable matters are
not enough to justify a conclusion that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to
obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: For Applicant
7
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
