MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant defaulted on about $31,467 in consumer credit obligations for which he 
was legally liable between late 2007 and early 2008. Another $765 in consumer credit debt 
was referred for collection on an account on which he was an authorized user. His financial 
delinquencies are attributed to the economic downturn, which negatively affected his and 
his spouse’s business. As of June 2014, he had made no payments toward resolving his 
past-due debt. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 20, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and explaining why it was unable 
to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance. The DOD CAF took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Applicant answered the SOR allegations on April 9, 2014, and he requested a 
hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On 
May 15, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
him. On May 27, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for June 18, 2014.  
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled.
1
 Five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) and one 
Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted without objection. Applicant also testified as 
reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 27, 2014. 
 
Procedural Rulings 
 
 When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he submitted a character reference 
from February 2007. The issue of its admissibility was not raised at the hearing by 
Department Counsel or Applicant. At my request, Department Counsel confirmed on July 
21, 2014, that he had no objection to its admission. Accordingly, the document was marked 
and entered into evidence as AE B.  
  
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of March 20, 2014, Applicant owed 
$38,062 on five past-due accounts that had been charged off (SOR 1.a) or placed for 
collection (SOR 1.b-1.e). When he answered the SOR, he admitted the debts without 
explanation. His admissions to the delinquencies are accepted and incorporated as 
findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the 
following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 62-year-old forklift operator, who started his defense contractor 
employment in November 2002. (GE 1; Tr. 21.) Applicant has held a DOD Secret 
clearance since October 2004. (GE 1.) He recently accepted an offer to retire effective 
June 30, 2014. (Tr. 31.) 
 
Applicant has two adult sons from his first marriage. In May 1990, he married his 
current spouse. They have two teenage sons (ages 15 and 16) living at home. Applicant’s 
spouse has four adult children from her previous marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 21-22.)  
 
Applicant was employed as a laborer and truck driver for his hometown from August 
1987 until November 2002, when he began working for his current employer. (GE 2.) In 
June 2002, Applicant and his spouse bought a home, taking on a conventional 30-year 
mortgage of $130,860, with initial monthly payments at $1,236 per month. (GEs 2, 5.) 
 
Applicant completed and executed his initial application for a DOD Secret clearance 
on October 16, 2002. Applicant responded “Yes” to whether a lien had been placed against 
                                                 
1 
Before the introduction of any evidence at the hearing, Applicant indicated that he was retiring from his 
defense contractor employment as of June 30, 2014. Jurisdiction was established because he was still 
employed by a DOD contractor with an active security clearance as of the date of his hearing. (Tr. 8.) 
 
 3 
his property in the last seven years, disclosing a $2,000 tax lien issued by his town in June 
2002. In response to any financial delinquencies over 90 days, Applicant reported a $1,740 
utility debt from June 2001. (GE 2.) 
 
As of August 12, 2003, Applicant had five revolving charge accounts on his credit 
record which were rated as bad debts. Three individual accounts, with respective balances 
of $620, $1,734, and $976 had been written off to profit and loss in May 2000. A joint 
account opened in January 1997 had been written off in the amount of $1,508 in March 
1998. A $1,602 delinquent balance on an individual account was placed for collection. As 
of October 2002, Applicant owed a past-due balance of $1,918. In addition, a dentist had 
placed a $439 debt for collection around October 2002 that was unpaid. Applicant’s 
mortgage payment was 60 days past due ($2,472) on a loan balance of $130,400. His 
credit record also showed several tax liens filed against him which had been released, but 
also a $1,591 lien from June 1998 with no indication that it had been satisfied. (GE 5.) 
Despite these outstanding delinquencies, Applicant was apparently granted a Secret 
clearance in October 2004. (GE 1.) 
 
In February 2005, Applicant’s mortgage was paid off. In May 2006, Applicant took 
on joint liability for a new mortgage of $208,500, to be repaid at $1,641 per month. In 2005 
or 2006, Applicant started a business with his spouse because she had no success finding 
work. They bought and sold ornamental weaponry. (Tr. 23.) Around that same time, his 
spouse was diagnosed with a medical condition requiring ongoing medication 
management. (Tr. 25, 33, 35.) 
 
 The downturn in the economy began to affect Applicant and his spouse’s weaponry 
business around 2007. Applicant opened some consumer credit card accounts to pay bills. 
(Tr. 23.) Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on those accounts and on their 
mortgage. They surrendered possession of the property to their mortgage lender around 
February 2008 and moved into a rented unit at $1,300 per month, including heat. (GE 1; 
Tr. 26, 41.) The lender agreed to a short sale of the property to resolve his defaulted 
mortgage (Tr. 36), but five consumer credit accounts were charged off or placed for 
collection or both, as set forth in the following table.

 After his credit card accounts became seriously delinquent, Applicant sought the 
assistance of a credit counselor. The credit counselor contacted Applicant’s lenders. 
According to Applicant, the accounts had been charged off, so there was nothing he could 
do to address them. (Tr. 26, 30.) 
 
 Facing a rental increase of almost $200 a month, Applicant and his family moved to 
a “basic rat hole” at rent of $850 a month. Around February 2012, they moved to their 
current residence at a rent of $1,100 a month. (GE 1; Tr. 37, 41-42.) Applicant did not 
notify his old creditors of his new addresses, but he filed change of address forms with the 
post office on each move. (Tr. 40.) To Applicant’s knowledge, he has received no collection 
letters from his creditors. (Tr. 36.) 
 
On August 2, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronics Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant responded “Yes” 
to delinquencies involving routine accounts in the last seven years. He disclosed his 
mortgage default; the five debts alleged in the SOR (1.a as $28,804, 1.b as $639, 1.c, 1.d 
as $1,014, and 1.e as $435); and a $758 debt not in the SOR.
2
 Applicant attributed his 
delinquencies to the economy, and he indicated that the credit card debts had all been 
charged off. Regarding any efforts to satisfy these past-due accounts, Applicant stated, 
“CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING [location omitted] COULD NOT HELP ALL ITEMS 
WERE CLOSED OR CHARGED OFF.” (GE 1.) A check of Applicant’s credit on August 21, 
2013, showed no additional delinquencies. (GE 4.) 
 
                                                 
2 
On his August 21, 2013 credit report, Applicant is listed as an authorized user on the account in SOR 1.c and 
on the past-due account not alleged. (GE 4.) 
 
 5 
As of May 13, 2014, Equifax Information Services was reporting balances totaling 
$3,668 in collection (SOR 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e). The debts in SOR 1.a and 1.c were not on his 
latest credit record. (GE 3.) 
 
As of mid-June 2014, Applicant had taken no steps to address his known past-due 
debts because he didn’t know what he could do. All of the creditors contacted through the 
credit counselor around 2008 had indicated they had no information about the accounts 
because they had been charged off (“So it’s kind of like a catch-22 that we were hung out 
to dry.”). (Tr. 26-27.)  
 
 Applicant’s spouse handles the family’s finances. To Applicant’s knowledge, they 
have not been late in paying their rent or utilities in the last two years. (Tr. 27.) Applicant 
also owes no delinquent state or federal income taxes. He received a federal tax refund for 
tax year 2013, although he does not recall the amount of his refund or if it was spent. (Tr. 
28.) Applicant and his spouse live from week-to-week on his take-home pay of about $640 
a week. (Tr. 37, 43.) His spouse has not worked outside the home since she was 
diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition around 2005 or 2006. (Tr. 25, 33, 37.) 
Applicant pays approximately $100 to $120 out-of-pocket for his and his spouse’s 
prescriptions each month. (Tr. 35.) 
 
Applicant filed the paperwork to retire at the end of June 2014. His employer offered 
an incentive of three years of continued insurance coverage or a $25,000 lump-sum 
payment subject to taxes. He chose the latter because he was told that with two teens at 
home, he would qualify for insurance at a lower rate. (Tr. 31-33.) Based on available social 
security records, Applicant is entitled to a monthly social security retirement benefit of 
$1,448 per month beginning July 2014. (AE A.) Applicant testified that his two teenage 
sons are also eligible for social security benefits at $724.25 each per month. (Tr. 43.) 
Applicant testified that he also qualifies for a pension from the defense contractor (Tr. 31), 
but no information was presented about the amount of his pension. 
 
In February 2007, a department supervisor at work attested to Applicant being a 
“super hard worker” with a positive attitude. He recommended Applicant for his dedication 
and prompt service as a fork-lift driver. (AE B.) Applicant has had some minor infractions at 
work unrelated to security. (GE 1; Tr. 30.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
 
 6 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns about financial considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The SOR alleges $38,062 of delinquent debt on five accounts which had been 
charged off or placed for collection or both. Applicant admitted the debts, although as an 
authorized user only, his legal liability for repaying the $756 credit card debt (SOR 1.c) was 
not established. Likely due to interest on unpaid balances totaling $31,467 (SOR 1.a-1b 
and 1.d-1.e), Applicant’s delinquent debt accrued to about $37,393 on the four accounts 
for which he had legal liability. Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” 
 
 7 
apply. The evidence also shows that he and his spouse lost their home in 2008, after they 
stopped paying their mortgage. While Applicant’s mortgage default was resolved through a 
short sale, the mortgage default shows that his financial problems were more extensive 
than alleged in the SOR.
3
 
 
Concerning the mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long 
ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment,” applies in that the accounts in the SOR were all opened in 2007 and became 
delinquent shortly thereafter. There is no evidence of any new delinquencies. Even so, it is 
difficult to conclude that the behavior is not likely to recur. Five accounts were rated as bad 
debts on his credit record in August 2003. These delinquencies did not prevent him from 
obtaining his security clearance in October 2004, but they too raise questions about his 
ability to manage his credit responsibly. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” is partially implicated. Applicant attributes the financial difficulties 
that arose in 2007 to the economic downturn and consequent loss of income from his and 
his spouse’s retail business. Applicant presented little evidence to show that he made 
sound financial decisions, either to minimize their business losses or to address his 
legitimate financial obligations. What can be gleaned from the evidentiary record is that 
Applicant and his spouse opened a joint line of credit in July 2006 of $19,528, which was 
paid through a new line of credit in January 2007 (SOR 1.a). After there had been no 
activity on the new account since January 2008, a $28,804 balance was charged off in 
February 2009. He incurred $639 in charges on the credit card account in SOR 1.b, $309 
over the account’s credit limit, between August and December 2007. Similarly, he opened 
the credit card accounts in SOR 1.d and 1.e during the summer of 2007. In less than one 
year, he owed collection balances exceeding his $750 and $500 credit limits. This account 
history could be explained by a precipitous loss of business income, although he presented 
no corroborating documentation. Given he and his spouse lost not only the business but 
also their home during the economic downturn, Applicant and his spouse may well have 
overextended themselves financially in an effort to start the business. 
 
Applicant acted responsibly by seeking the assistance of a credit counselor after his 
consumer credit debts became seriously delinquent. Applicant testified that before he and 
his spouse “lost everything,” they sat with a credit counselor who called all of their 
creditors. The creditors were unable to provide information because the accounts had been 
charged off. Applicant testified that there was nothing he could do to resolve the debts. 
                                                 
3 
The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). The mortgage and his older delinquencies cannot 
provide a separate basis for disqualification since they were not alleged in the SOR, but they are relevant to 
assessing Applicant’s financial judgment generally and the risk of recurrence. 
 
 8 
Available credit reports show that the credit card debts were placed for collection. (GEs 3, 
4.) Applicant understood as of his August 2013 e-QIP that the accounts alleged in the SOR 
had been “closed or charged off.” To his knowledge, he received no collection notices. 
However, because his spouse handles the finances, this does not necessarily mean that 
no collection notices were received. In April 2014, Applicant received the SOR indicating 
that the debts in SOR 1.b-1.e were reportedly in collection, and that the DOD was 
concerned about them. Yet he made no effort to investigate the debts. (Tr. 30.) Applicant 
may have already decided to file for retirement (“This had nothing to do with me retiring 
because this stuff was started—the filing for retirement—before I got the paperwork.”), but 
it does not eliminate his obligation to his creditors. AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate the 
security concerns that arise from his inaction toward his past-due debts over the past five 
years. Had he obtained his credit report, he would have learned that his credit card debts 
had been transferred or purchased and were held by the creditors identified in the SOR. 
 
Neither AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control,” nor AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” apply without some recent efforts on his part to 
address the debts of concern to the DOD. He testified that he would pay his debts if he 
knew to whom to pay them. (Tr. 38.) A promise to pay is not a substitute for a 
demonstrated track record of repayment. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies only to the debt in SOR 1.c. Applicant is listed as an authorized user on that 
account on his August 2013 credit report, and the debt does not appear on his May 2014 
credit report. Equifax dropped the line of credit debt in SOR 1.a from his credit record. The 
debt has been written off by the creditor, and there is no indication that he is being pursued 
for the balance. Even so, his handling of that accounts continues to raise concerns of 
financial irresponsibility. The financial concerns raised by his record of delinquent accounts 
are not fully mitigated under Guideline F. 
 
Whole-Person Concept  
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
4
 
                                                 
4
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 
 9 
Applicant and his spouse started a retail business shortly before an economic 
downturn that brought on financial stress. Applicant and his spouse took on a sizeable line 
of credit debt, and he opened some consumer credit card accounts in his name to pay bills. 
He was responsible in seeking the help of a credit counselor, although apparently only after 
his consumer credit debts had become seriously delinquent. When the credit counselor 
was unable to obtain any information about the debts, Applicant did not pursue the matter 
further. Applicant is not required to resolve all of his delinquent debts before he can be 
granted security clearance eligibility. Even so, the DOHA Appeal Board has required that 
an applicant demonstrate that he has a realistic plan established to resolve his financial 
problems and that he has taken significant actions to implement that plan. See ISCR Case 
No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Applicant’s 
candor about his debts on his e-QIP weighs in his favor. At the same time, it is well settled 
that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a 
strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. 
Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990.). For the reasons noted above, based on the 
facts before me and the adjudicative guidelines that I am required to consider, I am unable 
to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
