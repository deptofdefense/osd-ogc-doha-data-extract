Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant had some financial difficulties because of his divorce, a series of serious 
medical setbacks between 2010 and 2012, and a year of unemployment. As of March 2014, 
he owed approximately $24,355 of delinquent debt, which he has only recently started to 
address. More progress is needed toward reducing his delinquency before I can conclude 
that his financial problems are behind him. Clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On March 25, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
 2 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on April 21, 2014, and he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On May 15, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On May 27, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for June 17, 
2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and 15 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-O) were admitted into evidence, GEs 1 and 4 over Applicant’s 
objections. Applicant objected to the authenticity and factual accuracy of GE 1, Applicant’s 
security clearance application. I admitted the document on Applicant’s attestation that he 
signed it.
1
 In response to Applicant’s expressed concerns about GE 4 as initially marked, 
the Government submitted a redacted version, to which Applicant did not object. A chart 
prepared by Department Counsel was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) and considered 
argument. Applicant and a union representative testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) 
received on June 27, 2014. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of March 25, 2014, Applicant owed 
$29,030 in delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.u). Nine of the 21 alleged debts totaling $3,503 
were owed to unidentified medical creditors (SOR 1.f-1.n). When he answered the SOR 
allegations, Applicant denied five of the 21 alleged debts:  a $1,389 judgment debt (SOR 
1.a) because it had been satisfied; a $917 consumer credit debt (SOR 1.b) because it was 
his ex-wife’s obligation in their divorce decree; a $4,861 credit card debt in collection (SOR 
1.e); a $94 debt in collection (SOR 1.p) because it had been paid; and a $772 revolving 
charge debt in collection (SOR 1.t).  Applicant admitted the remaining 16 debts, which he 
attributed to his divorce and to his serious medical issues between 2010 and 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old high school graduate with some technical training. He 
married his first wife in the early 1980s. They had a son and daughter before they divorced. 
In July 2008, Applicant and his second wife were divorced after 10 years of marriage. They 
had no children together. (GE 1; AE E; Tr. 43.) When they divorced, Applicant’s ex-wife 
accepted repayment responsibility for the debts in her name, as well as one joint debt 
(SOR 1.b, 1.t same debt). Applicant was not required to pay alimony because his ex-wife 
was self-supporting. (AE E.)  
 
                                                 
1 
Applicant’s objection to the accuracy of him being identified on the form as a blonde, blue-eyed female 5”7” in 
height was valid. These concerns went to the weight afforded the information. The form was accurate as to 
Applicant’s name, social security number, and employment, etc., and Applicant signed it. 
 
 3 
Applicant worked as an outside electrician for his current employer, a defense 
contractor, from April 1983 to July 1997, when he was laid off during a reduction-in-force. 
(GE 1.) He held a “green badge” or Secret security clearance for most of the 14 years and 
was promoted through the ranks from “the very bottom, actually six[th] step . . . to first 
class.” (GE 1; Tr. 44-48.) At the time of his layoff, Applicant’s hourly wage was $22. (Tr. 
48.) 
 
After six months of training in the telecommunications field (Tr. 49), Applicant went 
to work in the cable television/Internet industry as a telecommunications technician around 
December 1997. (GE 1.). He worked for one company for three years before switching 
employers. (Tr. 50.) In 2010, Applicant began experiencing a succession of medical 
problems, which led him to lose time for treatment and recuperation. He was out of work 
for three to four months following surgery in May 2010. A medical problem detected during 
a follow-up examination a year later led to another three to four months of medical leave. 
Complications from his treatment for that illness led to another six weeks of medical leave 
in 2012.
2
 (GE 4.) Applicant received temporary disability pay “at the highest percentage” 
during his lengthy medical absences, but at $468 a week, it was less than his full wage, 
which rose to $29.00 an hour in 2012. (Tr. 51-53, 133-135.) 
 
Applicant had medical insurance that did not cover the entire cost of his various 
treatments. (AE B; Tr. 54.) Available medical records show that Applicant incurred charges 
totaling approximately $32,816 at a local hospital between March 29, 2010, and February 
26, 2012. After insurance payments and adjustments, Applicant was billed a total of 
$3,729.74 by the hospital on the charges. (AEs B, N.) 
 
The week he returned to work from his medical leave in July 2012, Applicant was 
involuntarily terminated because of alleged falsification of his time sheet, which Applicant 
disputes.
3
 (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 60-62, 120-121.)  Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He 
                                                 
2 
Available information is insufficient to determine with specificity the dates of his medical leave. Applicant 
testified that he was out of work for six months following his first operation. The following year, a serious health 
problem was detected during an x-ray, which required surgery and led to “another six months or maybe less” 
of lost time. From that second operation, he received an infection that required daily antibiotic treatments at a 
local hospital for eight or nine weeks. He indicated he was out of work “three or four months, maybe.” (Tr. 51-
53.) When he returned to work from medical leave, he was fired for “a misunderstanding.” The company 
claimed that he falsified his time sheet. He initially testified that his last day of work was in June or July 2010. 
(Tr. 60-61.) Applicant discrepantly indicated on his e-QIP that he was fired in July 2012, which is consistent 
with his account during his September 2013 subject interview. He indicated then that he took medical leaves 
of three to four months from the company in 2010 and in 2011, and of about six weeks in 2012. (GE 4.)  The 
hospital records in evidence show laboratory work on March 29, 2010; an ultrasound and blood workup on 
April 7, 2010, a one-day inpatient stay for testing April 16-17, 2010, a MRI scan on April 22, 2010, and minor 
surgery during an inpatient stay May 3-7, 2010.  Hospital records of care provided in 2011 are limited and 
show laboratory work on February 12, 2011, and March 1, 2011. Applicant had lab work on January 31, 2012; 
lab work, an x-ray, and an MRI on February 8, 2012; and an x-ray on February 26, 2012. The records also 
show total charges of $5,328 on February 15, 2012, but do not include the nature of the treatment. (AEs B, N.) 
 
3
 There is no SOR allegation concerning his termination from his employment. No negative inference is drawn 
from the termination. It is mentioned because it had a negative impact on his finances. The DOHA Appeal 
Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to assess an applicant’s 
credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to 
 
 4 
collected unemployment compensation of $14,000 (Tr. 136-137), which the 
telecommunications company challenged unsuccessfully. (Tr. 62-63.) In mid-July 2013, 
Applicant began working for his defense contractor employer. (GE 1; Tr. 64.) 
 
 On August 13, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant responded “Yes” 
to the inquiry concerning delinquencies involving routine accounts in the last seven years. 
He disclosed two past-due credit card debts of $5,000 each (SOR 1.e and 1.q) and a $900 
credit card debt (SOR 1.b, duplicated in SOR 1.t)
4
 that were still outstanding. Applicant 
indicated that he would make repayment arrangements on the $5,000 debts once he could 
confirm the creditors. He indicated (and AE E confirms) that the debt in SOR 1.b was his 
ex-wife’s responsibility. Applicant explained that he was looking into paying off the debts, 
which were incurred because of his divorce, his medical problems, and his unemployment 
of over a year. (GE 1.) 
 
 As of August 30, 2013, Applicant’s credit record showed that the three delinquent 
debts he listed on his e-QIP were no longer held by the original creditors but were in 
collection. In addition, a $1,389 judgment had been filed against him in September 2012 
(SOR 1.a); 14 medical debts totaling $4,080 (SOR 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.p, and a $221 debt not 
alleged) were in collection; and two previously undisclosed credit card debts, of $3,789 
(SOR 1.r, duplicated in 1.s) and $4,694 (SOR 1.u), were in collection. The medical debts 
were placed for collection between October 2010 and June 2013. The five credit card 
accounts in collection were placed with their current account holders in March 2011 (SOR 
1.b), June 2012 (SOR 1.c), April 2011 (SOR 1.q), in February 2012 (SOR 1.r), and in or 
before August 2013 (SOR 1.u). Applicant’s credit report also showed that his mortgage 
lender had initiated foreclosure proceedings in February 2013 because he was seriously 
delinquent in his payments, but Applicant brought the loan current. (GE 3.) Applicant has 
not been late in paying his $1,669 monthly mortgage obligation since he started with his 
employer in July 2013. (Tr. 123.) 
 
 On September 3, 2013, Applicant obtained his credit report from Trans Union, which 
showed the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, including the judgment in SOR 1.a. 
Identified by name were the health care providers that had referred past-due balances for 
collection. The medical debts in SOR 1.c and 1.d were placed by two different radiologists, 
albeit on the same date in September 2012. The medical debts in SOR 1.f-1.n were shown 
as having been placed by the hospital where he was treated from 2010 to 2012. The 
medical debt in SOR 1.o was owed to a physical therapist. (AE O.) 
                                                                                                                                                             
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular 
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole person analysis under 
Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09-
07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). 
 
4 
The account number listed by the assignee does not match that of the original credit card account. However, 
the original collection balance of $772 and the identity of the creditor (see AE O) lead me to conclude that 
SOR 1.b and 1.t allege the same debt, which, moreover, is his ex-wife’s responsibility per their divorce 
agreement. (AE E.) Applicant testified that he contacted his ex-wife about the debt, and she agreed to pay it. 
(Tr. 74-76.) 
 
 5 
 
 On September 18, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about his delinquent accounts. Applicant 
indicated that the past-due credit card accounts in SOR 1.e and 1.q were from 2005. He 
expressed his intent to start repaying the debts now that he was employed. Whereas the 
credit card debt in SOR 1.b was his ex-wife’s responsibility, he had little information about 
that debt. Applicant believed he owed hospital bills from his 2012 treatment that were over 
120 days past due. He could not confirm whether the accounts were in collection, but his 
intent was to consolidate the bills to make one payment. When confronted about the 
$1,389 judgment on his credit record (SOR 1.a), Applicant denied any knowledge of the 
debt.
5
 Applicant recognized some of the medical debts (SOR 1.h-1.n) were all owed a local 
hospital. He indicated that SOR 1.c and 1.d were owed a family physician, and SOR 1.o 
was owed a dentist, even though his September 2013 credit report showed the debts were 
respectively placed by a radiologist and a physical therapist. He admitted that the credit 
card debt in SOR 1.u was in collection. Applicant explained that his financial difficulties 
were caused by his unemployment, medical illnesses, and two divorces. He expressed his 
intent to resolve his verified debts and to incur no delinquencies in the future. (GE 4.) 
 
 Applicant did not respond to collection notices received from the hospital or from his 
consumer credit lenders. (Tr. 106.) On March 25, 2014, the judgment debt in SOR 1.a was 
satisfied through attachment of his wages. (AE D; Tr. 140.) After Applicant received the 
SOR, he looked into his other delinquencies. (Tr. 70.) In April 2014, Applicant satisfied the 
medical debt in SOR 1.p.
6
 On May 1, 2014, he paid $30 to settle the medical debt in SOR 
1.d (and perhaps SOR 1.c).
7
 (AE F.) Applicant arranged to repay the credit card debts in 
SOR 1.q and 1.r at $50 each per month. (Tr. 90-91.) On June 11, 2014, Applicant made his 
first $50 monthly payment toward SOR 1.q to reduce the balance to $4,169.09. The debt 
was incurred with a furniture retailer. (AE I; Tr. 92.) Also on June 11, 2014, Applicant paid 
$50 toward the debt in 1.r (duplicated in SOR 1.s) to reduce its balance to $2,929.69. (AE 
J; Tr. 92, 136.) The debt was incurred on a revolving charge with a home improvement 
store to finish his basement. (AE J; Tr. 135.) 
 
                                                 
5 
The judgment is clearly shown on his Trans Union credit report, which predates his interview. Applicant 
testified that he was alerted to the judgment when the creditor attempted to attach his pay at work with his 
current employer. (Tr. 107.) 
 
6 
AE H, dated April 11, 2014, does not confirm payment. Rather, it explains that the assignee would consider 
the debt satisfied on receipt of $94. Applicant indicated in handwriting on AE H that he paid $94 on April 10, 
2014. (Tr. 88-89.) 
  
7 
Handwritten entries on AE F indicate that a $70 debt was settled for $17.50 and a $50 debt for $12.50. The 
aggregate debt balance of $120 matches the amount in collection on the account alleged in SOR 1.d. 
Applicant nonetheless maintains that he also settled the debt in SOR 1.c by the $30 payment. (Tr. 79-80.) 
Applicant’s August 2013 credit report shows two separate collection accounts, totaling $194. His September 
2013 credit report shows that the debts were placed by two different radiologists, albeit on the same day. The 
letter confirming payment references the collection agency, but it does not include an account number. He 
may well have also settled the debt in SOR 1.c. Regardless; the debt balance is too small to raise significant 
financial concerns on its own.  
 
 
 6 
 As of June 17, 2014, Applicant had made no payments on the credit card 
delinquencies in SOR 1.e and 1.u, on the medical debts in SOR 1.f-1.n, which he believes 
are surgery-related charges (Tr. 86), or on the medical debt in SOR 1.o, which he claimed 
he could not verify through an Internet search.
8
 (Tr. 87.)  Around April 21, 2014, Applicant 
learned that the debt in SOR 1.e had been transferred. On June 16, 2014, he arranged to 
pay $25 per month toward its $4,861 balance. The current assignee agreed not to waive 
interest on the past-due debt. (AE G; Tr. 80-81, 84.) Applicant recently contacted the 
assignee collecting the credit card delinquency in SOR 1.u. He was informed that the 
assignee had filed a claim against him in court, and that interest of 12% (about $55 a 
month) continues to accrue on the debt. In response to an offer from the assignee to settle 
the reported $7,600 current balance for $4,000, Applicant indicated that he would make 
monthly payments of $30 or $40, and he asked for a waiver of the interest. The assignee 
rejected his offer and informed him that he had to go to court to have the interest 
dismissed. Applicant testified that he cannot afford to pay $200 a month on the debt. (Tr. 
100-102.) 
 
 Applicant is not sure whether he owes all of the medical debt alleged in SOR 1.f-1.n. 
Sometime before March 2014, Applicant received notice of a proposed settlement of a 
class action lawsuit brought against the insurance company that covered him during his 
employment with the telecommunications company. The medical insurer was alleged to 
have made out-of-network reimbursement determinations that resulted in lower payments 
than entitled under law on partially paid claims for some subscribers between March 1, 
2001, and August 30, 2013. (AE C.) On March 3, 2014, Applicant submitted a claim as a 
subscriber class member, seeking payment from the subscriber settlement fund (up to 5% 
of the allowed amount on each valid partially allowed claim supported by documentation). 
Applicant submitted the local hospital’s invoices, which showed his financial responsibility 
for $3,729.74 on billed charges of $32,816 for care received between March 2010 and 
February 2012. Available documentation (AE N) does not show that he submitted any 
evidence of payment of the balances, even though evidence of his payment was required.
9
 
The claim form expressly stated that without the necessary supporting documentation, the 
claim would not be eligible for payment under the subscriber settlement fund. (AE N.) 
Applicant testified that if he owes the medical debts, he will pay them one at a time. (Tr. 
86.) 
  
 Applicant testified that he earned about $40,000 in 2013. (Tr. 117.) He has been 
working seven days a week lately, and with that overtime, his take-home pay is $900 a 
week. Without overtime, he takes home $600 a week. (Tr. 119.) He recently received a 
                                                 
8 
Applicant’s September 2013 credit report provides an address for the collection agency as well as the name 
of the original medical creditor. (AE O.) There is no evidence that Applicant attempted to contact the named 
physical therapist. 
 
9 
For each partially allowed claim, Applicant was required to provide supporting documentation showing that he 
paid the balance billed. Valid supporting documentation was specified to be a copy of the bill from the out-of-
network health care provider together with a cancelled check or credit card statement showing the 
subscriber’s payment; or a receipt showing payment of the bill together with documentation showing the 
insurer’s reimbursement; or records from the out-of-network health care provider showing the issuance and 
the subscriber’s payment of the bill for a partially allowed claim. (AE N.) 
 
 7 
raise to bring his hourly wage to $22. (Tr. 120.) Applicant fell behind in his electric bill in 
May 2014. He had not paid the past-due utility debt as of his June 17 hearing, although he 
testified it would be paid within the week. (Tr. 123-124.) After paying his monthly expenses, 
Applicant has “a couple hundred” in net income at the end of an average month. (Tr. 138.) 
He does not have a budget. (Tr. 139.) Applicant has about $800 in checking and $1,200 in 
savings account deposits. (Tr. 127.) He received a federal income tax refund of $1,000 to 
$1,500 for tax year 2013, $800 of which went to satisfy his state taxes. (Tr. 127.) 
 
 Since returning to work for the defense contractor in July 2013, Applicant has 
earned the trust and respect of his supervisor and co-workers. Applicant exhibited 
dedication, as evidenced by his round-the-clock coverage over the holidays in 2013, and by 
the “long arduous hours” he has worked. Organized and efficient, he learned his job duties 
“quicker than most.” The company had such confidence in him to transfer him to third shift, 
where he works independently. He was promoted early to his current position of second 
class mechanic. (AEs A, K, L; Tr. 28-31.) Applicant was recently recognized by his 
employer for 15 years of commitment and dedication to the company. (AE M.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
 
 8 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The SOR alleges 21 delinquent accounts, totaling $29,030 in outstanding debt as of 
March 25, 2014. When he answered the SOR, he denied the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 
1.p, and 1.t. The evidence shows that the $1,389 judgment debt in SOR 1.a was paid 
before the date of the SOR, although it does not eliminate the financial concerns raised by 
the delinquency. The $917 credit card debt in SOR 1.b (and SOR 1.t, same debt) was his 
ex-wife’s responsibility in their divorce agreement. As for the $4,861 credit card debt in 
SOR 1.e, Applicant listed the debt on his e-QIP, and he has arranged to make payments 
on the debt. Applicant’s payment of the medical debt in SOR 1.p, which occurred after the 
date of the SOR, is regarded as an admission of its validity. AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” is satisfied only as to the alleged debts 
in SOR 1.b and 1.t (ex-wife’s responsibility) and SOR 1.s, which he had admitted. That 
debt was shown to be the same debt as that alleged in SOR 1.r and not an additional 
delinquency. However, financial judgment concerns arise under AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations” because of the approximately $24,355 in delinquent debt for which he bears 
repayment responsibility (SOR 1.a, 1.c-1.r, and 1.u).

 Concerning the mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long 
ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” does not 
apply. While two of the credit card accounts became seriously delinquent in 2009 (SOR 1.e 
and 1.u), most of the delinquencies were incurred between 2010 and 2012. 
 
 Applicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce, his health problems, and a 
year-long unemployment. Any one of these three circumstances is potentially mitigating 
under AG ¶ 20(b), which provides as follows: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant and his second wife were divorced in July 2008. Presumably, the divorce had a 
negative impact on his finances, but I cannot speculate about the extent. In their divorce 
settlement, Applicant did not have to pay alimony because his ex-wife was self-supporting. 
Applicant’s ex-wife assumed responsibility for the debts in her name as well as for one joint 
account (SOR 1.b, 1.t same debt). She may well have been contributing to the household 
finances during their marriage. The evidence shows that Applicant stopped paying on the 
credit card debts in SOR 1.e and 1.u during the October to November 2009 time frame, so 
his default on those accounts may well have been due partially to his divorce. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established in that unexpected medical problems between 2010 and 
2012 led to a significant loss of income, which negatively affected his ability to address the 
credit card delinquencies in SOR 1.e and 1.u and caused other accounts to become 
delinquent between 2010 and 2012. During three separate, lengthy medical leaves of 
absence, he received temporary disability pay that was less than his wages would have 
been had he been able to work. Applicant also incurred medical costs, although the 
financial strain caused by those expenses was not fully shown. Available hospital records 
indicate that he was billed $3,729.74, little more than ten percent of the total medical 
expenses incurred. As of June 2014, he owed the hospital at least $3,503 (SOR 1.f-1.n), 
so payments to the hospital, if any, have been minimal. 
 
 When he returned to work from his medical leave in late June or early July 2012, 
Applicant was fired by his then employer for allegedly falsifying his time sheets. Applicant 
disputes that he falsified his time records. The SOR does not allege any improper conduct 
relating to his employment termination. Applicant was awarded unemployment, which the 
company challenged unsuccessfully. Under these circumstances, I cannot concur with the 
Government’s position that the unemployment was a factor within his control. Applicant 
collected about $14,000 in unemployment compensation over the next year, which was 
significantly less than his employment income of $29 an hour. AG ¶ 20(b) mitigates his 
nonpayment of consumer credit and medical debts during his unemployment. His income 
was not sufficient to cover living expenses and debt payments. 
 
 
 10 
 Yet AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that an individual act responsibly to deal with financial 
setbacks. Applicant regained full-time employment in July 2013. Applicant knew as of his e-
QIP that the credit card accounts in SOR 1.e and 1.r (same debt in SOR 1.s) had been 
delinquent for some time. Even accounting for a reasonable amount of time to regain his 
financial stability, Applicant made little effort to contact his creditors before he received the 
SOR in April 2014. He did not respond to medical collection notices from the hospital or 
from his credit card lenders. (Tr. 106.) AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate the financial judgment 
concerns raised by the reactive manner in which he handled his debt obligations. 
 
 Applicant paid the judgment in SOR 1.a, about six months after he obtained his 
credit report showing the judgment. He claims he received no correspondence about the 
judgment from the court. Applicant’s resolution of the judgment debt, albeit through wage 
garnishment, and the medical debts in 1.d (and perhaps 1.c) and 1.p implicate AG ¶ 20(c), 
“the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and to a lesser extent, 
AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.” Debts paid so belatedly or in response to wage garnishment are 
not accorded the same weight in mitigation as timely, proactive efforts to address debts. 
 
 As of June 17, 2014, Applicant had arranged to repay the credit card delinquencies 
in SOR 1.q and 1.r (SOR 1.s same debt) at $50 per month each, and he had made his first 
payments. He had just arranged to repay the credit card debt in SOR 1.e at $25 a month. 
These payment arrangements are credible evidence of his sincerity with respect to his 
intent to address his delinquent accounts. However, no payment plans are in place with 
respect to the credit card debt in SOR 1.u. Interest is continuing to accrue on the debt to 
bring the balance to approximately $7,600. He has made no payments on the medical 
debts owed the local hospital, three of which are under $100 (SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.n). When 
Applicant filed his settlement claim in March 2014, he did not submit any proof of payments 
required to substantiate a subscriber claim. So, it is unclear whether he will receive any 
funds under the settlement. AG ¶ 20(c) and ¶ 20(d) are not fully established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
10

The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 11 
Applicant’s financial problems started after his divorce in 2008. His financial stability 
was later compromised by serious medical problems, which led to lost income. However, 
once his medical issues and employment situation had stabilized, Applicant could 
reasonably be expected to address his delinquent debts. 
 
In making the whole-person assessment required under the Directive, the DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to 
resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Even assuming that he settled the 
debts in SOR 1.c and 1.d by one $30 payment, he has resolved only about $1,677 of his 
delinquent debts. After paying $50 each on the debts in SOR 1.q and 1.r, he owes 
respective balances of $4,169.09 and $2,929.69. He had yet to make the first payment of 
$25 toward the $4,861 credit card debt in SOR 1.e, and he had no plans in place to resolve 
the debt in SOR 1.u, which due to interest, has accrued to $7,600. Those debts are not 
likely to be resolved in the near future. 
 
Applicant’s work record with his defense contractor employer is unassailable. He 
has exhibited dedication on the job, and the quality of his work since July 2013 led to an 
early promotion for him. While recognizing that he needs a stable income to address his 
debts, it would be premature at this time to conclude that his financial problems are safely 
behind him. He has not demonstrated a track record of regular payments toward his past-
due debts. Moreover, despite a reported $800 in checking and $1,200 in saving account 
deposits, Applicant was behind on his electric bill as of his security clearance hearing, 
which raises doubts about his ability to manage his finances responsibly. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990.). For the reasons 
noted above, based on the facts before me and the adjudicative guidelines that I am 
required to consider, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time.

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
