DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 21, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance. Applicant answered the SOR on April 
 
2 
 
 
10, 2014, and requested a hearing on May 14, 2014. This case was assigned to me on 
May 19, 2014. On June 4, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for June 23, 2014. The hearing was 
held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
6, while Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A though F. The record of 
the proceeding was left open until July 7, 2014, to provide Applicant an opportunity to 
present additional matters. He submitted documents that were marked as AE G through 
R. All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript 
(Tr.) of the hearing was received on July 1, 2014. 
 
Procedural Matter 
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel made motions to withdraw the allegations in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.g. Applicant had no objections to those motions. The motions were 
granted, and the noted allegations were withdrawn.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old senior software analyst who works for a defense 
contractor. He has been working for his current employer since August 2002. He was 
born overseas, entered the United States in June 1980, and became a U.S. citizen in 
May 1999. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1989. He 
married in March 1997. He and his wife are separated and divorce proceedings are 
ongoing. They have two children, a son 11 years old and a daughter 16 years old. 
Applicant has held a security clearance without incident since about 2002.2 
 
Excluding the withdrawn allegations, the SOR alleged that Applicant had five 
delinquent debts totaling $214,281 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f). In his Answer to 
the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR ¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e and denied the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.f. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Each of the 
alleged debts is reflected in a credit report that was admitted into evidence.3 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to a combination of setbacks. These 
included the collapse of the housing market, his divorce proceeding, and his child’s 
medical problems.   
 
In 2003, Applicant entered into a real estate development partnership with 
another individual. This was a secondary job for both of them. In 2004, they purchased

property to develop. In 2005, they broke ground to construct four housing units on that 
property. Applicant stated that the project was not managed properly and contractors 
were not readily available, which generated delays. The project was originally planned 
to be completed in 9-12 months, but ended up being delayed by 2 years. He borrowed 
money from a personal line of equity, from personal credit cards, and from his mother to 
keep the project afloat. By the time construction was completed and a certificate of 
occupancy was issued in 2008, the housing market had collapsed, and he was unable 
to find buyers or renters for the units. He hired attorneys to assist him and ended up 
relinquishing the units to a bank. Applicant estimated that he lost about $230,000 on this 
project.4  
 
In 2010, Applicant and his wife separated, and she filed for divorce. At that time, 
she was employed selling time shares. In May 2011, a court issued a temporary order 
requiring Applicant to pay $2,500 per month in spousal and child support. In addition, he 
was providing support to his wife in the form of car and insurance payments and paying 
their son’s medical expenses (discussed below). On his own, Applicant decided to 
reduce the spousal/child support payments to account for the other forms of financial 
support he was providing. As a result of that decision, he was cited for contempt of court 
and placed in jail for two days. He testified that he was released upon payment of 
$9,000 in attorneys’ fees and $3,000 in spousal support. He had to borrow money to 
make those payments. Applicant estimated that he has paid about $65,000 so far for 
legal expenses related to the divorce proceeding. At the time of this hearing, he and his 
wife were going through mediation to address the amount of spousal and child support 
and the division of marital assets. He anticipates the mediation may cost about $3,600. 
His legal fees may increase if mediation fails and litigation is required.5 
 
As early as 2011, Applicant’s son was diagnosed with a mental health disorder. 
He attended special schools and received special monitoring because of his mental 
health condition. At one point, he attended a school that cost about $3,000 for a three-
month period. His son now attends public school.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – mortgage loan in foreclosure that was past due $79,796, with a 
balance of $192,195. Applicant purchased this house for $198,000 in January 1998. He 
put a down payment of about $50,000 and initially had a mortgage loan of $130,000. He

a. The parties combined expenditures from their respective financial affidavits 
exceed $12,000 monthly while their combined income is $8,000 creating a 
monthly deficit of $4,000. 
b. The parties are going to have to adjust their lifestyles to accommodate their 
current financial situation. They cannot continue to spend as they have been.

refinanced that loan several times and withdrew equity from the house. He defaulted on 
the mortgage loan in about June 2008. After his marital separation, his wife remained in 
the house until about August 2013. Applicant acknowledged that no payments were 
made on the mortgage loan for about five years while the house was occupied. The 
house has been foreclosed. Applicant did not know if the house had been resold or 
whether he owed a deficiency on the mortgage loan. In his Answer to the SOR, he 
denied this debt because the account was closed.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b, – charged-off account for $123,500. This was a home equity line of 
credit obtained from a credit union. Money from this loan was used to fund his real 
estate development project. The date of last activity on this debt was July 2009. This 
debt remains unresolved.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – collection account for $2,388. This was a credit card debt that had a 
date of last activity of May 2009. Applicant used this credit card for his real estate 
development business. This debt remains unresolved.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – charged-off account for $1,955. This was a bank account that had a 
date of last activity of July 2009. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he 
was disputing this debt because he requested the bank to terminate certain automatic 
withdrawals from the account, but the bank continued to authorize those withdrawals 
totaling about $1,900. No documentation was presented to establish that Applicant had 
a legitimate basis for disputing this debt.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $6,644. This was a personal credit card 
account that Applicant used for his real estate development business. It had a date of 
last activity of June 2009. He testified that this debt remains unresolved.11 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $151,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant 
submitted a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) dated July 1, 2014, that reflected his 
total net monthly income was $8,408, his total monthly expenses were $7,482, and his 
total monthly debt payments were $630, which left him a net monthly remainder of 
$296. The total monthly debt payments did not include payments toward the alleged 
debts. His PFS indicated that he had assets totaling $247,000, including $230,000 in a

401(k) account. In his testimony, he noted that he was working with attorneys to resolve 
his financial problems.12 
 
Applicant’s credit report of July 2003 indicated that he had no delinquent 
accounts. He testified that he resolved delinquent debts that were not alleged in the 
SOR. One was a $28,000 debt that he resolved for $13,000 in 2013 by using a tax 
refund. His most recent credit report indicated that he had settled debts for less than the 
full balance.13 
 
Between 2008 and 2012, Applicant took three vacations out of the country. 
These included trips to Mexico in July 2008, the Bahamas in March 2011, and Mexico in 
September 2012.14 
 
Applicant has consistently received monetary awards at work. Over the years, his 
performance evaluations have rated him as a “successful contributor,” “high 
contributor,” or “exceptional contributor.” His supervisor has stated that he exhibited 
candor, honesty, and integrity.15 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
                                                          
12 Tr. 38, 60-63, 69; AE R. 
13 Tr. 53-58; GE 1, 2, 3; AE F, G. Delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR will not be considered 
in applying the disqualifying conditions. They, however, may be considered to assess an applicant’s 
credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; or as part of the whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct 26, 2006).

law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
7 
 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to satisfy 
for an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems were the result of conditions beyond his control. 
These conditions included the collapse of the housing market that resulted in the failure 
of his real estate development business, his pending divorce, and his child’s medical 
problems. He failed, however, in establishing that he has acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. His financial problems are ongoing and significant. While he has 
 
8 
 
 
resolved some delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR, he failed to show that 
he is taking meaningful steps to resolve the alleged debts. He has neither established 
repayment plans for any of the alleged debts nor presented a realistic plan for resolving 
them.  
 
 From the evidence presented, I cannot find that Applicant‘s financial problems 
are under control or are being resolved. His delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not presented 
documentation to show that he has a legitimate basis for disputing the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.e. None of the mitigating conditions apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has worked for his company for almost 12 years and is a valued 
employee. He has held a security clearance without incident during that time. However, 
he failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial concerns raised in the 
SOR. He has paid debts not alleged in the SOR, but failed to show he has taken any 
meaningful action to resolve the alleged debts. His financial problems remain a security 
concern.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
 
9 
 
 
conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security 
concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.b:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.c:   Withdrawn 
   Subparagraphs 1.d – 1.f:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.g:   Withdrawn  
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
