LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. 
Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 2, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security 
Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on May 7, 2014, and elected to have the case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government’s written case was 
submitted on May 19, 2014. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) 
was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and 
submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. Applicant 
received the FORM on May 21, 2014. She responded with a memorandum and 
 
2 
documents that have been marked Applicant’s exhibits (AE) 1 through 33. The case 
was assigned to me on July 15, 2014. The Government exhibits included in the FORM 
(Items 4-7) and AE 1 through 33 are admitted without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is applying for 
eligibility to hold a public trust position. She received a bachelor’s degree in 1998 and a 
master’s degree in 2002. She has never married and she has no children.1 
  
 The SOR alleges $148,564 in unpaid student loans (SOR ¶ 1.a); federal tax 
debts of $3,272 and $4,335 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c); a $2,414 state tax debt (SOR ¶ 1.d); 
failure to file state income tax returns (SOR ¶ 1.e); a $10,014 defaulted timeshare loan 
(SOR ¶ 1.f); a $10,083 defaulted car loan (SOR ¶ 1.g); and ten delinquent debts totaling 
about $9,861 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h to 1.q). 
 
 Applicant stated that her financial problems started in 2005 when she bought her 
first home. She stated that the mortgage lender promised her that her monthly 
payments would be $830, but she actually had to pay $955, which was more than she 
could afford. Her September 2011 and November 2013 credit reports show a mortgage 
account with a high credit of $149,957, with a zero balance. The listed terms were 
$1,027 per month for 360 months. Applicant stated that she used her credit and payday 
loans in an attempt to maintain the mortgage payments, but the house was eventually 
lost to foreclosure. Applicant stated the lender’s practices were unreasonable and 
unfair. She was awarded $1,900 in damages from two lawsuits against the lender.2 
 
 Applicant was employed with a company from 2001 through January 2010. She 
took time off work to care for family members who had medical problems. She also 
indicated that she was bullied by her manager. She stated that she left the job because 
“[m]edical conditions with family members caused stress and work time so I chose to 
leave to deal with family matters, reassess life goals and then return to the workforce.” 
She was unemployed until she was hired at her current position in February 2011.3 
 
 Applicant defaulted on her student loans. Her September 2011 credit report 
shows $143,260 owed for two student loan accounts in collection. Applicant stated that 
she paid about $3,000 in 2011 to bring the loans out of default. Her November 2013 
credit report shows the student loans consolidated into one account with a balance of 
$147,565. The student loans are listed as deferred and not past due. The loans are 
                                                          
1 Item 3. 
 
2 Items 3-7; AE 1. Applicant’s mortgage foreclosure was not alleged in the SOR. Any financial matters 
that were not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. They may be considered 
when assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in 
analyzing the “whole person.” 
 
3 Items 3-5.

currently in forbearance. Applicant stated that she is addressing other debts while her 
student loans are in forbearance.4 
 
 Applicant did not pay her federal taxes for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 
2012 when they were due. She entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in 
December 2013 to pay her back taxes for the above tax years. The taxes for 2007 have 
been paid. In June 2014, the IRS indicated that with penalties and interest, she owed 
$2,569 for tax year 2008; $4,663 for tax year 2009; $5,052 for tax year 2011; and 
$3,537 for tax year 2012; for a total amount owed of $15,822.5  
 
 Applicant did not pay her state income taxes when they were due for multiple 
years. The state placed tax liens against her in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. The 2008, 
2010, and 2012 liens were released when the taxes were paid. In December 2012, the 
state placed a levy on Applicant’s wages of $3,609 for unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, 
and costs for tax years 2009 and 2010. She filed her 2012 state income tax return, but 
she did not pay what was owed by the deadline. In June 2013, the state indicated that 
she owed $1,124 with penalties and interest for tax year 2012. In August 2013, the 
collection company representing the state indicated that she owed $2,218. On July 2, 
2014, Applicant sent a letter to the collection company asking to pay the full amount of 
$2,218 through monthly $40 payments starting in August 2014.6 
 
 Applicant bought a timeshare in about 2007. She regretted her decision and 
attempted to rescind the contract, but was unsuccessful. She never stayed in the 
timeshare and she did not make any payments. In November 2007, the lender sent her 
a letter stating the amount due was $733. The timeshare was foreclosed and returned 
to the lender. Her 2011 and 2013 credit reports show the timeshare as a repossession 
with a high credit and balance of $10,124. On July 2, 2014, Applicant sent the lender a 
letter offering to settle the debt for $366 through three monthly payments of $122.7 
 
 Applicant bought a car in about 2005. Her 2011 and 2013 credit reports show the 
car loan account was opened in April 2005 with a high credit of $25,265. The terms of 
the loan were monthly payments of $469 for 72 months. The date of last action was 
November 2007. The car was repossessed. The lender charged off $10,083, which is 
also the amount listed as the past-due amount and the balance of the loan. Applicant 
stated that she voluntarily returned the car when the lender would not work with her and 
grant a payment extension. On June 26, 2014, Applicant sent a letter to the lender 
offering to settle the debt for $5,099 through monthly payments of $25 until she can 
increase that amount.8

 In April 2014, Applicant paid the $123 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q. In May 
2014, Applicant and the collection company holding the $512 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i 
and the $428 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j agreed to settle the first debt for $204, through 
four monthly payments of $51, and the second debt for $214, through four monthly 
payments of $53. Applicant established that she made the first monthly payments 
toward the settlements in June 2014. In May 2014, she settled the $711 debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.l for $249. She settled the $239 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p for $119. In June 
2014, she paid $50 toward the $646 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n.9 
 
 On June 26, 2014, Applicant sent a letter to the collection company holding the 
$693 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. She offered to settle the debt for $490 through five 
monthly payments of $98 starting in September 2014. On July 2, 2014, she sent a letter 
to the collection company holding the $267 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o offering to settle 
the debt for $160 through a lump-sum payment.10 
 
 Applicant admitted owing the $5,000 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. She 
stated that she would contact the collection company handling the debt. She denied 
owing the $1,241 debt to a collection company that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. The debt is 
listed on the 2013 credit report, but it does not identify the original creditor.11 
 
 Applicant completed a 13-week financial counseling course in April 2012. In June 
2014, she contracted for additional financial counseling through another counseling 
service. She stated that she is committed to addressing all her financial issues and 
attaining financial stability.12 
 
Policies 
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.” 
(See Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  “The standard that must be met for 
. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” (See 
Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence 
and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness 
adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service 
and Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are 
afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.)

5 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the 
adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, 
impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” 
The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 
 
6 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay her financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c). 
 
 It has not been established that Applicant failed to file her 2012 state income tax 
return. AG ¶ 19(g) is not applicable. SOR ¶ 1.e is concluded for Applicant. 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns 
are provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; 
 
 Applicant stated that her financial problems started in 2005 when she bought her 
first home, and her monthly mortgage payments were more than she was told they 
would be. She had sick family members and she lost time at work. She also stated that 
she was bullied by her supervisor. She was unemployed from January 2010 through 
February 2011. To the extent that the above events were beyond her control, for the full 
application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must also have acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.  
 
 
7 
 Applicant may have struggled to pay her mortgage loan, but that does not explain 
why she bought a timeshare in about 2007. She lost her house, timeshare, and car to 
foreclosure or repossession; and she did not pay her state and federal income taxes, 
student loans, and other debts. 
 
 Applicant paid, settled, or made substantial progress in payment plans for the 
debts alleged SOR ¶¶ 1.i. 1.j, 1.l, 1.p, and 1.q. The $1,241 debt to a collection company 
that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is listed on the 2013 credit report, but it does not identify the 
original creditor. Those debts are mitigated, but she still has a substantial amount of 
debt to be addressed. 
 
 Applicant receives less credit in mitigation for the payments made through 
garnishment of her wages. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010). 
Her recent efforts and payment arrangements also require greater scrutiny. The Appeal 
Board has held that “intentions to pay off debts in the future are not a substitute for a 
track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches.” See ISCR Case No. 
11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013) (quoting ISCR Case No. 08-08440 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 11, 2009)).  
 
 Applicant’s student loans are currently in forbearance, but she will have to start 
paying them at some point. Her track record is not good and her finances remain 
precarious. She received financial counseling, but I have no confidence that she will 
attain financial stability. 
 
 There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her 
debts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(d) are not 
applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. The first section of AG ¶ 20(c) is 
applicable; the second section is not. I find that financial considerations concerns 
remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should 
consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
8 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 I considered the circumstances surrounding Applicant’s financial problems. 
However, Applicant has not convinced me that she will attain financial stability within the 
foreseeable future.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.h-1.j:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.m-1.o:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.p-1.q:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
