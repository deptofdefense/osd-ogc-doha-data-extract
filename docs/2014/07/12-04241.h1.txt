GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 28, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On August 1, 2013, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued him a set 
of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on August 30, 2013.2 On March 
21, 2014, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to

Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn statement, dated April 
18, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on May 1, 2014. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2014. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on May 12, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
May 29, 2014.3 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and ten 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. Following a substantial delay, the transcript (Tr.) was finally received 
on July 16, 2014. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant 
took advantage of that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were 
marked as exhibits (AE K through AE AL) and admitted into evidence without objection. 
The record closed on June 16, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.n., 1.p. through 1.r., 1.u. through 
1.w., 1.y., and 1.z.). Applicant’s answers and explanations are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
May 2014, he has served as a mechanic.4 He was previously a tractor-trailer 
owner/operator.5 Applicant was unemployed from November 2007 until May 2008, and 
again from June 2011 until July 2011.6 He served on active duty in an enlisted capacity

 The Directive established that notification as to the date, time, and place of a hearing be furnished to an 
applicant at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, 
Department Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the 
actual Notice of Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and the 
hearing was approximately 15 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant 
specifically waived the 15-day notice requirement. See, Tr. at 13-14.

 Tr. at 43-44. Applicant explained that he has been working on the same contract since July 2011, but the 
contract was awarded to another contractor in May 2014, and Applicant was transitioned to the new employer on that 
date.

with the U.S. Navy from July 1981 until August 1996, when he took an early retirement 
option and retired with an honorable discharge.7 Applicant held a secret security 
clearance during an unspecified period while serving on active duty.8 He does not 
currently have a security clearance.9 
  
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1975.10 He has been married on 
five occasions: from November 1977 until October 1980; January 1988 until June 1990; 
December 1991 until he was widowed in October 1993; November 1995 until May 1997; 
and in June 2009.11 He has no children.12 
 
Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his active military service, Applicant was awarded the Navy Achievement 
Medal (two awards), the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy “E” Ribbon (six 
awards), the Good Conduct Medal (four awards), the Southwest Asia Service Medal 
(three awards), the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (four awards), the U.S. Coast 
Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the 
Joint Meritorious Unit Award, and the Navy Expert Pistol Medal.13  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2005. Several 
years earlier, without possessing smart business acumen, and without obtaining 
business guidance, he had fulfilled a dream of running his own company.14 At one point, 
he had three trucks and three employees.15 A combination of circumstances starting in 
2005 had a negative financial impact on his business. Applicant acknowledged making 
mistakes in his business. As the economy became less stable and work diminished, the 
cost of fuel, repairs, and general overhead, increased, making it more difficult for him to 
maintain his monthly payments. He scrambled to keep everything going, but was forced 
to sell some of his assets and lay off employees to resolve some of his debts.16 After a 
couple of years, with mounting bills, unpaid business taxes, and diminished assets, the

business was no longer able to remain viable, and he shut it down. Applicant had lost 
his trucks, his personal truck, as well as all of his other assets. He sought any type of 
employment to make some money to pay his bills, for his only other income was his 
Navy pension of $990 per month.17 He never collected unemployment compensation.18 
With insufficient funds to address his bills, his accounts became delinquent and were 
either placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. Taxes remained unpaid. In 
2006, Applicant’s pick-up truck was repossessed, and his wages were garnished by the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  
In an effort to both earn and save money, Applicant lived with friends and worked 
any jobs he could find. He mowed lawns with a push mower, pumped septic tanks, and 
repaired vehicles.19 He finally obtained a job as a mechanic, remarried, and started 
rebuilding his life and assets. He filed for hardship with the IRS in 2008 or 2009, but his 
application was never acknowledged.20 Applicant’s problems were intensified in 2009, 
when he had a stroke and was hospitalized for nearly one week. He subsequently had 
double hernia surgery as well as back surgery.21 Applicant considered filing for 
bankruptcy, and actually paid an attorney a $400 deposit to do so, but did not feel it was 
“the right way to take care of this problem.”22 He concluded that the bills were his 
responsibility, so he terminated the effort, and his intentions are to pay every one of 
them.23 Once he started making a regular salary, Applicant approached many of his 
creditors in an effort to set up repayment arrangements. Applicant’s overall repayment 
strategy was to first resolve his IRS bills, move on to his state tax issues as well as the 
smaller debts, and then address his remaining delinquent debts.24  
In August 2013, Applicant enrolled in two courses related to financial counseling. 
He took credit counseling and debtor education.25 At some other unspecified time, he 
spoke with some credit union financial counselors and reviewed his credit report and all 
of his accounts.26 In June 2014, he met with a relief services assistant with the Navy-
Marine Corps Relief Society and set up a budget.27 A review of Applicant’s budget 
reveals a total net family income of $5,239.95. With routine monthly family living

expenses, including rent or mortgage, utilities, food, and transportation, and debt 
payments of $3,971.81, he has approximately $1,218.14 available for discretionary 
spending or savings.28  
The SOR identified 27 delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, 
charged off, went to judgment, became tax liens, or resulted in a repossession, as 
generally reflected by an October 2011 credit report and a July 2013 credit report.29 
Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the 
credit reports, in some instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the 
same creditor name or under a different creditor name. While the SOR does not include 
complete or even partial account numbers, several accounts in the credit reports are 
listed with only partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by 
the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below. 
The debts listed in the SOR can be divided into four separate categories: (1) 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full; 
(2) those that are currently being paid under a repayment agreement; (3) those for 
which repayment plans and settlements have been discussed, but which payments 
have not yet commenced; and (4) various other accounts where the status is unclear.  
The largest number of accounts listed in the SOR fall within the first category - 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full. 
There were six state tax liens filed against Applicant: for $295 (SOR ¶ 1.b.), $193 (SOR 
¶ 1.c.), $411 (SOR ¶ 1.d.), $472 (SOR ¶ 1.e.), $361 (SOR ¶ 1.f.), and $218 (SOR ¶ 
1.g.). They have all been resolved and the tax liens have been cancelled.30  
There were two medical accounts that were placed for collection: for $75 (SOR ¶ 
1.i.), and $250 (SOR ¶ 1.j.).31 Both accounts have been paid in full, and they have been 
resolved.32  
There was a bank credit card with a high credit of $4,947 and a past-due balance 
of $5,709 that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.n.).33 The collection agent increased

the past-due balance to $6,113.34 Applicant and the collection agent agreed to settle the 
account for $500, and that amount was paid, leaving a zero balance.35 The account has 
been resolved.  
There was a utility bill with a past-due balance of $94 that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.r.).36 The bill was paid in full, leaving a zero balance.37 The account 
has been resolved.  
There was a medical bill with an unpaid balance of $156 that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.u.).38 The bill was paid in full, leaving a zero balance.39 The account 
has been resolved.  
There was an account with a furniture store with a high credit of $2,085 and a 
zero balance (SOR ¶ 1.v.).40 Although the SOR alleged the account was 30 days past 
due, there is no evidence to support the allegation, as the account is not listed in the 
2013 Equifax Credit Report (GE 4) or in any of the three subsequent credit reports 
submitted by Applicant.41  Furthermore, Applicant contends he paid off the account five, 
six, or seven years ago, but he submitted no documentation to support his contention.42 
Nevertheless, it appears that the account has been resolved.  
There was a utility bill with a past-due balance of $300 that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.y.).43 The bill was paid in full, leaving a zero balance.44 The account 
has been resolved.  
There was an overdrawn checking account with a past-due balance of $43 that 
was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.z.) and eventually sold to a debt purchaser.45 The bill 
was paid in full, leaving a zero balance.46 The account has been resolved.

The second category of accounts alleged in the SOR - those that are currently 
being paid under a repayment agreement, is as follows. There were delinquent taxes, 
later turned into liens, owed to the IRS for the tax years 2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011, 
allegedly totaling approximately $18,962 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).47 The IRS initially garnished 
Applicant’s savings, which were in an account along with his 83-year-old mother’s social 
security payments, but they later returned the social security payments.48 Applicant 
entered into an installment agreement with the IRS at some point before February 2013, 
or as he estimated about 16 months before the hearing,49 and has been making monthly 
payments of $185 since at least February 2013. In so doing, as of June 18, 2014, he 
has managed to reduce the remaining balance owed to $14,236.93, including interest 
and penalties.50 The account is in the process of being resolved.  
There is a medical bill with a past-due balance of $1,690 that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.h.).51 Applicant approached the collection agent and offered to 
make monthly payments of $50 because he was not working at the time, and his offer 
was initially refused.52 After the account was sold to a debt purchaser, Applicant made 
the same offer, and this time the offer was accepted. He made his initial $50 payment in 
June 2014, and as of June 6, 2014, the remaining balance is $1,640.02.53 The account 
is in the process of being resolved. 
The third category of accounts alleged in the SOR - those for which repayment 
plans and settlements have been discussed, but which payments have not yet 
commenced, is as follows. There is a satellite television account with a past-due 
balance of $631 that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.k.).54 Consistent with his earlier 
expressed repayment plans, Applicant intends to start making monthly payments of $50 
in the middle of November 2014.55 Once his initial payment is confirmed, the status of 
the account will transition to in the process of being resolved.

There is a telephone account with a past-due balance of $429 that was placed 
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.l.).56 Consistent with his earlier expressed repayment plans, 
Applicant intends to start making monthly payments of $75 in the middle of November 
2014.57 Once his initial payment is confirmed, the status of the account will transition to 
in the process of being resolved.  
There is a medical account with a past-due balance of $181 that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.m.).58 Applicant intended to make a lump-sum payment of the full 
amount by the end of July 2014, and contacted the collection agent to inquire if he could 
obtain a receipt for the proposed payment, but nothing could be worked out.59 Once his 
payment is confirmed, the status of the account will transition to resolved.  
There is a credit card account with a past-due balance of $936 that was placed 
for collection and later went to judgment (SOR ¶ 1.q.).60 Applicant approached the 
creditor and offered to make monthly payments, but his offer was refused.61 Consistent 
with his earlier expressed repayment plans, Applicant intends to start making monthly 
payments of $100 when his other remaining accounts have been resolved.62 Once his 
initial payment is confirmed, the status of the account will transition to in the process of 
being resolved.  
There is a telephone account with a past-due balance of $382 that was placed 
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.x.).63 Consistent with his earlier expressed repayment plans, 
Applicant intends to start making monthly payments of $127.33 at the end of August 
2014, with the intention of paying it off by the end November 2014.64 Once his initial 
payment is confirmed, the status of the account will transition to in the process of being 
resolved. 
The fourth category of accounts alleged in the SOR - various other accounts 
where the status is unclear, is as follows. There is a telephone account with a past-due 
balance of $1,077 that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.t.).65 Applicant informally 
disputed the bill because when he enrolled in the service, because of his limited funds,

there was an agreement that there would be a limit of $150 on its use, and the creditor 
subsequently ignored the limitation, allowing the balance to increase.66 The account 
was apparently sold to a debt purchaser, and the account in July 2013 reflects a $1,076 
balance (SOR ¶ 1.o.).67 Applicant contends the two accounts are actually the same 
account, but he has been unable to formally dispute them as neither account is listed in 
his 2014 credit reports.68 He has submitted no documentation to support his 
contentions. Because the most current credit reports do not report the accounts, it 
remains unclear if they have been resolved.  
There was an unspecified account with a bank with a past-due balance of $4,690 
that was placed for collection and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.p.).69 Applicant indicated that he 
has been unable to formally dispute the account as it is not listed in his 2014 credit 
reports.70 Because the most current credit reports do not report the account, it remains 
unclear if it has been resolved.  
There is a satellite television account with a past-due balance of $999 that was 
placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.s.).71Applicant claimed he returned equipment to the 
creditor and received a receipt for the return, but the creditor denied ever receiving the 
equipment, and Applicant subsequently lost the receipt.72 Applicant indicated that he 
has been unable to formally dispute the account as it is not listed in his 2014 credit 
reports.73 Because the most current credit reports do not report the account, it remains 
unclear if it has been resolved.  
There was an automobile finance account listed two separate times in Applicant’s 
2011 credit report, reflecting a high credit of $28,534 and an unpaid balance of $5,895, 
following a repossession, that was charged off, as well as a high credit of $5,895, a 
charge-off, and a zero balance (SOR ¶ 1.w.).74 The SOR alleged the account had a high 
credit of $5,895 that had not been paid. Applicant contends that his vehicle was 
repossessed and sold at auction, and that the proceeds from the auction were sufficient

that the account had been resolved. While the account is listed in his 2013 credit 
report,76 it is not listed in any of the three subsequent credit reports submitted by 
Applicant.77 Because the most current credit reports do not report the account, it 
remains unclear if it has been resolved. 
There is an automobile insurance account with a balance of $494 that was 
placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.aa.).78 Applicant claimed he cancelled the coverage less 
than a month after he obtained the policy when he sold the vehicle. The creditor refused 
to prorate the balance and insisted on the full amount.79 Although he disputed the 
charges with the creditor over the phone, Applicant has been unable to formally dispute 
the account as it is not listed in his 2014 credit reports.80 Because the most current 
credit reports do not report the account, it remains unclear if it has been resolved.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s immediate supervisor noted that Applicant is the most qualified 
person on his shift based on the number of qualifications he holds; that he serves as the 
acting supervisor in his absence; and that Applicant is reliable, dependable, and 
trustworthy.81 Applicant’s site manager, who has known Applicant for 21 years since 
they served together in the USN, would trust his life to Applicant.82 He also noted in 
Applicant’s performance appraisal that Applicant’s can-do attitude, skill level, and 
teaching level had raised the shop to a level of excellence that is now the standard for 
all other shops to follow.83 Another co-worker, a former command master chief who has 
known and/or worked with Applicant for approximately 25 years, noted that Applicant 
was screened in the USN’s Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) - designed to permit 
only the most trustworthy individuals to have access to nuclear weapons, chemical 
weapons, and biological weapons, to work with and load nuclear weapons if the 
situation ever arose. He characterized Applicant as follows:84

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”85 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”86   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”87 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.88  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”89 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”90 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

13 
                                      
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Also, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 19(g), if there is a 
failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same. Commencing in 2005, and continuing for several years 
thereafter, Applicant was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments. 
Various accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection, charged off, 
or went to judgment. Taxes remained unpaid. A pick-up truck was repossessed, and his 
wages were garnished by the IRS. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. However, because 
there is no evidence to indicate Applicant failed to file income tax returns, but there is 
evidence that he failed to pay business taxes, AG ¶ 19(g) has not been established.   
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.91  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 2005 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control. When the economy became less stable and work 
diminished, the cost of fuel, repairs, and general overhead, increased, making it more 
                                                          
91
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

difficult for him to maintain his monthly payments. He scrambled to keep everything 
going, but was forced to sell some of his assets and lay off employees to resolve some 
of his debts. Eventually, the business was no longer able to remain viable, and he shut 
it down. Applicant had lost his trucks, his personal truck, as well as all of his other 
assets.  
Applicant sought any type of employment to make some money to pay his bills, 
for his only other income was his Navy pension. He lived with friends and worked any 
jobs he could find. He mowed lawns with a push mower, pumped septic tanks, and 
repaired vehicles. He finally obtained a job as a mechanic and started rebuilding his life 
and assets. Applicant’s problems were intensified in 2009, when he had a stroke and 
was hospitalized for nearly one week. He subsequently had double hernia surgery as 
well as back surgery. Applicant considered filing for bankruptcy, but concluded that the 
bills were his responsibility, and his intentions are to pay every one of them. Once he 
started making a regular salary, Applicant approached many of his creditors in an effort 
to set up repayment arrangements. Applicant’s overall repayment strategy was to first 
resolve his IRS bills, move on to his state tax issues as well as the smaller debts, and 
then address his remaining delinquent debts.  
He enrolled in two courses related to financial counseling, he spoke with some 
credit union financial counselors and reviewed his credit report and all of his accounts, 
and he met with a relief services assistant with the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society 
and set up a budget. Applicant acted responsibly by addressing nearly all of his 
delinquent accounts, and working with his creditors.92 Of the 27 SOR-debts, the vast 
majority of those debts have already been resolved, either through settlement or by 
payment in full. Other debts are in repayment plans, and Applicant has either 
commenced making the required payments, or is about to do so. The status of the 
remaining accounts remains unclear, but it appears that Applicant is still attempting to 
resolve them. With his current job, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting 
him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.93 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
                                                          
92
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.94       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Without 
possessing smart business acumen or experience in the private sector, and without 
obtaining business guidance, Applicant started his own company. His handling of his 
finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, various 
accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection, charged off, or went 
to judgment. Taxes remained unpaid. A pick-up truck was repossessed, and his wages 
were garnished by the IRS.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. He 
is a decorated retired member of the USN who participated in deployments and was 
entrusted with responsibilities under the PRP to work with and load nuclear weapons. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. His financial difficulties were generated when the economy became 
less stable and work diminished. The cost of fuel, repairs, and general overhead, 
increased, making it more difficult for him to maintain his monthly payments. Although 
he scrambled to keep everything going, he was forced to sell his assets and lay off 
employees to resolve his debts. Eventually, the business was shut down. Applicant had 
lost his trucks, his personal truck, as well as all of his other assets.  
Applicant sought any type of employment to make some money to pay his bills, 
for his only other income was his Navy pension. He lived with friends and worked any 
jobs he could find. He mowed lawns with a push mower, pumped septic tanks, and 
repaired vehicles. Applicant rejected bankruptcy. The vast majority of his debts have 
already been resolved, and other debts are in repayment plans. Applicant has either 
commenced making the required payments, or is about to do so. The status of the 
remaining accounts remains unclear, but it appears that Applicant is still attempting to 
resolve them. He obtained financial guidance from various sources. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions

under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:95 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
