Tuider, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges three delinquent debts. 
Department Counsel withdrew a SOR debt for $134. The largest SOR debt has been 
current for more than one year. On April 10, 2014, Applicant made a good-faith 
settlement offer to resolve the remaining debt. She made sufficient progress resolving 
her financial problems to mitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 13, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86) 
(GE 1). On October 30, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
On November 25, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing. On January 24, 2014, Department Counsel was ready to proceed 
on Applicant’s case. On February 24, 2014, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On 
March 6, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing 
notice, setting the hearing for March 26, 2014. Applicant acknowledged that she 
received at least 15 days’ notice of the date, time and location of the hearing. (Tr. 13-
14) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. (Tr. 6) At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant offered 29 exhibits. (Tr. 19-20, 69; GE 1-5; 
AE A-CC) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-CC. (Tr. 20, 69) 
On April 2, 2014, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. I held the record open, at 
Applicant’s request, until April 21, 2014. (Tr. 68, 70) On April 21, 2014, I received two 
exhibits from Applicant, which were admitted without objection. (AE DD-EE)  
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a, 
which is a debt for $134. (Tr. 12-13) There were no objections, and I granted 
Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 14) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, she admitted that at some point she owed 
the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b ($125,320) for a mortgage; however, she believed it was 
transferred to another bank and is included in her current mortgage.  She admitted she 
owed a debt to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c ($136,000 past due with a balance of 
$487,000); however, she received a mortgage modification, which is current under their 
agreement. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old manager of process management and integration, who 
has worked for the same defense contractor since 1982. (Tr. 21, 23) In 1974, she 
graduated from high school. (Tr. 22) In 2003, she received a bachelor’s of science 
degree in professional administration. (Tr. 22-23) She married in 1976, and her husband 
passed away in 1980. (Tr. 17, 25-26; GE 1) She had two children born of that marriage, 
who are 35 and 36 years old. (Tr. 17, 25-26; GE 1) She remarried in 1989, and she has 
a child of this marriage who is 23. (Tr. 17, 25-26; GE 1)

Applicant has not served in the armed forces. (Tr. 17, GE 1) She has held a 
security clearance for 27 years without a security-related incident or security violation. 
(Tr. 22) She disclosed that she had problems paying her mortgage on her December 
13, 2011 SF 86.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 1997, Applicant and her spouse purchased their residence for $145,000. (Tr. 
26, 30) In about 2004, the residence was repaired, remodeled, and enlarged, and the 
mortgage total was eventually increased to $420,000. (Tr. 32) The new mortgage 
payment was $2,800 each month. (Tr. 34) The $420,000 debt included a first mortgage 
of about $230,000, a second mortgage of about $90,000, and interest and charges after 
they missed payments in 2008 and 2009. (Tr. 42) In 2006, the house was appraised at 
$840,000, and the current appraisal is $330,000. (Tr. 43) The current mortgage balance 
owed is $576,000, which includes all legal fees. (Tr. 43-44; AE DD)  
 
In 2008, Applicant earned about $60,000, and her husband earned about 
$100,000 as an independent contractor. (Tr. 28-29, 40) In 2008, her husband became 
unemployed due to medical problems, and the family income went from $160,000 to 
$60,000. (Tr. 29, 38-40) If they paid the $2,800 mortgage, they would have a negative 
monthly net of $1,600 each month. (Tr. 46) They chose not to pay their mortgage. 
 
Applicant’s annual pay has increased from $60,000 in 2008 to $100,000 in 2014. 
(Tr. 47-48) Beginning in September 2012, they paid the SOR ¶ 1.c creditor $2,993 
monthly for one year, and they brought their mortgage to current status. (Tr. 47-48, 54, 
60; GE 2) For the last six months, they have been paying $3,300 monthly on their 
mortgage debt. (Tr. 50, 53, 60) Applicant borrowed $22,000 from her mother to assist 
with making their payments. (Tr. 49) The mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.c has been current 
since September 2012. (Tr. 61) 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for $125,230 originated from a home equity line of credit. 
Until recently, Applicant believed that this debt was incorporated into her primary 
mortgage debt because the amount of the primary mortgage was so large; however, 
she recently received a letter from the creditor offering to settle the debt for $30,000. 
(Tr. 56-57, 63) Applicant and her spouse were seeking a history of the mortgage and 
home equity line of credit from the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c to enable them to 
determine the status and amounts of those two debts. (Tr. 61) She acknowledged that 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c was unresolved. (Tr. 63-64) After the hearing, she provided an 
April 10, 2014 settlement offer made to the SOR ¶ 1.b creditor for $28,000, and an April 
15, 2014 response from the creditor indicating the settlement offer was under review.

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant is a good mother, daughter, and spouse, who volunteers at her church 
and generously cares for others and assists them. (AE B, C, D) A retired director, who 
has worked with and known her for over 25 years, lauded her hard work, motivation,

positive attitude, professionalism, productivity, and contributions to the mission of her 
employer and the DOD. (AE E) She received letters or certificates of recognition or 
excellence in June 1995, December 1995, October 1997, January 2001, February 2003, 
November 2005, March 2009, 2011, March 2012, October 2013, March 2014 and a 
plaque commemorating her contributions in honor of the 20th anniversary of Desert 
Storm. (AE F-K, N, P-T) She received November 2002 and March 2012 written thanks 
for her assistance and contributions and a November 1997 recommendation for 
employment. (AE L, M, O) Her evaluations over the last several years indicate her 
performance, ethics, values, leadership, and integrity were positive attributes in the “2-
meets,”“3-Exceeds,” or “4-Far Exceeds” categories with most ratings in the “3-Exceeds” 
and “4-Far Exceeds” classifications. (AE U-CC)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SF 
86, credit reports, SOR response, and hearing statement. Her SOR lists three 
delinquent or charged-off accounts totaling $612,364. Department Counsel withdrew 
one $134 SOR debt. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained the Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
                                            
2
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Applicant’s husband’s illness caused him to be unemployed in 2008, and the 
family’s annual income declined from $160,000 to $60,000, which constitute financial 
problems that were affected by circumstances largely beyond her control. Despite the 
magnitude of the reduction in the family’s income, only two debts became delinquent. 
Applicant and her husband negotiated a new payment plan on their mortgage,3 and 
made the necessary payments from September 2012 to the present. The debt in SOR ¶ 
1.b for $125,230 is currently unresolved. The creditor offered to settle the debt for 
$30,000, and Applicant counter-offered to settle the debt for $28,000. Based on 
Applicant’s track record of paying her debts, I am confident that Applicant will continue 
to negotiate and settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b.4  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable actions to resolve both of her SOR debts, establishing some good faith. AG 
¶¶ 20(c) and 20(e) are not applicable as she did not receive financial counseling or 
provide proof that she disputed her responsibility for any SOR debts.     
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts because of her husband’s illness and 
unemployment, resulting in two large delinquent debts. She has established her 
financial responsibility by bringing the largest debt to current status and negotiating in 
good faith to resolve the other debt. It is unlikely that financial problems will recur. Her 
efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. This 
determination should not be construed to mean more effort to resolve her remaining 
delinquent debt is unnecessary. Assuming financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are mitigated under the whole-person 
concept, infra.

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old manager of process management and integration, who 
has worked for the same defense contractor since 1982. In 2003, she received a 
bachelor’s of science degree in professional administration. She disclosed that she had 
problems paying her mortgage on her December 13, 2011 SF 86. She was awarded 
numerous certificates lauding her diligence, dedication, professionalism, and 
contributions to her employer and the DOD. Character references and performance 
evaluations support restoration of her access to classified information as they provide 
reliable indications that that she is a mature, responsible, and trustworthy person. She 
has held a security clearance for 27 years without a security-related incident or security 
violation. She deserves substantial credit for her contribution in support of the national 
defense. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States and her 
employer.  
 
Applicant’s husband’s illness and his loss of employment caused her family’s 
financial woes. Nevertheless, she acted responsibly under the circumstances by 
keeping all of her debts in current status except for two large debts. She paid about 
$40,000 in the last 12 months to keep her mortgage in current status, and she made a 
good-faith offer to resolve her remaining unresolved delinquent debt. Applicant’s 
progress over the last year shows she has acted responsibly to repair her finances. The 
Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial 
cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off

each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an 
applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his [or her] 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She has established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-
payment. Based on record evidence, I am confident she will pay her remaining 
delinquent SOR debt and avoid future delinquent debt.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole-person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
