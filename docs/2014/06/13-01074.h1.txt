GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) I/II/III (public 
trust position) is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 21, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Industry Division (CAF) issued her a set of 
interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on October 10, 2013.2 On an 
unspecified date, the DOD CAF issued her another set of interrogatories. She 
responded to the interrogatories on October 10, 2013.3 On November 19, 2013, the

DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September 
1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III 
position to support a contract with the DOD, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 25, 2013. In a sworn 
statement, dated December 11, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on March 26, 2014. The case was assigned to 
me on April 3, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 12, 2014, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on May 28, 2014.4  
 
During the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 6) and eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE G, including some with sub-categories) were 
admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) was received on June 5, 2014. I kept the record open to enable Applicant 
to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She submitted one 
additional document which was marked as AE H and admitted into evidence without 
objection. The record closed on June 2, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶ 1.a. 
through 1.f.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a data analyst since June 2013, and she is seeking to retain her eligibility for

 The Directive established that notification as to the date, time, and place of a hearing be furnished to an 
applicant at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, 
Department Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential date, time, and location long before 
the actual Notice of Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and 
the hearing was approximately 16 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant 
specifically waived the 15-day notice requirement. See, Tr. at 12.

occupying an ADP I/II/III position to support a contract with the DOD. In addition, since 
July 2013, she has held a part-time position with a county domestic violence shelter.5 In 
November 2013, she requested that her position with the shelter be made permanent 
with regular hours.6 Applicant received an associate’s degree in December 2004, and a 
bachelor of applied science degree in August 2012.7 Applicant previously worked in a 
variety of positions with different employers. She was in the operations department, an 
operations contractor, a shelter advocate, a user acceptance tester, and a part-time 
copy center associate. Applicant was unemployed from April 2007 until July 2007.8 She 
has never served with the U.S. military.9 She has never been married.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until April 2007, when she 
was fired for calling in sick too often and being late to the office.11 At the time, she was 
living “at the top of her means, possibly even beyond her means.”12 The absence of a 
salary resulted in an inability to maintain her monthly payments, and accounts started to 
become delinquent. After three months of unemployment, Applicant obtained a position 
with the county domestic violence shelter, paying $11 per hour.13 Her salary did not 
produce enough money to sufficiently cover her monthly accounts. She tried juggling 
her finances to attempt to be current, but was unable to do so.  
 
Applicant increased her work hours to generate additional income. She also went 
back to college to improve her resume in order to obtain a better-paying job that would 
allow her to pay off her bills.14 To reduce her expenses, in October 2007, Applicant 
moved back in with her parents.15 Despite her efforts, accounts remained or became 
delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or sold to debt purchasers. In 
February 2011, unable to resolve her delinquent debts, Applicant voluntarily filed a

petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.16 She listed 
$8,970 in total assets, including her automobile, $7,165 in secured claims (primarily her 
automobile), and $119,775 in unsecured nonpriority claims.17 At the time of her filing, 
Applicant had an average monthly income of $1,658.46 and average monthly expenses 
of $1,800, reflecting a monthly deficit of minus $141.54.18 Applicant’s unsecured 
nonpriority claims, except unspecified debts which were excepted from discharge (such 
as student loans), were discharged in June 2011.19 As a result of the bankruptcy 
discharge, with the exception of her student loans, Applicant’s financial situation was 
dramatically improved.  
 
Applicant subsequently incurred various medical bills for professional medical 
services provided by hospitals and physicians, and while most of the charges were 
covered by health insurance, Applicant was responsible for various unpaid amounts 
which she estimated to be $1,000.20 Several of the medical bills became delinquent and 
were placed for collection. In December 2013, Applicant indicated she was “working to 
contact all [of her] debt holders. . . to start settling [her] debts.”21 On March 2, 2014, 
Applicant started writing her medical creditors or collection agents seeking to set up 
repayment arrangements.22 One bill, in the amount of $125, was for service received in 
January 2013. Applicant indicated she would offer a monthly payment of $10 until the 
bill would be resolved by July 2014.23 Another bill, in the amount of $299.66, was also 
for service received in January 2013. Applicant indicated she would offer a periodic 
payment of $100 until the bill would be resolved in late June 2014.24 She has been 
making payments to various medical providers, or their respective collection agents, 
since January 2014.25 
 
Commencing in 2006, Applicant obtained several student loans from a variety of 
lenders. In March 2006, she obtained a $10,000 student loan from a bank.26 Applicant

defaulted on that loan, and in January 2009, $13,170.19 was charged off.27 In June 
2006, she obtained another $10,000 student loan from a different bank.28 Applicant 
defaulted on that loan, and in January 2008, $13,155.49 was charged off.29 Specific 
information pertaining to the original lender(s), amount(s), and date(s) of the other 
student loans was never established.  
 
The SOR identified five purportedly continuing student loan delinquencies as 
reflected by credit reports from June 2013,30 and September 2013,31 totaling 
approximately $46,133. Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly in these credit reports, in many instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. 
Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified 
by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in 
others eliminating other digits. Some accounts reflect no account number. Those debts 
listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, 
other evidence already in the case file, and Applicant’s submissions regarding the 
same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. – 1.d.) There are three separate student loan accounts with high 
credits of $11,049 (loan #0001), $11,173 (loan #0003), and $5,586 (loan #0004) with 
zero past-due balances as well as zero balances, as all three accounts were 
“transferred to recovery” with government claims filed.32 The identified creditor for the 
three accounts is not a lender or a loan servicer. It is a debt purchaser. The original 
lender is not identified. However, because of information regarding the dates the 
accounts were opened, it appears that loan #0001 pertains to the March 2006 loan and 
loan #0003 pertains to the June 2006 loan referred to above. As recently as December 
2013, a collection attorney had demanded $9,218.58 identified as the outstanding 
balance of another student loan that was purportedly generated from a different 
lender.33 The three accounts were also transferred or sold to another collection agent or 
debt purchaser claiming to represent the initial debt purchaser. By June 2013, the 
account balances had increased to $17,225, $17,740, and $9,167.34 In June 2013, 
Applicant told the OPM investigator that she would contact the original debt purchaser

to make repayment arrangements.35 Nearly another year passed when, in March 2014, 
Applicant requested information regarding the student loans in an effort to set up a 
repayment plan.36 In April 2014, the new collection agent demanded $36,148.90.37 In 
May 2014, a loan servicing company informed Applicant that loan #0001, in the amount 
of $13,651.66, had been sold by one debt purchaser to another debt purchaser.38 
Applicant has never made any payments on any of the three student loans.39 She never 
attempted to contact the U.S Department of Education (DOE) to determine the status of 
the student loans, and after the initial deferment period expired in January 2008, never 
sought forbearance or deferment on the loans.40 The accounts have not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e. – 1.f.) There are two separate student loan accounts with high 
credits of $13,200 (loan #91), and $5,125 (loan #92) with zero past-due balances as 
well as zero balances.41 It is unclear if the identified creditor for the two accounts is a 
lender, loan servicer, collection agent, or a debt purchaser. The original lender is not 
identified. However, because the dates listed for the opening of the two loans are April 
2006 and July 2006,42 it appears highly probable that loan #91 is the same loan as that 
identified above as loan #0001, and loan #92 is the same loan as that identified above 
as loan #0004. In June 2013, Applicant told the OPM investigator that she would 
contact the original debt purchaser to make repayment arrangements “in the near 
future.”43 She claimed she had difficulties locating the identified creditor or obtaining 
details regarding the loans.44 It is unclear if she ever actually contacted the identified 
creditor, for there is no documentation to indicate any such action on her part. The 
accounts no longer appear in her September 2013 credit report. Applicant has never 
made any payments on either of the two student loans.45 She never attempted to 
contact the DOE to determine the status of the student loans. After the initial deferment 
period expired, she has offered no evidence to indicate if she ever sought forbearance 
or deferment on the loans. The accounts have not been resolved. 
 
Applicant failed to present documentation from the National Student Loan Data 
System (NSLDS). Every student loan ever received by her, whether it was direct,

consolidated, subsidized, or unsubsidized, direct Stafford subsidized or unsubsidized, or 
Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), would be listed in the system. Those official 
records from the DOE would indicate if her student loans were in one of the following 
statuses: deferred, in forbearance, non-defaulted, paid in full through consolidation loan, 
cancelled, or in repayment. Such information would have been of assistance in guiding 
her to more meaningful and speedy resolution of the delinquent student loans. 
 
In June 2013, Applicant claimed she was current on all monthly obligations 
except for her student loans,46 a claim that has been proven not to be entirely accurate, 
considering her delinquent medical bills. In September 2013, she submitted a confusing 
personal financial statement indicating an annual net income of $30,540.78; monthly 
expenses of $1,742.25; zero debt payments; and an annual net remainder of $9,633.78 
available for discretionary use or savings.47 In May 2014, she submitted a revised 
budget which indicated a net monthly income of $3,133.46; monthly expenses, including 
repayments to her mother and her employer, of $2,132.32; debt payments, primarily for 
medical debts, of $531.39; and a monthly net remainder of $469.75 available for 
discretionary use or savings.48 After her current lease expires in October 2014, 
Applicant intends to relocate to her parent’s home where she will pay a monthly rent of 
$500, thereby saving herself approximately $255 in monthly rent, down from her current 
rent of $755.49  
 
When she filed for bankruptcy in February 2011, Applicant completed a required 
online course in credit counseling.50 She never sought assistance from the student aid 
office at her university, and never received any financial counseling dealing with debt 
management, loan consolidation, or repayment plans.51 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”52 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”53 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is

that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”54 DOD contractor personnel are 
afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made.55  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”56 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.57  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive

information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”58 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2007, Applicant found herself with insufficient funds 
to continue making her routine monthly payments. Various accounts became 
delinquent, and they were placed for collection, charged off, or sold. In February 2011, 
unable to resolve her delinquent debts, she filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, listing $119,775 in unsecured nonpriority claims. With the 
exception of her student loans, her debts were discharged in June 2011. New 
delinquent debts eventually occurred. The student loans went into, and remain in, 
default. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are

clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.59  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) only minimally applies. Applicant’s financial problems commenced in 
2007 when she was fired for calling in sick too often and being late to the office. 
Because she had previously been living at the top of her means, and possibly even 
beyond her means, her salary loss over a period of three months, resulted in an inability 
to continue paying her debts. After finally obtaining a new job, her reduced income did 
not ease her financial difficulties. The financial issues were left unresolved until 2011 
when she filed for bankruptcy. Although her non-student loan liabilities were discharged, 
Applicant eventually developed additional delinquencies, primarily associated with 
medical services. Although she had an estimated annual remainder of $9,633.78 in 
September 2013 available for discretionary use or savings, she failed to explain why 
she was unable to more quickly resolve her delinquent medical bills or her defaulted 
student loans. In May 2014, she had a net monthly remainder of $469.75, but aside 
from small medical payments, she failed to explain why she had not aggressively taken 
action to address the defaulted student loans. Applicant failed to act responsibly under 
the circumstances.60  
 
AG & 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred 
“so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” especially since those financial problems are 
continuing.  
 
AG & 20(c) minimally applies because, with the exception of the online credit 
counseling she received associated with her bankruptcy, Applicant has never received 
financial counseling or debt consolidation guidance. Furthermore, aside from the 
previously discharged debts, and some current small payments to medical providers, 
                                                          
59
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No.

there are no clear indications that her financial problems related to her student loans are 
being resolved or are under control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) very minimally applies because, until 2014, Applicant failed to initiate 
any effort, much less a “good-faith effort,” to start repaying any of her student loan 
creditors. She simply ignored them. She never attempted to contact the DOE to 
determine the status of the student loans. Even after the initial deferment period 
expired, she never sought forbearance or deferment on the loans. Applicant failed to 
search the NSLDS or other official records of the DOE to determine if her student loans 
were deferred, in forbearance, non-defaulted, paid in full through consolidation loan, 
cancelled, or in repayment. It is acknowledged that one of the problems with student 
loans is the common practice among student loan servicers in routinely transferring 
such loans among various loan-servicing companies in an effort to make the system 
more efficient, an action that creates confusion during the transition period. The practice 
also creates confusion in the manner in which credit reporting agencies report the status 
of such loans. Nevertheless, while some obstacles were created by the system, 
Applicant took no steps to resolve the situation. Over the years, Applicant did not act 
aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve her delinquent student loans. Instead, she 
generally ignored those debts. In May 2014, Applicant reported a monthly net remainder 
of $469.75 available to start paying some of her student loans. She has offered no 
evidence that she has done so. Some positive movements should have already taken 
place to resolve some of those delinquent student loans. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance or suitability for a public trust position by 
considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The 
administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance or suitability for a public trust position must be an overall commonsense 
judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person 
concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When 
confronted with unemployment and reduced income, Applicant obtained a part-time 
 
12 
                                      
 
position and worked diligently to increase her hours and salary. She tried to reduce her 
expenses and moved back with her parents until such time as she was able to earn 
more income. She went back to school to improve her resume in order to obtain a 
better-paying job. With the exception of her relatively brief period of unemployment, 
Applicant has generally been employed in either part-time or full-time positions. When 
she was unable to resolve nearly $120,000 in consumer debt, she filed for bankruptcy 
and had her non-student loan debt discharged. She has repeatedly declared her 
intention of resolving her delinquent accounts once she has the funds to do so.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. Applicant was, at one point, living beyond her means. She 
accumulated nearly $120,000 in consumer debt, and after several years of inability to 
resolve that debt, she filed for bankruptcy. While the unemployment and reduced 
earnings were circumstances somewhat beyond her control, with the exception of some 
minor medical debts, which she later allowed to become delinquent, Applicant did not 
make any efforts to address her defaulted student loans. She failed to seek guidance 
from the DOE or her school financial counselor. Instead, Applicant ignored her creditors, 
even after she had been questioned by the OPM investigator in June 2013. Her long-
standing failure to address her student loans, by either seeking deferment or 
forbearance, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about her 
fitness to hold a security clearance or a public trust position.  
 
I am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.61 The absence of any meaningful efforts or evidence to reflect actual 
payments to her student loan creditors is sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:62 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
                                                          
61
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely weak track record of making little or no 
efforts to address her student loans, and generally ignoring them until she is financially 
able to address them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions 
and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all 
these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising 
from her financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy an 
ADP I/II/III position to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility for public trust position 
is denied.
