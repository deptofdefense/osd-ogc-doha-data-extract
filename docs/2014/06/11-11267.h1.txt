GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 18, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Industry Division (CAF) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on May 28, 2013.2 On February 13, 
2014, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial

Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access 
to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 3, 2014. In a sworn 
statement, dated April 10, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge.3 On April 24, 2014, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on April 28, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 12, 2014. I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on May 28, 2014.4 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and ten 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on June 5, 2014. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted one additional document which was marked as Applicant 
exhibit AE K and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 2, 
2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶ 1.a. 
through 1.i.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor serving as a material 
specialist 3 lead with his current employer on a U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) base since 
August 2008. He was previously a bank wealth investment support specialist, a client 
support specialist, a part-time sales and student assistant, and a part-time Spanish tutor 
and computer lab assistant.5 He also went through periods of unemployment from 
February 2003 until August 2004, July 2006 until February 2007, and May 2008 until

 The Directive established that notification as to the date, time, and place of a hearing be furnished to an 
applicant at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, 
Department Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the 
actual Notice of Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and the 
hearing was approximately 15 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant 
specifically waived the 15-day notice requirement. See, Tr. at 11-12.

August 2008.6 With financial assistance received under the G.I. Bill, Applicant received 
an associate’s degree from a community college in December 2006.7  
 
Applicant enlisted in the USMC in February 1999, and remained on active duty 
until he was honorably discharged with the rank of lance corporal (E-3) in February 
2003.8 That same year he joined the USMC Inactive Reserve, and remained with that 
component until he was again honorably discharged in February 2007.9 Applicant has 
never been married and has no children. 
 
Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his active military service, Applicant was awarded the Marine Corps Good 
Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbon (two awards), the Meritorious Unit Commendation, a Letter of Commendation, 
and a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until May 2008. A series of 
events occurred commencing in 2003 or 2004 that contributed to the accumulation of 
about $38,000 in debt from credit cards, medical bills, school, and living expenses. He 
encountered the three periods of unemployment, obtained some part-time work, 
attended college full-time, and experienced an illness (a polyp was removed).11 As a 
result of his most recent period of unemployment, and because of insufficient money to 
continue making all of his monthly payments, some of his accounts became delinquent, 
placed for collection, or were charged off. 
 
While Applicant has held his current position since August 2008,12 it was not until 
about 2011 that he indicated he was “currently in the process of seeking out legal 
financial advice” to reorganize his delinquent debts by filing for bankruptcy under either 
Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, and looked forward to taking action to get his finances 
improved.13  In April 2014, he indicated that after resolving one non-SOR credit card

 In his SF 86 (GE 1, supra note 1, at 12), Applicant indicated he was hired by his current employer in 
August 2008, but in his Answer to the SOR, he stated he was hired in October 2008. Because the SF 86 entry was 
made in 2011 and the Answer to the SOR was issued in 2014, I have given greater weight to the information in the 
SF 86 as it was made closer to the actual date of hiring and would appear to be more reliable.

account in February 2013,14 he has “continued to save money in order to pay off [his] 
debt or seek financial counseling. Negotiating a settlement with the credit collection 
agencies has been difficult due to the high lump sum payment they seek and [he is] 
unable to afford at one time.”15 Applicant sought legal counseling and guidance from the 
employee assistance program (EAP) and was advised to consider bankruptcy as an 
option, an action he did not want to consider.16 Instead, Applicant intends to “save 
enough money to eventually resolve and settle” his debts.17  
 
The SOR identified nine purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by 
credit reports from June 2011,18 and March 2013,19 totaling approximately $41,461. 
Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these 
credit reports, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the 
same creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by 
complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in 
some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. 
Some accounts reflect no account number. Those debts listed in the SOR and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence already in the 
case file, and Applicant’s submissions regarding the same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a.-1.c.) There are three medical accounts with past-due balances in 
the amounts of $422, $432, and $1,987, which were placed for collection in 2011.20 The 
accounts were for medical services Applicant received in connection with his 2008 
surgery.21 He has not made any effort to approach the creditors to establish repayment 
plans, and he has not made any payments to any of the creditors.22 The accounts have 
not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a bank credit card account with a high credit and unpaid 
balance of $17,350 and a past-due balance of $2,918 that was closed by the creditor, 
placed for collection, and charged off in 2009.23 The account was apparently purchased 
by a debt buyer who increased the unpaid balance to $28,560.37, but offered to settle

the account for one payment of $13,560.38.24 Applicant used this credit card to pay for 
his routine living expenses. He contends he approached the original creditor but they 
demanded too much in a lump sum payment. He has not made any effort to approach 
the debt buyer to establish a repayment plan because he does not have sufficient funds 
to start making payments.25 The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) There is an internet and cable account with a high credit and past-
due balance of $214 that was placed for collection in 2010, with the unpaid balance 
increased to $364.26 He has not made any effort to approach the collection agent to 
establish a repayment plan because he does not have sufficient funds to start making 
payments.27 The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.) There is a bank credit card account with a high credit of $4,158 and 
a past due balance of $4,765 that was placed for collection and sold in 2011.28 The debt 
purchaser offered to settle the account for $1,713.90, but Applicant failed to take any 
action in response to the offer.29 Applicant used this credit card to pay for his routine 
living expenses. He has not made any effort to approach the creditor to establish a 
repayment plan because he does not have sufficient funds to start making payments.30 
The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.) There is a credit card account with a high credit and remaining 
unpaid balance of $2,274, as well as a past due balance of $1,501, that was placed for 
collection and charged off in 2010.31 The creditor offered to settle the account for 50% 
which was $47.38 per month over a period of 24 months.32 Applicant used this credit 
card to pay for his routine living expenses. He has not made any effort to approach the 
creditor to establish a repayment plan for three reasons: (1) he was advised by 
someone not to trust the creditor and to try to negotiate a settlement, (2) he feared that 
negotiating would restart the clock (apparently referring to the statute of limitations), and 
(3) because he does not have sufficient funds to start making payments.33 The account 
has not been resolved.

(SOR ¶¶ 1.h.-1.i.) There is a charge account with a large consumer electronics 
company with a high credit of $1,522 and an unpaid balance of $1,064 that was past 
due and sold to a debt purchaser in 2009.34 Applicant used the account to purchase a 
computer.35 The debt purchaser, claiming to be the original creditor, reported that the 
high credit, past-due amount, and unpaid balance were all $1,063.36 The account, listed 
in the name of the debt purchaser, does not appear in Applicant’s 2013 credit report. 
The account was subsequently resold to another debt purchaser that indicated the 
outstanding balance was actually $1,063.53, and offered to settle it for $372.24.37 
Applicant has not made any effort to approach the creditor to establish a repayment 
plan because he does not have sufficient funds to start making payments.38 The 
account has not been resolved. 
 
In May 2013, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS). 
Applicant’s monthly net income was $2,880. With monthly household expenses totaling 
$2,174, and no debt payments, he had approximately $706 available for discretionary 
spending of savings. He did not indicate that he had any savings.39 Applicant drives a 
2013 Nissan Sentra.40 During the hearing, Applicant indicated he had been able to save 
$1,000 since August 2008.41 He was asked to furnish a current PFS,42 but has 
apparently chosen not to do so.  
 
Applicant contends that he is current on all of his present accounts, including 
rent, utilities, and car payments, and that he has not accumulated any additional 
delinquent debts.43 Although he claimed to be saving money to be in a position to start 
resolving his debts, he apparently has only $1,000 in savings. Additionally, while he 
contends he has sought guidance and counseling from an attorney, the EAP, his union, 
and a financial counselor, in 2010 or 2011, his efforts came to a halt when he perceived 
the debt consolidation services to be a scam.44 With the exception of his May 2014

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Applicant has been recognized by management on several occasions for his 
personal commitment, dedication, and performance.45 He has been entrusted with a 
corporate credit card.46 Members of his corporate management have declined to furnish 
him with a letter of recommendation or character reference, claiming that they are not 
permitted to do so because they “are members of the management for the company 
that is trying to adjudicate his clearance application.”47 Applicant’s former supervisor, a 
friend and former colleague in the USMC, and coworkers, are very supportive of 
Applicant’s application for a security clearance. Applicant has been characterized in the 
following terms: trustworthy, exceptional work ethic, levelheaded self-starter, intelligent, 
articulate, effective, extremely knowledgeable, and integrity in all aspects of life.48 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in May 2008, Applicant found himself with insufficient 
funds to continue making his routine monthly payments, various accounts became 
delinquent, and they were placed for collection, charged off, or sold. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.55

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
 
10 
                                      
 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) only minimally applies. Applicant’s financial problems culminated in 
May 2008 after a series of events occurred that Applicant contends negatively impacted 
his finances. He noted that commencing in 2003 or 2004, he accumulated about 
$38,000 in debt from credit cards, medical bills, school, and living expenses. He also 
encountered the three periods of unemployment (February 2003 until August 2004, July 
2006 until February 2007, and May 2008 until August 2008), obtained some part-time 
work, attended college full-time, and experienced an illness for which medical insurance 
coverage was denied. While the periods of unemployment and the medical insurance 
issue may have contributed to some of his financial difficulties, the remaining issues 
have not been fully explained. Applicant received financial benefits under the G.I. Bill to 
enable him to pay his college tuition and living expenses. Applicant obtained his current 
position in August 2008, and he claims he generally has approximately $706 each 
month available for discretionary spending or savings. Yet, during the ensuing nearly six 
years since his full employment, he has been able to save only $1,000 (and purchase a 
2013 Nissan Sentra). Applicant’s financial issues were left unresolved. There is 
insufficient evidence that Applicant was unable to do more to pay his delinquent SOR 
debts. Applicant failed to act responsibly under the circumstances.56  
 
AG & 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2008, or even before that time, make it difficult to 
conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” especially since those 
financial problems are continuing.  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because there is only oral evidence, unsubstantiated 
by any documentation, that Applicant has ever received financial counseling or debt 
consolidation guidance. In addition, he failed to establish that there are clear indications 
that his finances are under control and his SOR debts are being paid. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply because Applicant failed to initiate a “good-faith 
effort,” to start repaying any of his SOR-creditors. There is evidence that he did resolve 
one non-SOR account. Applicant never made repayment arrangements, even for 
accounts as little as $364, $422, or $432. Creditors have reached out to him to settle 
some debts, with one creditor offering a repayment plan of $47.38 per month over 24 
months, but Applicant did nothing. Over the years since his full employment, Applicant 
did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

he ignored his debts and continues to do so, claiming he is saving money to eventually 
resolve and settle his debts. Applicant was previously a bank wealth investment support 
specialist, which would indicate some awareness of financial matters. In addition, when 
he noted that negotiating with one particular creditor would restart the clock, he was 
apparently referring to the statute of limitations for some of the debts that would be 
dropped from his credit report and become uncollectable once the statute of limitations 
had run its course. Applicant has been with his current employer since August 2008 – 
nearly six years – and more positive movements should have already taken place to 
resolve some of his delinquent accounts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He was 
honorably discharged from the USMC after serving on active duty and in the reserves. 
With the exception of his periods of unemployment, Applicant has generally been 
employed in either part-time or full-time positions. He completed his initial degree. He 
has repeatedly declared his intention of resolving his delinquent accounts once he has 
the funds to do so.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. While the unemployment and reduced earnings were 
circumstances beyond his control, Applicant either had no ability or no intention to pay 
his delinquent accounts. Aside from his one non-SOR creditor, he did not make any 
efforts to pay his creditors, generally ignoring them, even after he had acquired his 
current position in August 2008. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in 
reasonable amounts (such as $47.38 per month for 24 months), or to arrange payment 
plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.  
 
 
12 
                                      
 
I am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.57 The absence of any efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to his SOR 
creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:58 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a negative track record of making minimal efforts to 
pay his creditors, and generally ignoring them until he is financially able to address his 
delinquent debts.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions 
and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all 
these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
