MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has worked in the defense industry for almost 30 years as an inspector. 
She owes about $9,324 in delinquent consumer debt after an April 2009 Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge. The debt was incurred largely because of a marital separation. 
Applicant is making payments on her student loans, and she lives within her means. 
Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On November 6, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was 
unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security 
clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.

Applicant submitted an undated response to the SOR allegations. On December 19, 
2013, she requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). By letter dated March 5, 2014, Department Counsel 
provided discovery of the potential Government exhibits (GEs) to Applicant. On March 12, 
2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her. 
Scheduling the hearing was delayed because of travel and budget considerations for the 
Government. On May 12, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for June 4, 2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and two 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 16, 2014. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of November 6, 2013, Applicant owed 
$43,473 in delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.j): $10,730 was for utility service (SOR 1.a-1.e) and 
$32,743 was consumer credit debt (SOR 1.f-1.j). The SOR also alleges that Applicant was 
granted a Chapter 7 discharge in bankruptcy in April 2009 (SOR 1.k). When she answered 
the SOR allegations, Applicant denied two of the four natural gas debts alleged (SOR 1.a 
and 1.b), a propane account debt (SOR 1.e), the consumer credit debts (SOR 1.f -1.j), and 
the bankruptcy discharge (SOR 1.k.). However, Applicant also indicated that the assignee 
in SOR 1.h was collecting the debt in SOR 1.g, raising a reasonable inference that SOR 
1.g and 1.h are the same debt. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old inspector, who has worked for her current defense 
contractor employer since December 2003. She holds a Secret clearance, which was 
granted to her around December 2004. (GE 1; Tr. 23.) 
 
Applicant has two grown children, who are now age 35 and 34. She started her 
employment in the defense industry as an assembler/inspector with a defense contractor in 
October 1982. She was granted a DOD Confidential security clearance for her duties. (GE 
1; Tr. 24.)   
 
In April 2002, Applicant was laid off from her employment due to a lack of work. (GE 
1.) With almost 20 years on the job, she had been earning $26 an hour. (Tr. 50.) She was 
unemployed until July 2002, when she began working full time, at the prevailing minimum 
wage, as a charge-back analyst for a credit card company. In October 2002, Applicant took 
on a second job as a cashier with a retailer at minimum wage. (GE 1; Tr. 50.) She resigned 
 
 3 
from those jobs for her current employment. (GE 1.) Applicant’s starting wage with the 
defense contractor was between $16 and $17 an hour. (Tr. 50.) 
 
Applicant owned her home, a condominium which she purchased in 2001. Available 
credit report information shows that she paid off a $109,250 mortgage in October 2001, 
and that she continued to make payments as agreed on a $68,720 installment loan. In 
August 2003, she took on a new mortgage of $98,000. (GEs 3, 4.) 
 
Applicant fell behind on a consumer credit account (SOR 1.i) in late 2006. She 
continued to make her payments on other consumer credit accounts, including her 
mortgage. (GE 4.) In 2007, Applicant began taking online courses in criminal justice 
through a technical institute. (Tr. 51.) Available credit reports show that she took out 
student loan debt of $30,111.
1 
(GEs 3, 4.) 
 
Applicant and her spouse separated around May 2008, after she filed for a 
restraining order against him. Applicant filed for divorce.
2
 (GEs 1, 2.) Applicant stopped 
paying on a consumer credit account in January 2008 (SOR 1.f); on the credit card account 
in SOR 1.j in June 2008; and on her mortgage in August 2008. (GE 4.) Applicant paid her 
divorce attorney approximately $7,000 between 2008 and 2010 because of the protracted 
nature of her divorce proceedings. (GE 2.) She eventually terminated her divorce attorney’s 
services because she could not afford to pay him. (Tr. 22-26.) 
 
In December 2008, Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge.
3
 She listed 
two secured claims: the $96,544.10 mortgage balance on her condominium and $2,000 in 
unpaid condominium dues.  She listed non-priority, Schedule F claims totaling $36,191.66: 
 $2,133.20 in attorney fees for her divorce; $969.72 in electric utility debt for her 
condominium; a $16,904.42 balance on the account in SOR 1.i; and five credit card debts, 
including the debts in SOR 1.f and 1.j.
4 
(GE 1; AE B.) Applicant obtained credit counseling 
before she filed for her bankruptcy. She also took an online debtor education course after 
she filed. (AE A; Tr. 27.) In April 2009, she was granted a bankruptcy discharge. (GE 4.) In 
August 2009, a propane company placed a $306 debt for collection. (GE 3.) 
 
On October 29, 2009, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to the financial 
                                                 
1 
A credit report of June 11, 2011, shows Applicant opened four student loans totaling $27,777 in 2007. (GE 4.) 
As of September 2013, Equifax was reporting an additional student loan of $2,334, which was deferred. (GE 
3.) Applicant testified that she has five student loan accounts. (Tr. 45-46.) 
  
2 
According to Applicant’s e-QIP, she was married in December 2007 and separated around April 2008. (GE 
1.) She told the investigator she filed for divorce in May 2008, when her spouse moved out. (GE 2.) 
 
3 
Applicant paid her bankruptcy attorney around $1,000 for his services. (Tr. 61.) 
 
4 
Available credit information shows that Applicant owed a zero balance on the debt in SOR 1.f as of 
September 2008 after the debt was charged off and sold to another lender. (GEs 3, 4.) Applicant maintains 
that the account was included in her bankruptcy. (GEs 1, 2.) She included a $5,576.60 debt on her bankruptcy 
with a lender that does not appear on the credit reports. (GEs 3, 4.) It may well be the debt in SOR 1.f, which 
had a high credit of $5,723, but even if not, the debt has been charged off and is no longer legally collectible.  
 
 4 
record inquiries, Applicant reported that a loan and four credit card debts had been 
discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She also disclosed that condominium had gone into 
foreclosure. (GE 1.) 
 
 On February 1, 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed her bankruptcy, which 
she indicated covered all her debts, including her mortgage, condominium association 
dues, divorce attorney fees, the natural gas debt, an electric utility debt of $969.72, and her 
credit card debts. Applicant explained that she had to file for bankruptcy after she and her 
spouse separated in May 2008, and that most of the credit card debt was for her attorney 
fees. Applicant added that she was not certain about the status of her divorce. She had not 
contacted her divorce attorney in some time because she could not pay him, but she 
planned to contact him within the next week. About the foreclosure, which was initiated 
while she was in bankruptcy, Applicant indicated that she had tried without success to sell 
or lease her condominium. Applicant moved to her current state of residency in February 
2009, and the mortgage was dealt with through the bankruptcy. Applicant reported monthly 
net income after deductions of $2,440, monthly expenses of $1,800, and $100 in debt 
payments on her student loans. Applicant admitted that she was past due in her student 
loan payments, but she had a negotiated payment plan with her lender. (GE 2.) 
 
 On February 9, 2010, the investigator asked Applicant about delinquency dates for 
the accounts covered in her bankruptcy. She indicated that all the accounts except the 
mortgage went past due about five or six months before she filed. Applicant claimed that 
she stopped paying her mortgage when she filed for bankruptcy in December 2008. (GE 
2.) 
 
 As of June 11, 2011, the credit bureaus were reporting that her mortgage had been 
included in the bankruptcy, but also that her mortgage lender had redeemed the home to 
settle her mortgage. Applicant was 30 days late ($351 past due) on a $7,206 credit card 
balance (SOR 1.g). The account was opened in February 2011 and had a $7,000 credit 
limit. She reportedly owed a $306 balance on a propane debt in collection since April 
2009,
5
 although the credit report also indicated that the debt had been discharged. 
Applicant’s student loans were current, but they had been delinquent 150 days in the past. 
(GE 4.) 
 
 In September 2011, a natural gas provider placed two debts, of $1,672 and $1,154 
from July 2011, for collection. (GE 3.) Applicant had two separate accounts for gas service 
because she had a two-floor apartment with separate service for each floor. (Tr. 31-32.) As 
of February 2013, the accounts had respective outstanding balances of $2,474 (SOR 1.a 
and 1.c, same debt) and $2,211 (SOR 1.b and 1.d, same debt). (GE 3.) Applicant was 
billed for those balances, but she made no payments. (Tr. 32.) In April 2013, the gas 
company placed updated balances of $2,908 and $2,831 for collection. (GE 3.) 
 
                                                 
5 
Applicant testified to her belief that the debt had been included in her bankruptcy. (Tr. 34.) However, the debt 
is not listed on either the Schedule D or Schedule F in evidence. (AE B.) 
 
 
 5 
 As of September 2013, Applicant had made no payments toward the delinquent 
natural gas debts or the $306 propane debt (SOR 1.e). She had not received any bills for 
the updated balances of the natural gas debts (Tr. 32-33), although by then, she had 
moved from the residence where those costs were incurred. (GE 2.) The credit card 
account in SOR 1.g had been charged off and sold to the assignee in SOR 1.h. The debt 
was in collection with a reported balance of $3,279.
6
 Applicant was making payments on 
two accounts opened to rehabilitate her credit. She was paying $450 per month on a 
$21,811 automobile loan opened in August 2012, and about $25 per month on a low-limit 
($500) credit card account with a $518 balance. Both accounts were current as of August 
2013, but they had been past due 30 days in June 2013. Applicant was reportedly paying 
$100 a month toward her student loans, which had an aggregate balance of $19,995. She 
was behind $400 on one student loan account and $109 on another. (GE 3.) 
 
 In interrogatories dated September 10, 2013, the DOD CAF asked Applicant to 
update the payment status, if any, on the debts alleged in the SOR. On October 8, 2013, 
Applicant indicated that she owed only two of the four alleged natural gas debts; that the 
propane (SOR 1.e) and three of the consumer credit debts (SOR 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j) had been 
discharged in her bankruptcy; and that the $7,000 credit card debt in SOR 1.g was the 
same debt as the $3,279 collection debt in SOR 1.h. Applicant explained that she had 
reached a settlement with the assignee in SOR 1.h and had made payments on the debt 
before she could no longer afford to do so. She expressed her intent to consolidate her 
collection debt and her school loans so that she could make one, affordable monthly 
payment. Concerning any circumstances which could aid the DOD CAF to determine 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance, 
Applicant cited her defense contractor employment for about 30 years, and she attributed 
her financial issues to her efforts to divorce her husband. She admitted that she was “still 
trying to get [her] finances straight.” At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant completed a 
personal financial statement showing that her monthly expenses and debt payments ($450 
car payment and $65 toward her low-limit credit card) exceeded her net income by $18. 
She reported no assets other than her vehicle. (GE 2.) 
 
  Applicant’s hourly wage is presently $19. (Tr. 50.) She rents an in-law apartment 
from her father, and she pays her rent on time. (Tr. 43, 49.) Her father covers the utility 
costs. (Tr. 49.) She has about $100 in discretionary funds after she pays her monthly bills. 
Her student loan payment, of $50 a week as of June 2014, is being automatically deducted 
from her checking account. (Tr. 41, 45.) Applicant’s student loan balance is between 
$19,000 and $20,000 because of accrued interest on the unpaid principal. (Tr. 45.) The 
balance of her only open credit card account is about $400. (Tr. 42.) 
 
 As of early June 2014, Applicant had made no payments on her outstanding past-
due debt (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h). Applicant tried to borrow from her 401(k) account to 
pay her natural gas debts, in collection, but she was denied. (Tr. 48.) She plans to arrange 
repayment terms on those debts as soon as she has her student loans straightened out. 
(Tr. 44.) She has one new delinquency, a medical debt of $100, which is in collection. (Tr. 
37, 40.) 
                                                 
6 
Based on the account numbers (GE 3), the debts in SOR 1.g and 1.h are the same debt. 
 
 6 
 
 Applicant testified, with no evidence to the contrary, that she has never received any 
complaints at work or violated her security responsibilities. She has minimal access to “top 
security” material. (Tr. 29.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The SOR identified 10 purportedly delinquent accounts, totaling $43,473 in 
outstanding debt, after Applicant was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in April 
2009. Available bankruptcy records show that the consumer credit debts in SOR 1.i and 1.j, 
$18,242 of the total debt, were included in her bankruptcy. Applicant submits that the credit 
card debt of $4,231 alleged in SOR 1.f was discharged as well. The creditor was not 
named in her bankruptcy. However, the account was charged off and sold in 2008, and her 
bankruptcy included a $5,576 credit card debt not listed on her credit reports. Applicant 
could not confirm that the lender named in her bankruptcy purchased the debt in SOR 1.f. 
Even so, she did not owe an outstanding balance to the creditor in SOR 1.f as of the SOR. 
 
A propane debt of $306 (SOR 1.e) was placed for collection in May 2009. Applicant 
claims she included the debt in her bankruptcy, and her June 2011 credit report (GE 4) 
shows the debt as included. However, the debt was not listed on either her Schedule D or 
her Schedule F (AE B.) The debt appears on her credit record as an outstanding collection 
account as of November 2009, after her bankruptcy discharge. Applicant admits that she 
allowed two natural gas accounts to become seriously delinquent in 2011. As of June 
2013, collection balances on the two accounts totaled $5,739 (SOR 1.a and 1.b, duplicated 
in SOR 1.c and 1.d). The evidence establishes that as of June 2011, Applicant was past-
due $351 and $206 over her credit limit of $7,000 on the credit card account in SOR 1.g. 
The account was subsequently charged off and transferred or sold to the collection agency 
identified in SOR 1.h. As of August 2013, the unpaid balance was $3,279. AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” are established by Applicant’s record of financial delinquency. 
 
 Yet, several mitigating conditions apply, either in whole or in part. AG ¶ 20(e), “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the 
dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” is satisfied as to the debts 
alleged in SOR 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.g, and 1.i-1.j. The debts in SOR 1.c and 1.d are previous 
balances of the collection debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b and do not represent additional 
balances. The credit card debt in SOR 1.f was charged off and sold. It is legally 
uncollectible, even assuming it was not included in her bankruptcy. The credit card debt in 
SOR 1.g was transferred to the collection agency in SOR 1.h, and the debts in SOR 1.i and 
 
 8 
1.j were discharged in her bankruptcy. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply to the delinquencies 
which were owed as of the SOR and are still unpaid (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h).  
 
 AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current, reliability, or good judgment,” applies in that the debts are not recent. The credit 
card debts in SOR 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j were incurred between 2006 and 2008, and they were 
either charged off or discharged in her December 2008 bankruptcy. The natural gas (SOR 
1.a and 1.b) and propane (SOR 1.e) debts were incurred about five years ago. Those 
debts, as well as the credit card debt in collection (SOR 1.h) remain unpaid, but the debts 
are attributable to her pending divorce and not to circumstances that reflect adversely on 
her judgment and reliability. 
 
 Marital separation and divorce are mitigating conditions that could trigger AG ¶ 
20(b): 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant’s June 2011 credit report shows that Applicant paid several consumer credit 
accounts on time, including the mortgage on her condominium, before she and her spouse 
separated in May 2008. A few accounts were shown to be delinquent before her 
separation: a $995 consumer credit debt (not alleged) with a last payment in December 
2007 and included in her bankruptcy; the account in SOR 1.f, which was transferred after 
no payment since January 2008; and the account in SOR 1.i, with November 2006 as the 
date of both account opening and last activity. However, her separation and divorce filing 
had a negative impact on her finances in that she paid her divorce attorney around $7,000 
before she terminated his representation because she could not afford to pay him. These 
unexpected costs implicate AG ¶ 20(b). Loss of spousal income could be a factor under 
AG ¶ 20(b), but Applicant did not present any evidence in this regard. 
 
 For AG ¶ 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant must show that she acted reasonably under 
the circumstances. While Applicant did not provide any details about her marriage, a 
restraining order suggests an abusive relationship. Since May 2008, Applicant has had to 
support herself on an hourly wage between $17 and $19 an hour. When she had no 
success in selling or renting out her condominium, she turned to bankruptcy. While the 
effect of her Chapter 7 discharge was to leave most of her creditors without a legal remedy 
(her mortgage lender apparently redeemed her property), bankruptcy is a legal means to 
address her debts. She indicated in response to the interrogatories that she had reached a 
settlement with the agency collecting SOR 1.h, and that she had made some payments 
until she moved and could no longer afford to do so. Her September 2013 credit report 
shows September 2011 as the date of last activity on the account. She tried to obtain a 
loan from her 401(k) to address her $5,739 in natural gas debts. Applicant does not have 
repayment arrangements in place for the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, or 1.h, but she is 
 
 9 
paying on her student loans. She is being responsible, given her circumstances. AG ¶ 
20(b) applies. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” are both implicated. Applicant received financial counseling as 
required for her bankruptcy discharge. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy is not a substitute for 
payments, but it is understandable in her circumstances. Her candor about her financial 
delinquencies and her bankruptcy on her e-QIP enable me to accept her uncorroborated 
testimony that she tried in good faith to obtain a loan from her 401(k) to resolve her 
delinquent natural gas debts. Yet, it is difficult to fully apply either AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d) 
without recent efforts by her to settle or satisfy her outstanding delinquencies (SOR 1.a, 
1.b, 1.e, and 1.h). 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
7
 
 
Applicant’s financial difficulties are attributed to the dissolution of her marriage and 
not to excessive spending. Her largest debt is for student loans, which she took out in 2007 
to pay for online studies. When she and her spouse separated, she had the burden of 
repaying about $30,000 in student loan debt and a $96,544 mortgage on an hourly wage 
that was between $17 and $19 an hour. She ran up consumer credit balances paying for 
her divorce attorney without procuring a final decree of divorce because her spouse gave 
her “a hard time.” (Tr. 22.) After a bankruptcy discharge and transfers of some debts, 
Applicant still owes delinquent debt balances totaling about $9,324. 
 
In making the whole-person assessment required under the Directive, the DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to 
resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant testified credibly to her intent 
to arrange settlements or repayment of the natural gas debts ($5,739 of the $9,324 total) 
as soon as she has her student loans straightened out. (Tr. 44.) Albeit 150 days behind in 
her student loans at one point, she made payments to reduce her student loan debt to

The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

$19,995 as of September 2013. As of June 2014, she was paying $50 a week toward her 
student loans. Applicant plans to consolidate them to lower the interest paid on the 
accounts. 
 
Certainly, Applicant would have a better case in mitigation had she repayment plans 
in place for her $9,324 in old delinquent debt. In her favor, she lives within her means and 
is handling her current obligations responsibly. For the most part, she has paid her car 
loan, rent, and credit card balance on time. Her student loan payments are being 
automatically withdrawn from her checking account. On her present hourly wage of $19, 
she has at most $100 in discretionary income at the end of the month, so the prospect of 
resolving her past-due debts in the near future is low, unless she is able to borrow the 
funds or manages to reduce her monthly student loan payment obligation. She has worked 
in the defense industry for almost 30 years, the past ten with her current employer, with no 
evidence of any security violations. Security clearance decisions are not intended as 
punishment for past shortcomings. Nor do they demand perfection. Applicant is not seen 
as likely to jeopardize the employment which she needs to maintain to be able to meet her 
present financial obligations and to address less than $10,000 in past-due debt. After 
reviewing the facts and circumstances before me, I conclude that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance eligibility at this time.
