HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny his eligibility 
for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. He has not resolved the 
charged-off, collection, or delinquent accounts alleged in the Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), which total more than $45,000. The financial considerations security concerns 
remain. Clearance is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
 
 Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1 on March 6, 2013, 
the DoD issued an SOR detailing security concerns. DoD adjudicators could not find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD 
on September 1, 2006.

security clearance. In an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. On February 6, 2014, I was assigned the case. On March 26, 
2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing 
for the hearing convened on April 16, 2014. I admitted Government’s Exhibits (Ex) 1 
through 7 and Applicant’s Exhibit A, without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing. 
The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit additional information. Timely 
submitted documents were admitted as Ex. B through Ex. K. On April 25, 2014, DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he denied three delinquent accounts and 
admitted the 20 remaining factual allegations in the SOR, and his admissions are 
incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I 
make the following findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 50-year-old field engineer who has worked for a defense contractor 
since March 2012, and seeks to obtain a security clearance. Applicant called no 
witnesses other than himself and produced no documents related to work performance 
or character references. In 1996, Applicant and his wife divorced for a year and then 
remarried.2 (Tr. 14, 27) His wife and three children, ages 15, 21, and 23, live with him. 
His wife is a postal system supervisor with 19 years of service. (Tr. 27) Applicant’s 
hourly wage is $32. (Ex. 2, Tr. 24) His annual salary is approximately $68,000 and his 
wife’s annual salary is approximately $64,000. (Tr. 49) He believes his net monthly 
remainder (monthly gross income less deductions, monthly expenses, and debt 
payments) is approximately $1,800. (Tr. 50)  
 
 The SOR lists 21 charged-off, collection, or delinquent accounts, which total 
$57,197. Applicant denies three delinquent accounts (SOR 1. I $519, 1.j $433, and 1.n 
$3,085), which total $4,037. Additionally, he asserted in his SOR response that the car 
debt in SOR 1.h ($7,849) is the same debt as listed in SOR 1.k ($8,561). The 
uncontested and non-duplicated delinquent accounts exceed $45,000.  
 
 In 1999, Applicant purchased a home. He experienced serious problems with his 
mortgage lender. (Tr. 20, 21) After six month, the loan was sold to a new company, but 
Applicant was never informed of the sale and kept making his payment to the initial 
mortgage lender. (Tr. 30) The payments were never forwarded to the new mortgage 
creditor. Applicant had to file two lawsuits before the matter was corrected. He is current 
on his mortgage payments and utility bills. (Tr. 32) He has payments on a 2008 Toyota 
Tundra. (Ex. D, H) In 2013, he purchased a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro for $31,000, with 
$632 monthly payments. (Tr. 32, 49) His combined vehicle payments are $1,100 
monthly. (Tr. 32)  
 
                                                          
2 Applicant initially said he remarried after a year’s separation and also stated the remarriage may have 
occurred in 2000. (Tr. 39)  
3 
 
  Applicant did not timely file or pay his federal3 income tax for tax years 1994, 
1996, 1997, 2001, or 2003 (SOR 1.l). In March 2007, he was required to file his past 
due federal returns when he petitioned for bankruptcy protection. He owed $19,773 
(SOR 1.b) in delinquent tax. (Ex. 2) In his August 2011 Personal Subject Interviews 
(PSIs), he stated he had been paying $700 monthly on the tax debt since February 
2011. He never documented this assertion. At the hearing, he stated his wife is paying 
$500 monthly on her tax debt, which is not his account. (Tr. 24, 38) As of May 2013, 
federal tax of $22,3804 is owed with a $500 monthly payment due on May 28, 2013. 
(Ex. K) Applicant provided no evidence of payments made to the IRS.  
 
Applicant did not file his 1994, 1996, and 1997 tax returns due to irresponsibility. 
(Tr. 37) He did not file his 2001, 2003, and 2007 returns because he was trying to keep 
his home. (Tr. 37) At the time, he was struggling to make his house payments. (Tr. 37) 
Three or four times in the past, the IRS has garnished his pay and taken money from 
his bank account. (Tr. 39) The IRS has intercepted all anticipated tax refunds. (Tr. 40)  
 
 In March 2007, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection (SOR 1.a). 
(Ex. 3) The filing included real property assets of $96,902 and personal property assets 
of $22,025 for a combined total of $118,927 and total liabilities of $120,507. (Ex. 3) At 
the time of filing, Applicant’s monthly household income was $5,546 and monthly 
expenditures were $3,570. (Ex.3) On August 12, 2009, the bankruptcy was dismissed5 
because he failed to make the required monthly payments. He was $6,846 delinquent at 
the time the bankruptcy was dismissed. Additionally, his check to the Trustee was 
returned due to insufficient funds. (Ex. 3) During the course of the bankruptcy, he paid 
$28,037 on his mortgage and $1,000 on his vehicle. The other creditors received 
nothing.  
 
 Applicant asserted his bankruptcy attorney (SOR 1.n, $3,085) had been paid. 
The bankruptcy documents indicate $10,850 in administration expenses for the 
bankruptcy had been paid. (Ex. 2) However, there is no indication these fees cover the 
bankruptcy attorney’s fee. He also asserted some of the SOR debts were listed in his 
bankruptcy. These debts (SOR 1.o, $195; SOR 1.q, $274; SOR 1.r, $1,029; and SOR 
1.w, $97) remain valid debts since the bankruptcy was dismissed and not discharged. 
(Tr. 46, 47, 48)  
                                                          
3 Applicant is a resident of a state that does not have a state income tax. 
 
4 At the hearing, Applicant stated he believed the balance owed the IRS was $26,000. (Tr. 40) 
5 If a Chapter 13 plan is dismissed, creditors may immediately initiate or continue with state court litigation 
pursuant to applicable state law to foreclose on the petitioner's property or garnish their income. If a 
bankruptcy case is dismissed, the legal affect is that the bankruptcy is deemed void. If a Chapter 13 plan 
is completed successfully, the petitioner will earn a discharge. Discharge means that all debt listed in the 
Chapter 13 plan is satisfied; and therefore, creditors may not pursue additional collection actions pursuant 
to applicable state law.  
 
4 
 
 In 2005, Applicant purchased a 2000 Ford Explorer for $21,475, which was later 
repossessed. (Ex. 2, 3, Tr. 28) In July 2005, following the repossession of the vehicle, 
the creditor charged off $7,849 (SOR 1.h). In August 2005, the charged-off amount 
increased to $8,561. (Ex. 3) A $9,511 debt was included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. 
(Ex. 3) The creditor received $1,040 during the bankruptcy for this debt. (Ex. 3)  
 
 In April 2006, Applicant spent seven days in an intensive care unit for a strep 
infection. (Ex. 2) After leaving the hospital, he was required to remain at home for four 
months for additional monitoring. (Ex. 2) While hospitalized, he was laid off from work 
due to a reduction in force (RIF). He received $4,000 in severance pay. (Ex. 2) In May 
2006, he started his own business. (Tr. 2) He used funds from his 401(k) retirement 
plan until they were expended. (Tr. 23) In 2013, Applicant received a $105,000 payment 
for work he had done in his sole proprietorship. (Ex. 2, Tr. 40, 50) He used 
approximately $15,000 to pay bills and the balance went back into the business, and an 
amount was set aside to pay taxes. (Tr. 41) He has done no sole proprietorship work 
during the last year. (Tr. 51)  
 
In 2007, Applicant’s home suffered $9,000 in hurricane damage to his roof, 
fence, and sheet rock. His insurance company paid only $6,000 of the damage. (Ex. 2)  
 
 Applicant paid a $480 charged-off utility bill (SOR 1.d). (Ex. A, Ex. F) A $519 debt 
(SOR 1.i) is listed as paid in his August 2011 credit report. (Ex. 4, Tr. 35) In December 
2001, he entered into an agreement to settle the debt listed in SOR 1.p ($1,334) for 
$300. (Ex. G) He provided documentation showing payment in accord with this 
agreement. (Ex. I)  
 
In July 2013, Applicant made a $1,146 payment to a law firm collecting on an 
educational loan (SOR 1.c, $4,584). He documented no other payment on this debt and 
did not document that the payment was in response to an offer of settlement. He also 
documented a $112 payment in January 2003 to the creditor listed in SOR 1.s ($1,290) 
and 1.t ($336). He did not establish this single payment was in response to a settlement 
offer by this creditor. He asserted, but failed to document, that the two student loans 
listed in SOR 1.u ($1,788) and 1.v ($1,138) were his wife’s loans. (Tr. 54)  
 
 Applicant asserted that the vehicle debt showing in SOR 1.h ($7,849), SOR 1.k 
($8,561), and SOR 1.m ($3,724) were all the same debt. However, he provided no 
documentation showing all three debts are related to the same vehicle purchase or that 
the debt was paid. He stated he “had a couple of other vehicles repossessed, but that 
was well over ten years ago.” (Tr. 42) He had no knowledge about the vehicle 
repossessed in SOR 1.m ($3,724), which remains unpaid. (Tr. 43) 
 
Applicant asserted, but failed to document, that the following debts had been 
paid: SOR 1.e ($101), SOR 1.f ($610), SOR 1.j ($433), 1.q ($274), (Tr. 35, 36) He did 
not assert the SOR 1.g ($545) had been paid. 
 
5 
 
 During the hearing, the SOR debts were reviewed and Applicant was informed 
which debts would need additional documentation to support his assertions that the 
debts were paid. (Tr. 52) He was informed additional documentation was needed for the 
debts listed in: SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 
1.u, and 1.v. (Tr. 52-54) No evidence of current payment was received. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the interests of security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
6 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. In 2007, Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy protection. He failed to timely file his federal income tax returns and to timely 
pay his tax for six years. Additionally, he owes in excess of $22,000 in federal tax. He 
owns in excess of $25,000 on other charged-off, collection, and delinquent accounts. 
Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” AG ¶ 
19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” and AG ¶ 19(g), “failure to file 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of 
the same, apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
7 
 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 None of the mitigating conditions fully mitigate Applicant’s financial 
considerations security concerns. His financial difficulties are both recent and multiple. 
In 2006, eight years ago, he was hospitalized and suffered a RIF at work. Additionally, 
he was divorced from his wife for a period of time starting in 1996. He also experienced 
problems with his mortgage payments caused by the mortgage lender.  
 
Applicant has received no credit or financial counseling. He has not 
demonstrated that his financial problems are under control or that he has a plan to bring 
them under control. His evidence is insufficient to show he has made a good-faith effort 
to satisfy his debts. He asserts he has paid the majority of the SOR debts, but failed to 
document his claim. He was made aware of the Government’s concern about his 
finances during his August 2011 PSIs, in the December 2012 written financial 
interrogatories, and by the March 2013 SOR. Even though his and his wife annual 
income is approximately $132,000, Applicant only documented a single payment of 
$1,146 payment on the $4,584 debt, since receiving the SOR in March 2013. 
 
At the hearing, Applicant was informed of the need to document the payment of 
the SOR debts. He provided documents to show that the three debts listed in SOR 1.d 
($481), 1.i ($519), and 1.p ($1,334) were paid. He documented the $1,146 payment 
mentioned in the prior paragraph, and, in August 2005, made a $548 payment on the 
$8,561 debt. The debts in SOR 1.h and 1.k are duplications of the same debt.  
 
Because Applicant has multiple delinquent debts and his financial problems are 
ongoing in nature, the mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
Applicant’s handling of his finances, under the circumstances, casts doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Likewise, he receives partial 
8 
 
application of the mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(b), for in 2006, he was 
hospitalized, he and his wife were divorced for a period of time starting in 1996, and lost 
his job. There is little evidence of the effect these events eight years ago have on 
Applicant’s current ability to address his delinquent debts. He has been employed in his 
current job since April 2011. He has had a sufficient opportunity to address his financial 
delinquencies. He has failed to act timely or responsibly under the circumstances and 
has failed to resolve his debts or significantly reduce his delinquent debts.  
 
Good-faith requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Even if 
Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his control, it must still be considered whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.6 
  
The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because Applicant 
has not received financial counseling, nor is there an indication he has resolved his 
delinquent obligations. The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(d) applies to the three 
debts he paid. It does not apply to the other debts because, to date, Applicant’s efforts 
to address his delinquent accounts have been minimal. There is no documentary 
evidence to support his assertions that he paid the majority of the SOR debts. There is 
no evidence to show he has had recent contact with his creditors or evidence he has 
tried to establish repayment plans. Applicant has failed to act aggressively, timely, or 
responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts.  
 
The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant 
has not provided documented proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

(App. Bd. November 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. December 1, 1999).

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There is some evidence in favor of 
mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 2006, Applicant was hospitalized, lost his job due to a 
RIF, and, in 1996, divorced his wife. Also, two lawsuits were required to force the 
mortgage holder to properly handle his mortgage.  
 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the RIF, divorce, and problems with his mortgage company were circumstances 
beyond his control, he has done little to address his long-standing delinquent accounts. 
The Applicant’s annual gross household income is $132,000 and the only documented 
payment he made after receiving the March 2013 SOR was the $1,146 payment made 
in July 2013. There is no showing that a single payment satisfied the debt in SOR 1.c. 
His long-standing failure to repay his creditors or to arrange repayment plans reflects 
traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. 
 
The concept of “meaningful track record” includes evidence of actual debt 
reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required to establish 
that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is for him 
to demonstrate he has established a plan to resolve his delinquent debt and has taken 
significant action to implement that plan. I must reasonably consider the entirety of 
Applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that plan 
is credible and realistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all 
outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan may provide for payment 
on such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
The issue is not simply whether all Applicant’s debts have been paid – they have 
not – it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a 
security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:   Against Applicant 
10 
 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant    
  Subparagraphs 1.e - 1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i:  For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.j – 1.o:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.p:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.q – 1.w:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
