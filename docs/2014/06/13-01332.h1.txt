Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He did not present sufficient evidence to
mitigate the financial considerations security concern stemming from his ongoing
financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On February 6, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.    
Applicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2014. Neither Applicant nor
Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the
written record.2
On April 17, 2014, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material
information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant material3
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it May 10, 2014. Applicant replied to the
FORM in a timely manner, and his six-page reply is made part of the record as Exhibit
A. The case was assigned to me June 9, 2014.   
Ruling on Evidence
Exhibit 5 contains, among other things, a report of investigation (ROI) from the
background investigation of Applicant. The 11-page ROI is a summary of an interview of
Applicant in February 2013. Under the rules that govern these cases, an ROI may be
received and considered as evidence when it is authenticated by a witness.  The ROI is4
properly authenticated via authenticating interrogatories answered by Applicant. (Exhibit
5 at 12, 25). Accordingly, the ROI is admissible.  
Findings of Fact
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted having ten collection or charge-off
accounts for a total of about $12,000. His admissions are accepted, adopted, and
incorporated as findings of fact. 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for his job as a security guard. To that end, he submitted a security clearance
application in November 2012. (Exhibit 4) He is married and has minor children. His

employment history includes honorable service while on active duty in the U.S. Navy
during 1999–2005.  
There is substantial evidence to support the SOR allegations that Applicant has a
history of financial problems. Along with his admissions, the delinquent accounts are
established by credit reports from September 2013 and November 2012. (Exhibits 6 and
7) The ten accounts are unresolved, as Applicant has not provided documentation
showing they are paid, settled, in a payment plan, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise
resolved. 
In his reply to the FORM, Applicant submitted documentation showing that he
had received settlement offers for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Exhibit A at 2–3)
But he did not submit documentation showing actual proof of payment per those offers.
He also asserted that the account in SOR ¶ 1.a was duplicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f. I
examined the credit reports and find that those three accounts are separate and distinct
accounts, and Applicant did not provide documentation showing otherwise. Finally, he
asserted the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j were settled or will be settled
in the near future, but provided no documentation to support his assertion. To reiterate,
based on the available information, the ten accounts in the SOR are unresolved. 
 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As5
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt6
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An7
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  8

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting9
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An10
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate11
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme12
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it15
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant16
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 17

Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  18
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history—the ten delinquent debts that are
unresolved—indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not19
meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two20
disqualifying conditions.  
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  I have considered all six21
in light of the facts and circumstances here, and none, individually or in combination,
are sufficient to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. In reaching this
conclusion, I specifically considered Applicant’s periods of unemployment and
underemployment. (Exhibit 5 at 10, 12) The available information shows that Applicant
has taken little affirmative action to resolve his delinquent debts. His promises to pay in
the future and his good intentions are not sufficient to apply any of the mitigating
conditions. 
With that said, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or
enforcing tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment,22
reliability, and trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In
evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant

 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).24
6
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.23
Based on the available evidence, Applicant has not taken enough significant
actions to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. In light of the facts and
circumstances here, the record evidence presents uncertainty, and that uncertainty
equates to doubt about Applicant’s fitness for access to classified information. 
After weighing the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating
the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant did not present24
sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the Guideline F security concern.
Accordingly, Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.j: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
