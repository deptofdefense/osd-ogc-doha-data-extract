Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his security
clearance to work in the defense industry. A 37-year-old field engineer, Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties. He met his burden to present sufficient
evidence to explain and mitigate the financial considerations security concern.
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a security clearance application on
December 8, 2011.  After reviewing the application and information gathered during a1
background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD), on April 11, 2014, sent
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,2
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action2
under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant
answered the SOR on May 30, 2014, and he subsequently requested a hearing on
September 8, 2014.       
The case was assigned to me October 1, 2014, to conduct the hearing requested
by Applicant. The hearing was held as scheduled on October 29, 2014. The transcript
(Tr.) was received November 6, 2014. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security
clearance. He is employed as a field engineer for a federal contractor. His current
annual salary is about $65,000, although he anticipates an across-the-board pay cut at
his company. He has held this job since about August 2010.  He was honorably3
discharged from active duty in the U.S. Army at the end of March 2010,  and he was4
then unemployed until he started his current job.  
Applicant has served approximately 16 years active and reserve duty in the U.S.
military. His military service includes a deployment to Bosnia in 1999, and deployments
to Iraq with one of the Army’s combat divisions during 2004–2005, 2006–2007, and
2009–2010.  He stated that he was subject to direct fire on eight to ten occasions, he5
was never wounded or injured, and he is not suffering from PTSD or a similar condition.
He has a claim pending for service-connected disability compensation with the
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
The SOR alleges and there is substantial evidence to show that Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties.  In his answer to the SOR, he admitted each6
of the debts alleged. The delinquent debts are grouped together and discussed as
follows: (1) back taxes owed to the IRS for $21,192 and $14,498 for tax years 2011 and
2012, respectively; (2) a $9,817 collection account stemming from the purchase of a
water purification system; and (3) six miscellaneous accounts consisting of a $76 past-

due account, four charged-off accounts for a total of $3,584, and a $697 collection
account.  
(1) The back taxes owed the IRS for tax years 2011 and 2012 are alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Applicant explained this indebtedness is the result of his overseas
deployments in support of the U.S. armed forces as a defense contractor during
2011–2012. He worked in Iraq in 2011 and in Afghanistan in 2012. During the
deployments he earned a higher income and received other benefits (e.g., danger pay)
that resulted in a higher taxable income. For example, his taxable income in 2012 was
nearly $110,000, which is far more than he earned as an active duty soldier.  Moreover,7
insufficient funds were withheld for tax payments. Before 2011-2012, he had no tax
problems; he submitted IRS account transcripts for tax years 2008–2010 that reflect
zero balances and no outstanding or irregular matters.8
Applicant realized he was out of his depth and sought professional advice and
assistance to resolve the back taxes. In September 2013, he retained the services of a
firm specializing in tax matters.  Working with a CPA, Applicant submitted an offer in9
compromise to the IRS the same month. The IRS denied the offer in compromise in
May 2014, and sent the case back for collection.  10
Applicant and the CPA then provided additional financial information to the IRS to
establish a repayment agreement. In September 2014, the IRS accepted the offer to
enter into a direct debit installment agreement, with the first monthly payment of $110 to
be deducted on October 28, 2014.  Before the agreement was accepted, he made11
payments of $110 in July, August, and September 2014.  In addition, he timely filed his12
2013 federal income tax return, which resulted in a refund of $1,736.  The refund was13
applied to the balance for tax year 2011.14
(2) SOR ¶ 1.d alleged the $9,817 collection account, which is still outstanding.
Applicant explained the debt stems from the purchase of a water purification system.15

He and his then wife bought the system for the benefit of a child who has a skin
condition that requires pure water. The system stopped working, and Applicant was
unable to get the system repaired, replaced, or removed, and so he stopped paying on
the account. He has been in telephone contact with the creditor, a finance company, but
he has been unable to enter into a settlement agreement with terms he can meet. In the
meantime, he is making $100 monthly payments on the debt until such time as he has
sufficient funds to settle the account.
(3) The six miscellaneous accounts consisting of a $76 past-due account, four
charged-off accounts for a total of $3,584, and a $697 collection account are alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e–1.i. These accounts are resolved. Applicant provided extensive
documentation showing the accounts were paid or settled.16
In addition to the above matters, Applicant provided proof of payment for a
collection account not alleged in the SOR, but which formed the basis for an adverse
incident report to security officials in 2011.  The last payment was made in July 2012,17
and the account now has paid-in-full charge-off status. 
Applicant is divorced from his first wife, with whom he has two minor children. He
pays child support at the rate of $870 monthly. He stated that he is current with the child
support, which is deducted from his pay check, as well as other recurring monthly bills.
He stated that he is now more careful with his money, he no longer uses credit cards,
and he saves cash if he wants to make a sizeable purchase. He intends to sell or rent
the former marital home, which should make additional money available for debt
repayment. 
At the hearing, Applicant was serious and respectful, and he answered questions
without equivocation. I was favorably impressed by Applicant and had no concerns
about his credibility. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As18
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the

side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt19
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An20
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  21
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting22
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An23
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate24
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  25
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s26
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.27
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a

person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it28
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant29
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 30
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  31
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning32 33
of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions,
and the facts also suggest a degree of inattention or irresponsibility.
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and34
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).35
7
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved and is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(a) applies because Applicant’s tax problems
occurred in the limited period of tax years 2011–2012 when he was working as a
defense contractor overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is a circumstance that is
unlikely to recur. Moreover, it does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current security
suitability because he has entered into a repayment agreement  with the IRS to resolve
the back taxes.   
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(c) applies because there are clear indications
that Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved and are under control.
Importantly, Applicant is not incurring new delinquent debt. He has also taken steps to
reduce his delinquent debt. He entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS to
resolve the back taxes, he is making monthly payments on the unresolved collection
account, which he hopes to settle, and he paid or settled the six miscellaneous
accounts. Taken together, these circumstances show a favorable upward trend.
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(d) applies under essentially the same
rationale as discussed above for AG ¶ 20(c).
Applicant’s financial record is less than perfect. But the evidence also supports a
conclusion that he has established a meaningful track record through actual debt
reduction. He also has a plan to resolve the back taxes and the remaining collection
account and has taken steps to implement that plan. 
Applicant’s history of financial problems does not justify current doubt about his
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  In particular, I considered Applicant’s35
multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, as both a soldier and a contractor, as
significant in my analysis. Applicant’s willingness to go in harms way on behalf of his
country is highly favorable evidence. Accordingly, I conclude that he has met his
8
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.i: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
