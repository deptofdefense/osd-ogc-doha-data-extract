GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 23, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On March 21, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn statement, dated May 
14, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on August 20, 2014. The case was assigned to me on August 21, 2014. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on August 27, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on September 17, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and seven 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE G) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 30, 2014. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted three additional documents, which were marked as exhibits 
AE H through AE J and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
September 30, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s answers and 
explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
February 2013, he has served as a network consultant engineer.2 Applicant graduated 
from high school in 1993.3 In 1998, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering.4 Applicant was married in September 2006.5 He and his wife have a 
daughter born in 2008 and a son born in 2011.6 Applicant has never served with the 
U.S. military.7 He has never held a security clearance.8

Financial Considerations 
In July 2006, Applicant purchased a residence financed by a home loan of 
$445,640 and a private loan of $70,000 from his wife’s aunt. In December 2006, he 
acquired a home equity loan for $130,000, in part to repay the aunt and in part to pay 
down the first mortgage and to purchase appliances and furniture for the house.9 There 
was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2009, and he routinely made his 
monthly payments for both loans until that time.10 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In January 2009, Applicant invested in an existing laundromat with 
an unemployed former business colleague as his business partner.11 He used some of 
his savings as well as an open credit line of approximately $50,000 for the purchase of 
equipment and supplies. Applicant was listed as the account’s primary user and his 
partner was the secondary user.12 Although the laundromat was not making any profit, it 
remained open until January 2011 when it was sold “pretty much for nothing.”13 Since 
Applicant’s business partner was unable to pay his half of their joint business debt, 
Applicant became responsible for the entire balance. He continued making substantial 
monthly payments ($1,180 in July 2011 and August 2011) on the account until the 
balance diminished to $46,520.65.14 Applicant closed the account, and on September 
30, 2011, that amount was charged off.15 The charged-off balance was transferred to 
another account in October 2011, and Applicant continued to make routine monthly 
payments of between $400 and $500 each month.16 On April 1, 2014, Applicant and the 
creditor agreed to a formal repayment plan under which Applicant is to continue making 
monthly payments of $400 until the account is paid in full.17 As of April 10, 2014, the 
remaining account balance was $34,070.65.18 By August 25, 2014, the remaining 
balance was reduced to $32,070.65.19 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
In February 2009, Applicant’s employer laid off Applicant and the remaining 
members of his team, eventually closing the entire department in which they worked, for

financial reasons.20 He remained unemployed until July 2009.21 As a result of the layoff, 
in April 2009 he started falling behind in his monthly home loan payments.22 During his 
layoff, Applicant called both his primary mortgage lender and his home equity lender in 
an attempt to work on a resolution for his financial problems. The home equity lender 
advised him to focus on the primary mortgage.23 Applicant eventually stopped paying 
the home equity account.24  
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): When Applicant obtained his new job in July 2009, that job paid 
him 20 percent less than the one he had previously lost, leaving him that much less to 
make his monthly payments.25 The primary mortgage lender initially refused to enter 
into a current mortgage modification program or to accept any monthly payments until 
Applicant first paid off his past-due balance.26 A new trial mortgage modification 
program was established in 2010, and Applicant was permitted to enroll in it for six 
months. Under that program, Applicant’s past-due balance was rolled back to the end of 
his loan. After completing the trial program, Applicant was informed by the mortgage 
lender that his interest rate would be increased substantially to a rate he could not 
afford.27 In 2013, foreclosure proceedings were commenced.28 At about the same time, 
the primary mortgage lender informed Applicant about a new mortgage modification 
program for which he appeared to be qualified, and after an exhaustive period of 
verifications and interviews, Applicant was entered into that program.29 The foreclosure 
process ceased and Applicant was given new terms on his mortgage. Effective 
February 2014, he has been making monthly payments of $2,706.34.30 Applicant’s 
primary mortgage account is back to a current status. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): In October 2012, the bank that extended Applicant his home equity 
loan cancelled the $124,933.89 debt and issued him a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of 
Debt.31 Normally, debt forgiveness results in taxable income. However, under the 
Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, during tax years 2007 through 2012, as

a homeowner, Applicant was able to exclude up to $2 million of debt forgiven on his 
principal residence.32 The account has been resolved. 
During the period April 2009 to July 2009, Applicant met with financial 
representatives of both his primary mortgage lender and his home equity lender. He 
revealed all of his assets and liabilities and his financial picture underwent a detailed 
analysis. He was also referred to a third-party non-profit financial counselor for 
additional guidance in budgeting.33 In September 2014, Applicant prepared a family 
monthly budget. A review of that document reveals a total monthly income of $7,480, 
including salary and rental income from two properties. With routine monthly living 
expenses and educational savings of $6,727, he estimated that he has approximately 
$1,028 available for discretionary spending or savings.34 Applicant has two rental 
properties, about $12,000 in savings, $3,000 in checking, $50,000 in his 401(k), and 
$40,000 in restricted stock options.35 All of Applicant’s newer accounts are current.36 
Applicant’s FICO® credit score is 700, reflecting a “good” borrower.37 It is Applicant’s 
goal to address each of his accounts in turn to pay them off.38 
Work Performance and Character References 
 An individual who has known Applicant for over 23 years has characterized 
Applicant as an upstanding citizen and proactive member of the community, as well as 
a highly professional and trustworthy person.39 A co-worker, who has known Applicant 
since 2006, noted that Applicant is a trusted friend and co-worker, and he has 
“demonstrated a strong work ethic, balanced perspective, and measured responses to 
challenging situations.”40 Applicant is active in his community church with child-related 
programs.41

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”42 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”46 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s most significant financial problems arose in 2009 and 
continued for several years thereafter. He was unable to continue making some of his 
routine monthly payments, and one credit card, one mortgage, and one home equity 
loan became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. The 
mortgage went into a foreclosure status. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.

8 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.48  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties, occurring 
in 2009, make it difficult to conclude that they occurred “so long ago” or were “so 
infrequent” as to make them unlikely to recur. Applicant’s financial problems were not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. 
Instead, his financial problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. In February 
2009, Applicant’s employer laid off Applicant and the remaining members of his team, 
eventually closing the entire department in which they worked, for financial reasons. He 
remained unemployed until July 2009. When he was able to obtain new employment, 
the salary was 20 percent less than his old salary. As a result of that lay-off and reduced 
salary, he was unable to continue making routine monthly payments on some of his 
accounts. Exacerbating his financial difficulties, Applicant’s investment business, the 
laundromat, was not making a profit, and when it was sold, Applicant’s business partner 
was unable to be responsible for paying his share of their business debt.    
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his three delinquent accounts and 
working with his creditors in an effort to set up repayment arrangements or otherwise 
resolve them.49 His overall strategy has been successful, and he has resolved two of 
                                                          
48
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
49
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when

the accounts and is in the process of resolving the remaining account. The residence 
was withdrawn from foreclosure status, and the account is now current. Applicant 
worked with financial counselors to assist him in obtaining the home mortgage 
modification and had his financial status analyzed. He has funds available each month 
for discretionary spending or savings. All of Applicant’s newer accounts are current. 
There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.50 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.51       
There is little evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of his 
finances permitted three accounts to become delinquent. As a result, those accounts 
became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. His mortgage 
eventually entered a foreclosure status. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is much more 
substantial. He has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and

beyond his means. Rather, Applicant’s problems were largely beyond his control. In 
February 2009, Applicant’s employer laid Applicant off and eventually closed the entire 
department in which he worked, for financial reasons. Applicant remained unemployed 
until July 2009, and when he obtained new employment, the salary was 20 percent less 
than his old salary. The lay-off and the reduced salary made it difficult for him to 
continue making routine monthly payments on some of his accounts. In addition, when 
Applicant’s unsuccessful investment business was sold, Applicant took responsibility for 
paying both his and his business partner’s portions of their joint business debt.    
Applicant did not ignore his debts. Instead, he addressed them. Applicant 
eventually saw his mortgage withdrawn from foreclosure status, and with an approved 
loan modification, the mortgage is once again current. He set up repayment 
arrangements on the delinquent business account. As a result of the Mortgage 
Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, Applicant’s delinquent home equity loan was 
forgiven, and he no longer has any legal responsibility for it. Accordingly, Applicant has 
resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all three of his accounts. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:52 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I

conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
