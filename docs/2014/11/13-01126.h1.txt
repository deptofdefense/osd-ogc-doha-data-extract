Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems, which
includes an ongoing Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. He did not present sufficient evidence
to mitigate the financial considerations security concern stemming from his ongoing
financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted an application for a security clearance on
December 9, 2013. After reviewing the application and the information gathered during
a background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD), on March 7, 2014, sent
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action1
under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.    
Applicant answered the SOR on March 25, 2014. Neither Applicant nor
Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the
written record.2
On September 3, 2014, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material
information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant material3
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it September 9, 2014. Applicant did not
reply to the FORM within the 30-day period allowed under the Directive. The case was
assigned to me November 3, 2014.   
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for his job as a test technician. According to his security clearance application, (1) he is
married and has two adult children; (2) he has worked full-time for his current employer
since November 2010; (3) he was unemployed for two months in 2010; (4) he had full-
time employment as an electronic systems technician during 1986–2010; and (5) he has
had a part-time job as a high-school coach since early 2011.  Applicant and his wife had4
gross income of approximately $105,343 in 2011, $101,044 in 2012, and $109,257 in
2013.  They have an average monthly gross income of approximately $9,068 in 2014,5
which equates to about $108,816 annually.6
There is substantial evidence to support the SOR allegations that Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties. In general terms, the delinquent debts listed
in the SOR consist of the following: (1) eight unreleased state tax liens for a total of
$4,912; (2) two unsatisfied judgments for a total of $6,048; (3) two student loans for a

total of $65,741; and (4) four collection accounts for a total of $1,299. In addition, the
SOR alleged failure to pay federal income taxes for tax years 2005–2009 as well as
$26,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS. Finally, the SOR alleged Applicant filed a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in January 2014. 
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations except for a
$3,703 judgment, which he denied. He also stated that he is disputing the judgment and
submitted documentation of the dispute through a credit bureau. In addition to his
admissions, the SOR allegations are established by credit reports  and bankruptcy court7
records.  He further explained the financial difficulties as follows:8
Our decision to file bankruptcy was to make sure our creditors would get
paid in a timely manner. Our financial difficulties were due to several
periods of unemployment, a few large medical bills and our lack of an
emergency savings account or emergency credit cards. We did NOT want
to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, because we did not want to walk away from
our debt and financial responsibilities. We wanted to make sure they were
taken care of and paid, and we felt like Chapter 13 would help organize
our debt and making payment via our bankruptcy attorney would ensure
our creditors were getting paid on time without incurring more debt and
fees.9
The bankruptcy court records shed further light on Applicant’s financial
problems.  Applicant and his wife stated they had $288,915 in total assets and10
$551,239 in total liabilities. A few of the liabilities are mentioned below.
Schedule D lists creditors holding secured claims. It shows that the IRS filed a
lien in April 2003 for $40,276. 
Schedule E lists creditors holding unsecured priority claims. It shows Applicant
owes the IRS $41,766 in back taxes for tax years 2003–2013. 
Schedule F lists creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (commonly known
as unsecured debt). It shows Applicant owes a total of $289,422 to numerous creditors.
The vast majority of the debt, approximately $281,181, is for multiple student loan
accounts.

The proposed payment plan calls for Applicant and his wife to pay $1,927
monthly for 60 months (five years). In addition, tax refunds for tax years 2013, 2014,
and 2015 may be paid into the plan. 
Applicant did not submit documentation showing the Chapter 13 payment plan
was approved and confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Likewise, he did not submit
documentation showing a record of monthly payments under the plan. And other than a
two-month period of unemployment in 2010 (as stated in his security clearance
application), he did not submit documentation showing periods of unemployment as
stated in his answer to the SOR.  
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17

burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant22
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 23
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  24

Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The state tax liens,25 26
the back taxes owed to the IRS, the student loan accounts, and the collection accounts
are  more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.   
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  I have considered all six27
in light of the facts and circumstances here, and none, individually or in combination,
are sufficient to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. With that said,
Applicant is credited with disputing the unsatisfied judgment in SOR ¶ 1.g. He also
receives credit for taking action to resolve his financial problems under a Chapter 13
payment plan. That is a step in the right direction, and it is certainly a better option than
walking away from his indebtedness under Chapter 7. But the credit in mitigation is
minimal, because there is no evidence before me that the bankruptcy court approved
the plan and that Applicant has made monthly payments per the plan.  
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and28
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement

 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).30

that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.29
Based on the available evidence, Applicant has not taken enough significant
actions to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. There is no track record of
Applicant adhering to the Chapter 13 payment plan and I cannot assume that he has
made such payments. In light of the facts and circumstances here, the evidence
presents uncertainty, and that uncertainty equates to doubt about Applicant’s fitness for
access to classified information. 
After weighing the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating
the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant did not present30
sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the Guideline F security concern.
Accordingly, Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.h–1.s: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
