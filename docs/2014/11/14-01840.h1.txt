GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 30, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On June 18, 2014, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under

Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on July 7, 2014. On an unspecified date, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on 
August 28, 2014. The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2014. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on October 14, 2014, amended on October 20, 2014, and I 
convened the hearing by video teleconference, as scheduled, on October 31, 2014.2 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and one 
Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and 
four other witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 10, 2014. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted ten additional documents which were marked as AE B 
through AE K and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
November 14, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e.). He denied one 
allegation (¶ 1.c.), contending it was a duplicate of another allegation, and was unable 
to address the remaining allegation (¶ 1.f.) as he could not identify the creditor from any 
information furnished by the Government or from any other source. At one point during 
the hearing, the Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing SOR ¶ 
1.f. There being no objection, the SOR was amended and the allegation was 
withdrawn.3 Applicant’s answers and explanations are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
September 2006, he has served as a network administrator.4 Applicant was

 The Directive established that notification as to the date, time, and place of a hearing be furnished to an 
applicant at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, 
Department Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the 
actual Notice of Hearing was issued. The Notice of Hearing was issued on October 14, 2014, and Applicant 
acknowledged receipt of the Notice on October 15, 2014. The Amended Notice of Hearing was issued on October 20, 
2014, and Applicant acknowledged receipt of the Amended Notice that same day. Thus, the period between the 
issuance of the Notice and the hearing was approximately 17 days, and the period between the issuance of the 
Amended Notice and the hearing was approximately 11 days. I inquired of Applicant if he had any objection to 
proceeding and he responded “no.” See, Tr. at 15-17.

unemployed on several occasions for a variety of reasons: from August 2001 until 
January 2004 as a result of job-related injuries; from September 2005 until October 
2005 when his employer was beset by Hurricane Katrina-related damage; and from 
August 2006 until September 2006 while relocating to a new residence when his wife’s 
military deployment ended.5  
 
He served on active duty in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Air Force from 
September 1991 until December 1991, and was transferred to the Air Force Reserve 
where he remained until September 1999. Because Applicant’s weight apparently 
exceeded Air Force standards, he was entered into the Air Force Weight Management 
Program.6 Although Applicant lost weight while in the program, he failed to lose 
sufficient weight to become successful.7 As a result, his initial unit commander refused 
to allow him to drill because he was overweight, and his next unit commander 
processed him for discharge for failure to drill and missing too many sessions.8 
Applicant was initially issued a general discharge under honorable conditions, but the 
characterization of the discharge was eventually upgraded to an honorable discharge.9 
Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in August 1991.10  
 
Applicant attended a community college from August 2001 until May 2003, and 
was awarded an associate’s degree in applied science in May 2003.11 He was married 
in December 1994, and he and his wife have two children, a son born in 1994, and a 
daughter born in 1996.12  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2012 or 2013. 
Applicant attributed most of his financial problems to difficulties obtaining rent on a 
rental property, on the budget sequestration in 2013 during which his wife, a registered 
civilian nurse with the U.S. Navy as well as a U.S. Army Reservist, lost 20 percent of 
her salary, and the sequestration’s impact on his own salary. He also noted that his 
residence had sustained significant damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina in August

 Although the height and weight of an individual are measured under the program, a significant 
consideration is the body fat percentage of any individual who exceeds their maximum allowable weight, and who 
appears to exceed the body fat standard, or who doesn’t present a professional military appearance.

2005, and that while insurance covered most of the damage, he did not receive any 
government assistance.13 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): From April 1997 until mid-2012, Applicant resided in one particular 
house, the one which had sustained the hurricane damage. When he eventually 
vacated it and moved into another residence, he rented his old residence to a niece and 
her family. After the lease was signed, Applicant’s monthly mortgage payment 
increased, but Applicant simply absorbed responsibility for the extra amount each 
month thereafter. Applicant’s niece was unable to work for several months, and in 
September 2012, her child passed away. Applicant helped with the funeral 
arrangements and received no rent payment that month. Thus, he found himself 
responsible for the mortgage payments on two houses (his own residence and the 
rental property) and that put him in a bind with his other accounts. Applicant’s niece and 
her husband both work, and they have been paying rent, albeit sometimes late, each 
month since October 2012.14 As a result of receiving late rent payments, Applicant has 
been making some late mortgage payments.  
As of November 2013, his account was 30 days or $979 past due.15 In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated the arrearage would be cleared up before 
August 15, 2014.16 However, during the hearing, he acknowledged he was still 
delinquent on a little over one full payment.17 His niece also informed him that she 
would make two payments in November 2014 in an effort to bring the account current.18 
It has been a continuing struggle for Applicant to make his monthly payments, for it 
seems that shortly after he makes one payment, the next payment is due.19 
Nevertheless, since January 2014, Applicant has routinely made his monthly mortgage 
payments of $951.91 or $859.44, depending on the required payment specified by the 
lender.20 There is no documentary evidence that Applicant’s niece had yet made her 
two rent payments. Nevertheless, it appears that the account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.): Applicant obtained student loans when he was attending 
college. The loans, totaling what he thought was about $10,800, were deferred for some 
time after he graduated. He made monthly payments of $150 for an unspecified period, 
and in early 2012, he stopped those payments when he received a collection notice. He

immediately called the loan servicing organization to determine what had happened 
because he had been making his monthly payments. He then learned that his student 
loans had not been consolidated as he had thought, and that he had been making 
payments on only one student loan.21 Applicant’s November 2013 credit report reflects 
two separate student loans in collection, totaling $13,358.22 In December 2013, 
Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a repayment/rehabilitation plan under 
which Applicant was to make monthly payments of $100 for his student loans, which at 
that point had a balance of $13,396.79.23 He made his monthly payments and the 
student loans were rehabilitated and transferred.24 The accounts have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a credit card with a credit limit of $5,000 and a remaining 
balance of $4,794 that was 90 days past due in the amount of $557.25 In September 
2013, Applicant stated he was paying the creditor $150 bi-weekly until November 2013, 
at which time he would start paying $125 per month.26 During the hearing, Applicant 
acknowledged that he had not complied with the agreement because he was falling 
behind with some other bills, so he stopped any automatic payments. He could not 
recall if he made any such payments.27 On November 12, 2014, the collection agent 
agreed to a new repayment plan under which it would electronically debit $100 each 
month from Applicant’s checking account. The initial such payment is to be made on 
December 12, 2014.28 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a credit card with a credit limit of $500 and a remaining 
balance of $506 that was 30 days past due in the amount of $65.29 In September 2013, 
Applicant stated that the account became delinquent “a few times” when he forgot to 
make a payment, but that the account was now current.30 In his Answer to the SOR, he 
admitted the account was still delinquent, and he promised to pay the account in full 
before August 15, 2014.31 During the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he had not

paid off the account and that there was still a balance.32 On November 7, 2014, 
Applicant paid the creditor the final $342.89.33 The account has not been resolved. 
Applicant started receiving financial counseling in early November 2014, and 
there will be another meeting in 30 days to review his spending diary and determine the 
effectiveness of his overall payment plan.34 As part of his counseling, Applicant 
established a monthly household budget. A review of the document reveals a total 
family monthly net income of $7,207. With routine monthly living expenses and debt 
obligations of $6,888.07, he has an estimated $318.93 available for discretionary 
spending or savings.35 With the exception of an installment agreement Applicant and his 
wife have with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid income taxes, all his other 
accounts are now current. He estimates that a loan will be taken from his wife’s Thrift 
Savings Plan (TSP) in December to pay off the income tax balance.36 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s former supervisor has known Applicant for eight to ten years as their 
relationship evolved from a manager, co-worker, to friend and pastor. He evaluated 
Applicant’s work performance. He characterized Applicant as honest, reliable, and 
professionally skilled.37 One of Applicant’s co-workers has known him professionally for 
eight years. She characterized him as very reliable, honest, and trustworthy.38 
Applicant’s mother and wife noted that he is honest, loyal, and a very good father, and 
that he is very involved in his church and community.39 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”40 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”41   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”42 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.43  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”44

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”45 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although Applicant experienced a drain on his resources as early as 
2001, his most significant financial problems arose in 2012 or 2013.  He was unable to 
continue making his routine monthly payments, and various accounts became 
delinquent and were placed for collection. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
45
 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.

mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.46  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. As noted above, Applicant’s initial 
financial problems started in August 2001 and lasted until January 2004 as a result of 
unemployment occasioned by job-related injuries. Additional financial problems 
occurred in September 2005 and October 2005 when his employer sustained Hurricane 
Katrina-caused damage. When Applicant’s wife’s military deployment ended in 2006, 
they relocated and he was again unemployed for two months. Applicant apparently 
overcame those earlier financial problems, only to be confronted by new ones. His 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Instead, his more recent financial problems were also 
largely beyond Applicant’s control. Applicant attributed his financial problems to a 
variety of causes, including the death of his niece’s child, the assistance he gave her 
with funeral arrangements, her initial inability to pay rent on the house he was renting to 
her and her family, the increased post-rental agreement mortgage payments, and her 
subsequent late payments. There was also the misunderstanding regarding the failure 
to consolidate his student loans, and his mistaken belief that he was making monthly 
payments for consolidated loans when, in fact, he was only making payments on one 
loan.  
Applicant approached his creditors in an effort to set up repayment 
arrangements. While some of those efforts resulted in initial failures to comply with the 
conditions of the arrangements, Applicant’s overall repayment strategy has been 
successful, and he has resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all of his delinquent 
debts.  
He is receiving counseling from a financial counselor, and the counselor is 
guiding him on how to pay some of his accounts and how to reduce his debt. All of 
Applicant’s newer accounts are current. A review of his monthly household budget 
reveals that he now has approximately $318.93 each month available for discretionary 
spending or savings. Applicant acted responsibly by addressing all of his delinquent 
                                                          
46
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

accounts, and working with his creditors.47 There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.48 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.49       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, various 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. He 
has an outstanding reputation in the workplace and in the community. Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely beyond Applicant’s 
control. He helped his niece financially when he could really not afford to do so. 
Applicant has resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all of the accounts identified in

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

the SOR, as well as one not listed in the SOR. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:50 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.51 Overall, the evidence 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28,

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Withdrawn  
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
