HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 10 delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts totaling $18,233. He filed his federal and state income tax returns 
from 2008 to 2012 in 2012 and 2013, and his taxes are current. He made sufficient 
progress resolving his financial problems, and financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated. He disclosed his financial problems on his January 4, 2012 Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance 
application (SF 86), and personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 4, 2012, Applicant submitted an SF 86. (GE 1) On April 29, 2014, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) as revised by 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence on August 30, 2006, which became 
effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On May 23, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 12, 2014. On 
August 25, 2014, the case was assigned to me. On September 9, 2014, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, and on September 
17, 2014, issued an amended notice of hearing, both setting the hearing for October 2, 
2014. The hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 
days of notice of date, time, and location of the hearing. (Tr. 15) Department Counsel 
offered six exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 23; GE 1-6) The 
transcript was received on October 10, 2014. Applicant provided eight exhibits to 
Department Counsel on October 20, 2014, which were in turn, provided to me on 
October 24, 2014, and admitted without objection on October 24, 2014. (AE A-H)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted in full or in part the allegations in SOR 
¶¶ 1.c, 1.k, 1.l, 2.a, and 2.b. He denied the other SOR allegations, and he provided 
some extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old information technology professional, who has worked 
for a defense contractor for the previous three years. (Tr. 31) In 1983, he graduated 
from high school. (Tr. 7) In 2004, he was awarded a bachelor’s of science degree in 
computer networking. (Tr. 8) He served on active duty in the Marine Corps for one year 
and for five years in the reserves as a wireman. (Tr. 8-9) He left the Marine Corps as a 
corporal (E-4), and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8)   
 
Applicant married in 1994, and he was divorced in 2008. (Tr. 68) His children are 
ages 14, 15, and 17. (Tr. 69) There is no evidence of security violations, criminal 
conduct, use of illegal drugs, or alcohol abuse.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR allege ten delinquent, collection, or charged-
off accounts totaling $18,233 as follows: (1) and (2) ¶¶ 1.a ($1,387) and 1.b ($878) are 
telecommunications collection accounts owed to the same creditor; (3) ¶ 1.c ($7,217) is 
a charged-off bank debt; (4) ¶ 1.d ($1,599) is a charged-off bank debt; (5) ¶ 1.e ($3,023) 
is a charged-off bank debt; (6) and (7) ¶¶ 1.f ($701) and 1.g ($1,083) are bank collection

debts owed to the same creditor; (8) ¶ 1.h ($76) is a laundry-related collection bank 
debt; (9) ¶ 1.i ($285) is a medical-collection debt; and (10) 1.j ($1,944) is a medical-
collection debt. (HE 2)  
 
Applicant was unemployed from September 2008 to March 2009. (Tr. 32, 34) He 
was previously unemployed in 2003. (Tr. 33) He had financial problems, and some 
debts became delinquent while he was unemployed. (Tr. 33) In 2009, he moved to a 
different state, and many of his bills were not forwarded to his new address. His current 
annual pay is about $75,000. (Tr. 32)   
 
Applicant said he disputed the telecommunications debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($1,387) 
and 1.b ($878), and that they do not appear on his December 2013 and April 2014 
credit reports. (Tr. 36-40; AE D, H) Applicant said he contacted the creditor for the credit 
card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c in 2012 and 2013, and the creditor advised they were unable to 
find a record of the account. (Tr. 40-41) 
 
In December 2013, Applicant paid $825 to the creditor holding the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.d ($1,599), and the debt was resolved. (Tr. 41-43; AE F, H) For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e 
($3,023), he said he had been paying the creditor $180 monthly for more than two 
years, and he had reduced the debt from $6,000 to $743. (Tr. 44-45; AE E, H) 
 
Applicant did not do anything to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($701) and 1.g 
($1,083) which were owed to the same creditor; however, Applicant noted the two debts 
did not appear on his credit report. (Tr. 48-49) On February 2, 2012, he paid the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($76), and his current credit report indicates the debt is paid. (Tr. 50-51; AE 
B) He said he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($285). (Tr. 52) He believed the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.j ($1,944) was paid using a garnishment from his salary in 2008. (Tr. 53) His October 
7, 2014 credit report shows four medical debts were paid, including a medical judgment 
for $2,206 that was satisfied in 2008. (AE G) 
 
At one point Applicant’s student loans were delinquent and his pay was being 
garnished $180 monthly; however, after six months the garnishment was lifted, and the 
monthly payment was reduced to $90. (Tr. 57-59) He is current on his student loans and 
child support payments. (Tr. 61; AE C, H) 
 
Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2008 to 2012 in 2012 
and 2013. (Tr. 55-56; GE 3) He believed he did not have to file a tax return if he did not 
owe any taxes. (GE 2) He owed $28 for federal income taxes for tax year 2011, which 
he paid when he filed his tax return. (Tr. 55; GE 3) Most of those years, he was due to 
receive a refund. His federal and state taxes are current. (Tr. 56-57)    
 
Applicant’s October 7, 2014 credit report shows one negative account and one 
collection account as “potentially negative information.” (AE G) It shows 12 accounts as 
“pays as agreed.” (AE G) A utility account with a zero balance shows a $69 charge off, 
and it indicates the debt was paid in January 2014. (AE G) Although he did not indicate 
he had financial counseling, he generated a personal financial statement or budget. He 
promised to maintain his finances and ensure he does not have future delinquent debt.

Personal Conduct 
 
When Applicant completed his January 4, 2012 SF 86, he disclosed his 
delinquent student loans and child support debts. (Tr. 65; GE 1) He also disclosed that 
he had not timely filed his tax returns for 2008 to 2011. He explained that he had been 
living in a different state from when his delinquent debts occurred, and he was not 
aware of any delinquent debts, except for his student loans and child support debt. (Tr. 
65) On January 25, 2012, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant, and he learned that several debts were listed as delinquent on 
his credit report. (Tr. 66)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM interview, and SOR response. His SOR alleges 10 delinquent,

collection, or charged-off accounts totaling $18,233. He filed his federal and state 
income tax returns from 2008 to 2012 in 2012 and 2013. The Government established 
the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g), and additional inquiry 
about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
to 20(c). His financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond his 
control. Applicant has a lengthy history of unemployment. He had insufficient income to 
pay his debts; however, after he became employed, he brought his student loans and 
child support to current status, and paid numerous medical debts. He filed his state and 
federal income tax returns for 2008 to 2012 in early 2012 and 2013, and he had 
withheld sufficient funds so that he only owed $28. All of his taxes are current. He 
promised to maintain his financial responsibility.3  
 
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” He became unemployed and lacked the income to pay his debts. This 
is an unusual circumstance that caused his delinquent debt. He acted responsibly under 
the circumstances by maintaining contact with some of his creditors,4 making payments 
and bringing his student loans, taxes, and child support to current status, as well as 
paying his other delinquent debts. Although he did not receive financial counseling, 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith. AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the debts he successfully disputed, which were then 
removed from his credit report.     
 
                                            
3 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts because of unemployment. He has 
done all that is reasonably possible for him to do to establish his financial responsibility. 
His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
One personal conduct disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 16 is potentially 
applicable. AG ¶ 16(a) provide, “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to . . . determine 
security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . .”5 
 
SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b allege Applicant deliberately omitted several delinquent 
debts from his January 4, 2012 SF 86. However, AG ¶ 16(a) does not apply because 
his omission of financial information was not intentional. He disclosed adverse financial 
information about not timely filing his tax returns, his history of delinquent student loans 
and delinquent child support debts. Some of the negative information in his credit report 
was incorrect. Moreover, he moved to a different state, and he was unaware of some 
delinquent debt. Applicant did not intend to deceive security officials. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                            
5The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old information technology professional, who has worked 
for a defense contractor for the previous three years. In 2004, he was awarded a 
bachelor’s of science degree in computer networking. He served on active duty in the 
Marine Corps for one year and for five years in the reserves as a wireman; he left the 
Marine Corps as a corporal (E-4); and he received an honorable discharge. He is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He 
deserves some credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee 
of a contractor and in the Marine Corps. There is every indication that he is loyal to the 
United States and his employer. His unemployment caused his financial woes. I give 
Applicant some credit for maintaining contact with some of his creditors and bringing his 
student loans and child support debts to current status. As a result of his 
unemployment, he fell behind on his child support, student loans, and some other debts. 
He failed to file his income tax returns, as is required when one’s income exceeds 
certain levels. Even though he did not owe the Government, his failure to file tax returns 
was irresponsible and violated federal law. However, once he learned that he was 
required to file his tax returns notwithstanding that he did not owe taxes, he did so.       
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant’s October 7, 2014 credit report corroborates his 
statements about not having any delinquent debts. He understands what he needs to do 
to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he will keep 
his promise to maintain his financial responsibility.6    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
and personal conduct concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  For Applicant 
 
                                            
6Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative 
security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise 
made in a security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and 
may support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this Applicant’s security clearance is 
conditional.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
