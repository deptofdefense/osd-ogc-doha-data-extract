GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant accumulated approximately $35,000 in delinquent debt. He resolved 
two of his debts, totaling $660, but remains indebted on his delinquent mortgage. 
Resulting security concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings 
and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of Case 
 
 On November 1, 2013, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-
86). On May 5, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), effective within the 
DOD after September 1, 2006.

 Applicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2014, and requested that his case be 
decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 4.) 
Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case on September 4, 2014. A 
complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing nine Items, was 
provided to Applicant on said date, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt 
of the FORM.  
 
 Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM 
on September 10, 2014, and timely returned the receipt to the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). He did not provide additional information in response to 
the FORM within the 30-day period. DOHA assigned the case to me on November 3, 
2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 48 years old. He has worked for a Government contractor since June 
2010. He is married and has three adult children. (Item 6.)  
 
 The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $35,000 in delinquent debt. In 
his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a and denied the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. (Item 4.) His debts are found in the credit reports entered into 
evidence dated December 7, 2013 and August 27, 2014. (Item 8; Item 9.) After a 
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact. 
 
 As of the date of the SOR, Applicant was over 120 days past due on his home 
mortgage loan, in the approximate amount of $34,421. Applicant stopped paying on his 
mortgage over three years ago after he refinanced his residence. During the process of 
the refinancing, the mortgage company added in the cost of home owner’s insurance to 
his mortgage payment, creating a payment that was much higher than Applicant 
expected. Applicant contested the addition of the insurance and found a lower 
insurance quote, but the mortgage company would not allow him to switch. As a result, 
he stopped making payments on his mortgage. Applicant has been in recent contact 
with the mortgage company, but offered no proof of resolution. This debt is now past 
due in the amount of $44,052 and remains unresolved. (Answer; Item 7; Item 8.)  
 
 Applicant was indebted on a collections account in the approximate amount of 
$468, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.b. In his Answer, Applicant claimed that this debt belonged 
to his son, who has the same name as Applicant. His August 27, 2014 credit report 
reflects this debt was paid. (Item 7.) 
 
 Applicant was indebted to a communications company in the amount of $192, as 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt showing a payment of 
$192.61 was made to this creditor on May 27, 2014. This debt is resolved. (Answer.) 
 
 
3 
 
 
 
 Applicant resolved $660 of the $35,000 in SOR-listed debts. His August 27, 2014 
credit report reflects one new $15 delinquency. (GE 8.) He failed to submit evidence of 
financial counseling, a budget, or income statement. He submitted no evidence 
concerning the quality of his professional performance, the level of responsibility his 
duties entail, or his track record with respect to handling sensitive information and 
observation of security procedures. He provided no character references describing his 
judgment, trustworthiness, integrity, or reliability.  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶¶ 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable 
guidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. 
The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “[t]he applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” Section 7 
of Executive Order 10865 provides: “[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an 
applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” 
 
A person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
 
 
4 
 
 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Since 2011, Applicant accumulated over $35,000 in delinquent debt that he was 
unable or unwilling to satisfy until recently, when he resolved two debts totaling $660. 
The evidence raises both security concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to 
rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  
 
 The guideline includes five conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from Applicant’s financial difficulties: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
 
5 
 
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s delinquent debt began accumulating in 2011. He remains delinquent 
on his mortgage debt in an amount that has grown from $34,421 to $44,052. His most 
recent credit report reflects a new $15 delinquent debt. He did not demonstrate that 
future financial problems are unlikely to occur. His reliability and trustworthiness in 
managing delinquent debts remain a concern. The evidence does not support the 
application of AG ¶ 20(a).  
 
 Applicant failed to present evidence that his financial problems were due to 
circumstances beyond his control. He failed to provide evidence that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that he attempted to resolve the debts while 
they were accumulating, despite full-time employment. AG ¶ 20(b) has no application.  
 
 Applicant failed to provide evidence that he participated in financial counseling or 
that he had a plan to fully resolve his debts. However, he addressed two SOR-listed 
debts, identified in ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, which are now resolved. AG ¶ 20(c) has no 
application to ¶ 1.a, as there are not clear indications that his delinquent mortgage is 
under control. Applicant’s payment of ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c indicates a good-faith effort to 
resolve those debts. Hence, AG ¶ 20(d) has application to the SOR-listed debts in ¶¶ 
1.b and 1.c.  
 
 Applicant contended that he disputed the cost of the insurance that was added to 
his refinanced mortgage. He failed to provide documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of his dispute or provide evidence of any actions to resolve it. AG ¶ 20(e) has no 
application.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility 
for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines, and the whole-person concept.    
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 48-year-old 
employee of a defense contractor. He remains delinquent on his debt to his mortgage 
company in the amount of $44,052. Although Applicant paid off two small debts, he 
failed to establish a track record of responsibly managing his finances. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant’s present eligibility and suitability 
for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns 
arising under the guideline for financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
