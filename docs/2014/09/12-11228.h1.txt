LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 30, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on May 13, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2014. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 24, 
2014, scheduling the hearing for August 12, 2014. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without 
 
2 
 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which 
were admitted without objection. The record was held open until August 26, 2014, for 
Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted a document that was marked 
AE D and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
August 21, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 1983. He seeks to retain his security clearance. He has a 
master’s degree. He married for the second time in 1991. He has three adult children 
and two adult stepchildren.1 
 
 The SOR alleges a delinquent $30,937 credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a $461 
delinquent medical account (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant admitted owing the credit card debt, 
but he established that the medical debt was paid in May 2014.2 
 
 Applicant had extensive medical expenses for his stepdaughter and his daughter. 
His 26-year-old stepdaughter has an intellectual disability. She also has a temper, and 
she has been violent, which cost her several jobs. The emotional stress from the 
stepdaughter affected Applicant’s daughter, and his daughter had to be hospitalized. 
Applicant used credit cards for living expenses. The credit cards raised the interest 
rates. He was unable to pay the bills and several debts became delinquent.3 
 
 Applicant listed delinquent credit card accounts of $30,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and 
$18,000 on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he 
submitted in June 2010. He wrote that the interest rates on the cards “unexpectedly 
rose to 30% and simultaneously had family financial demands that prevented 
repayment on company’s terms. I sought financial counseling and am hiring an attorney. 
I will settle this debt in court as soon as a case is filed.”4  
 
 Applicant’s credit report from July 2010 listed delinquent debts of $30,937 (SOR 
¶ 1.a), $17,623, and $37,753. The $37,753 account is in his wife’s name. Applicant is 
only an authorized user of the account and not personally liable for the debt.5

finances and therefore his finances. Any information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for 
disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the 
application of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the “whole person.”

 Applicant borrowed $25,500 from his 401(k) retirement plan in April 2011. He 
used the proceeds to pay off some car loans. He indicated that he may have paid other 
debts as well.6 
 
 In May 2012, Applicant reported to his company’s security officer that the creditor 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a obtained a $31,000 judgment against him. The judgment is 
accumulating interest. He also informed the security officer that he had credit card 
accounts for $25,000 and $15,000 that he could not pay. The information was 
forwarded by his company’s security officer to the DOD.7 
 
 Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2012. He 
discussed his financial problems resulting from his children’s medical expenses. He 
stated that he planned to pay his delinquent debts, but he did not know when he would 
be able to do so.8 
 
 Applicant and his wife saved money to be used for their debts. He settled a 
delinquent $17,791 credit card debt for $2,000 in October 2013.9 
 
 Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in January 2014. He wrote about 
his finances: 
 
I plan to retire in approximately 6 years and will pay all remaining 
delinquent credit card debts and judgment using portions from my 401K 
(approx. $215K to-date). This is not an excuse, my wife has been paying 
all the bills for many years so I was not aware of all debt balances. I take 
full responsibility. She and I are managing a financial plan forward to pay 
the mortgage, medical, utilities, auto, insurance and other necessities 
required to sustain a living, then pay the delinquent bills and judgment 
when I retire. This is the best way I plan to manage my finances going 
forward so no more obligations become delinquent.  
 
 In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he offered an interim payment 
of $200 to the creditor holding the judgment “to begin payment until settlement 
agreement.” He indicated that the creditor offered a $20,000 settlement. 
 
 Applicant testified that he no longer plans to wait until he retires to pay the 
judgment. He stated that the $25,500 loan from his 401(k) will be paid in October 2015. 
He will then take out another loan to be used to settle the judgment. As of August 8, 
2014, he owed $7,463 on the loan. He contributes 8% of his annual salary of $112,869 
(about $9,029) to his 401(k). The balance of the 401(k) on August 8, 2014, was

$267,234. He also has a pension plan through his employer. His wife earns about 
$45,000 per year. She has a pension through her work and about $40,000 in her 401(k). 
Applicant investigated withdrawing funds from his 401(k) to settle the judgment, but he 
did not qualify for the hardship conditions that would enable him to do so.10  
 
 Applicant and his wife took cruises in 2011 and 2013. He stated that the cruises 
were good for him and his wife as breaks from the mental anguish that his stepdaughter 
causes the family. He testified that they saved for the cruises and that the 2013 cruise 
was not expensive, about $600 to $800 in total, because it was a short cruise with just 
him and his wife. Applicant’s testimony that just he and his wife took the cruise is 
contradicted by his response to DOHA interrogatories in which he wrote: “I took a 
pleasure related (3 days at sea) vacation cruise . . . with my wife, two sons, one 
daughter and one stepdaughter to [location] in August 2013.”11 
 
 Applicant has not received financial counseling, but he has a budget. His wife 
has about $40,000 in student loans that are currently deferred. The balance of the credit 
card debt in his wife’s name is about $55,000. He stated they plan to settle the debt. 
Applicant and his wife have four cars in their name: one each for Applicant, his wife, his 
youngest daughter, and his intellectually-disabled stepdaughter. Applicant’s wife bought 
his stepdaughter a car in late 2013 for $5,000. The stepdaughter was convicted of 
driving while intoxicated (DWI). Applicant’s wife bought the car after the stepdaughter’s 
driver’s license was reinstated. The car was necessary for the stepdaughter to drive to 
meet her probation officer and to complete her community service.12 
 
 Applicant submitted a performance evaluation that reflects that he is a valued 
employee. It states that he “holds himself to high professional standards and exhibits a 
strong sense of accountability and willingness to take on new and difficult tasks.”13  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According

13 AE D.

to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 
6 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable or unwilling to pay his financial obligations for a period. 
The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 The medical costs for Applicant’s daughter and stepdaughter were outside his 
control. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must also have acted 
responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
 Applicant paid the $461 medical account in May 2014. SOR ¶ 1.b is concluded 
for Applicant. He settled a delinquent $17,791 credit card debt for $2,000 in October 
2013. He receives credit in mitigation for that action.  
 
 Applicant has owed more than $30,000 to one creditor since at least 2010. He 
borrowed $25,500 from his 401(k) retirement plan in April 2011, but he did not use the 
proceeds to settle the debt. Instead, he paid off some car loans. The creditor obtained a 
$31,000 judgment against him in 2012. While not in his name, his wife has a delinquent 
credit card debt of about $55,000 and about $40,000 in deferred student loans. In 2013, 
they bought a car for Applicant’s stepdaughter who does not work and had a DWI. 
Applicant and his wife both have pension plans and 401(k) retirement plans. He 
contributes about $9,000 per year to his 401(k). He went on cruises in 2011 and 2013. 
The inconsistent statements about who went on the cruise in 2013 are troubling.  
 
 Applicant has not made paying the judgment a priority. He initially planned to 
pay the judgment after he retires. He now states that he will settle the judgment in late 
 
7 
 
2015 with a loan from his 401(k). The Appeal Board has held that “intentions to pay off 
debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other 
responsible approaches.” See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013) 
(quoting ISCR Case No. 08-08440 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009)).  
 
 There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his 
debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) 
are not applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. I find that financial considerations 
concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 I considered Applicant’s favorable character evidence and his stable work 
history. I also considered the circumstances surrounding his financial problems. 
However, Applicant has not convinced me that he has made a legitimate effort to 
address those problems.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
