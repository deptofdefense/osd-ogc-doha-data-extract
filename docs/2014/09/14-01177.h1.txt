DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 5, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance. On May 29, 2014, Applicant 
 
2 
 
 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On July 18, 2014, the case was assigned 
to me. On July 24, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2014. The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, 
while Applicant testified, called his wife as a witness, and offered Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) 1 through 11. All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. 
The prehearing letter sent to Applicant was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 and 
Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was marked as HE 2. The transcript (Tr.) of the 
hearing was received on August 19, 2014. 
 
Procedural Matter 
 
Applicant’s Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of one federal and 
two state income tax statutory provisions. Department Counsel had no objection to that 
request, and it was granted. Copies of the statutory provisions were marked as HE 3-5.1  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for his current employer since July 1998. He graduated from high school in 
1986. He served in the Air Force on active duty from 1987 to 1996 and in the Air Force 
Reserve from 1996 to 2008. He attained the grade of master sergeant (E-7) and 
received an honorable discharge. He has been married twice. He married his current 
wife in 2002. He has two children, ages 18 and 22. He has held a security clearance 
without incident since about 1987.2 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2008 through 2012 as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both allegations with explanations. His 
admissions are incorporated as findings as fact.3 
 
In his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) dated 
October 28, 2013, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file his income tax returns for tax 
years 2008 through 2012. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his wife was 
injured in an automobile accident in 2001 and has had ten back surgeries. She operated 
a business as a sole proprietor and was responsible for maintaining the financial 
records for her business. He stated that, although she stayed abreast of the day-to-day

accounting tasks for the business, she fell behind on the year-end accounting tasks due 
to her medical issues.4 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant also provided documentation showing that 
he and his wife filed their 2008 through 2012 federal and state income tax returns. As 
reflected in the following tables, they did not owe any back taxes for those years.5 
  
Federal Income Tax Returns

2008 5/23/14 $2,512 
2009 5/23/14 $548

2011 5/23/14 $1,477 
2012 5/23/14 $407 
 
At the hearing, Applicant and his wife testified that she prepared their income tax 
returns. She is a lawyer with a family law practice. Her client records, which contained 
important tax information, are confidential, and Applicant does not have access to those 
records. They also testified that she had many surgeries for a back injury resulting from 
the 2001 automobile accident. In 2008, she had one of those surgeries and was 
diagnosed with a debilitating back disorder. She suffers from chronic pain that at times 
is crippling. She attributed the reason for her not filing the income tax returns in a timely 
manner to her back disorder. During the period in question, she continued to work at 
least part time and indicated that she placed her obligations to her clients above her 
obligations to file the income tax returns in a timely manner. She blamed herself for the 
delay in filing the income tax returns.6

6 Tr. 34-38, 40-44, 49-63, 77-94. Applicant’s wife served on active duty in the Air Force from 1988 
to 1992, in the Air National Guard from 1992 to 1996, and in the Air Force Reserve from 1996 to 2008. 
She attained the grade of master sergeant and was medically retired in 2008 due to her back injury. See 
Tr. 74-77; AE 11. Applicant testified that he lost his 2008 IRS Form W-2 that was issued by the military, 
had difficulty in obtaining a replacement, and indicated that was the reason for the delay in filing his 2008 
tax returns. See Tr. 41-44, 48-49, 63-64.

Applicant noted that he and his wife timely filed their 2002 to 2007 income tax 
returns and received income tax refunds for each of those years. He claimed only one 
personal exemption on his IRS Form W-4 and claimed no exemptions for his state 
income taxes. Because he always received income tax refunds, he was not concerned 
that his failure to file his income tax returns for 2008 to 2012 would result in a tax 
deficiency for those years. Applicant’s and his wife’s failure to file those income tax 
returns in a timely manner resulted in no financial benefit to either of them and actually 
resulted in a financial loss because they ultimately filed beyond the deadlines for 
collecting some of the refunds.7 
 
Applicant and his wife filed their federal and state income tax returns for 2013. 
They requested a filing extension for last year and filed those income tax returns on 
August 11, 2014, before the extensions expired. They received income tax refunds from 
the Federal Government and the state for 2013.8 
 
Applicant testified in a forthcoming manner and was a credible witness. He 
testified that he will not fail to meet his income tax filing requirements in the future. He 
and his wife intend to hire an accountant to prepare their tax returns. If they are unable 
to file jointly for some reason, he intends to file as “married, filing separately” even 
though that filing status may increase his tax liability.9 
 
For his military service, Applicant received four Air Force Achievement Medals 
and three Air Force Commendation Medals. He has also received nine special 
recognition awards from his current employer. His employer’s award citations describe 
him as a dedicated professional.10 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no

8 Tr. 37-38, 55-56, 71-74; AE 9, 10.

one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 sets forth several conditions that raise potential security concerns. 
Applicant’s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing established one of 
those disqualifying conditions:   
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required . . . . 
 
 Three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.  
 
 Before 2013, Applicant’s, wife who is an attorney, prepared their income tax 
returns. She suffers from a chronic back disorder that hindered her ability to file their 
income tax returns. While her back disorder may be a reasonable excuse for some 
delays in filing of their 2008 to 2012 income tax returns, it did not justify the lengthy 
delays incurred in this case. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply.  
 
 In 2014, Applicant and his wife filed their 2008 to 2012 income tax returns. They 
received no financial benefit from delaying the filing of those returns. Applicant credibly 
 
7 
 
 
testified that he will file his income tax returns as required in the future. Applicant and 
his wife hired an accountant to file their 2013 income tax returns. Applicant also 
indicated, if a situation arose in the future in which he and his wife could not timely file 
joint income tax returns, he would then file the tax returns as “married, filing separately.” 
The alleged financial problems are resolved, are unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt 
on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 
20(c) apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under 
the Guideline F analysis, but some warrant additional comment. 
 Applicant honorably served in the military for 21 years. He has been a valued 
employee in his current civilian job for over 16 years. His financial situation is stable. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
    
   Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.b:  For Applicant

Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
