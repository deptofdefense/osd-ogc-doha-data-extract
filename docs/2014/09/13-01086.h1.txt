HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling 
$201,908. Eleven SOR debts were for student loans and totaled $199,108. The other 
four debts totaled $2,800. He brought his student loans to current status and made 
some payments to address his medical debts. He made sufficient progress resolving his 
financial problems to mitigate financial considerations concerns. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 24, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
November 5, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators were unable 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended that his case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On November 24, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR, and indicated he 
waived his right to a hearing. On December 21, 2013, Applicant requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On June 16, 2014, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on 
Applicant’s case. On June 19, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to another administrative judge, and on July 7, 2014, 
the case was transferred to me for administrative reasons. On August 18, 2014, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for August 27, 2014. (HE 1) Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits, and Applicant offered 
two exhibits. (Tr. 17, 23-26; GE 1-3; AE A-B) There were no objections, and I admitted 
GE 1-3 and AE A-B. (Tr. 18, 26) On September 8, 2014, DOHA received the transcript 
of the hearing. The record was held open until September 15, 2014. (Tr. 93) On 
September 15, 2014, Applicant provided an additional exhibit, which was admitted 
without objection. (AE C; HE 4)       
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations; 
however, he indicated the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o should be paid off. (HE 3) 
His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old engineer, who requires a security clearance for his 
employment by a defense contractor. (Tr. 8; GE 1) He graduated from high school in 
1997, and he was awarded a bachelor’s of science degree in 2005, and a master’s 
degree in business administration and project management in 2008. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) He 
never served in the military. (Tr. 7; GE 1) He has never married, and he does not have 
any children. (Tr. 8)    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his May 24, 2013 SF 86, 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), June 7, 2013 
credit report, SOR response, and hearing record.  
 
Applicant is living in his grandmother’s home, and he does not pay rent. (Tr. 27-
30) He purchased a vehicle in 2003, and he paid off the car loan. (Tr. 31) He has

$1,300 in the bank. (Tr. 34) He owes about $3,700 on a credit card, and he makes the 
minimum payments. (Tr. 37) His monthly expenses are about $550. (Tr. 40) 
 
Applicant was employed from May 2008 to June 2012, and he earned about 
$60,000 each year. (Tr. 43, 72) He earned about $30,000 in 2012. (Tr. 91-92) He was 
unemployed from June 2012 to September 2013. (Tr. 43) Applicant has not been 
employed since October 2013. (Tr. 32) He was employed for about six weeks in 
September to October 2013. (Tr. 33) In the last 12 months, he has earned about 
$6,500. (Tr. 34, 86) He does not have any earnings in 2014. (Tr. 91) He is not receiving 
unemployment compensation. (Tr. 91) 
 
Some of Applicant’s student loan debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j are duplications of 
each other. (Tr. 60, 74-76; AE A) He made sporadic payments on his student loans until 
he became unemployed. (Tr. 73, 85) He had his student loans consolidated, and now 
he owes about $185,000 in student loans as of July 26, 2014. (Tr. 76-77; AE A; AE C at 
16) He believed his father, a bus driver, who is cosigned on the loans, made some 
payments on his student loans; however, he did not provide proof that his father made 
any payments. (Tr. 77, 79) From December 2013 to July 30, 2014, he made the 
required nine $10 payments and brought his student loans to current status. (Tr. 60; AE 
A, AE C at 17) He made the $10 monthly payments using automatic withdrawals from 
his credit card account. (Tr. 61-62; AE C at 17-18) In August 2014, he agreed to an 
additional 10 months of $10 monthly payments to keep his student loans current. (Tr. 
87-88) When Applicant returns to employment, the Department of Education will 
reassess the amount of his required student loan monthly payment. (Tr. 63)   
 
 In May 2013, Applicant obtained his credit report, noticed the creditors on the 
report, and notified them that he was unemployed, and would begin making payments 
once he obtained employment. (Tr. 58-59) This notification included informing the 
apartment complex in SOR ¶ 1.l ($1,684) of his employment status.  
 
Applicant believed he or his grandmother paid the three medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.m ($534), 1.n (482), and 1.o ($100); however, he did not provide proof of those 
payments. (Tr. 45-56, 89; AE B; GE 2) He provided proof that he paid numerous 
medical debts; however, he was unable to connect the medical payments with the three 
medical debts cited in the SOR and his credit report. (Tr. 45-56; AE B) His credit report 
did not name the medical creditor; however, there was a toll free 800 telephone number 
which might have additional information about the medical debts. (Tr. 56-57; GE 2)  
 
Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. 78-79) He 
understands how to budget. (Tr. 79) He assured that he will bring his accounts to 
current status once he obtains employment. (Tr. 78-84)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his May 24, 2013 SF 86, OPM PSI, June 7, 2013 credit report, SOR 
response, and hearing record. His SOR alleges 11 SOR student loan debts, totaling 
$199,108, and 4 other SOR debts, totaling $2,800. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 
20(a), 20(b), and 20(c). His financial problems were affected by circumstances largely 
beyond his control. Applicant has a lengthy history of unemployment. He had insufficient 
income to pay his debts; however, he brought his student loans to current status, paid 
numerous medical debts, and paid off his car loan debt. He promised to pay his 
remaining debts once he becomes employed.3  
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence4 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
                                                                                                                                            
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
3 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
4Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay her creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before he has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.” He became unemployed and lacked the income to 
pay his debts. This is an unusual circumstance that caused his delinquent debt. He 
acted responsibly under the circumstances by maintaining contact with his creditors,5 
making payments and bringing his student loans to current status, and paying many of 
his medical debts. Although he did not receive financial counseling, there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not dispute any of his delinquent SOR 
debts.    
                                            
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts primarily because of unemployment. 
He has done all that is reasonably possible for him to do to establish his financial 
responsibility in light of his limited resources. His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old engineer, who requires a security clearance for his 
employment by a defense contractor. He was awarded a bachelor’s of science degree 
in 2005, and a master’s degree in business administration and project management in 
2008. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security 
responsibilities. He deserves some credit for volunteering to support the U.S. 
Government as an employee of a contractor. There is every indication that he is loyal to 
the United States and his employer. His lengthy period of unemployment caused his 
financial woes. I give Applicant substantial credit for maintaining contact with his 
creditors, consolidating his student loans, paying some of his creditors, and bringing his 
$185,000 in student loan debt to current status, even though he has been unemployed 
for all of 2014. He is paying what he is able to pay to his creditors.    
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial

problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. He efforts at debt resolution have established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he will keep his promise to pay his 
delinquent debts once he is employed.6    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.o:  For Applicant 
 
                                            
6Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative 
security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise 
made in a security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and 
may support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this Applicant’s security clearance is 
conditional.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
