Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling 
$18,538, and foreclosure of her residence in 2009. In 2003, her husband passed away; 
she had lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment; and she had serious 
medical problems. She paid one SOR debt, and two other SOR debts are in an 
established payment plan. She has established a track record of debt resolution. 
Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 13, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 5). On 
May 20, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and it recommended that her case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether her clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On June 15, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR and indicated she waived 
her right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated July 24, 2014, was provided to her on August 4, 2014.1 On August 25, 2014, 
Applicant responded to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 12, 
2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and she 
provided mitigating information. (Item 4) Her admissions are accepted as findings of 
fact.  
 
Applicant is 60 years old, and she has worked for a defense contractor since 
September 2013 in mail services.3 She graduated from high school in 1972. (Item 6) 
She married in 1972, and her husband passed away in 2003. Her children were born in 
1972, 1975, 1977, and 1979. She has never served in the military. She does not have 
any reportable criminal offenses, illegal drug use, or alcohol abuse. She disclosed her 
financial problems on her November 13, 2013 SF 86. 
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, 
January 16, 2014 Office of Personnel Management personnel subject interview (OPM 
PSI), SOR response, and FORM response. Her SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, 
totaling $18,538, and foreclosure of her residence in 2009, as follows: (1)-(2) ¶¶ 1.a 
($367) and 1.j ($96) are telecommunications collection debts; (3)-(6) ¶¶ 1.b ($1,237), 
1.c ($7,348), 1.i ($2,373), and 1.l ($4,861) are bank collection debts; and (7)-(13) ¶¶ 1.d 
($285), 1.e ($695), 1.f ($51), 1.g ($207), 1.h ($231), 1.k ($303), and 1.m ($384) are 
medical collection debts.   
 
 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 24, 2014, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 4, 2014. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she 
had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s November 13, 
2013 SF 86. (Item 5)

In 2000, Applicant’s spouse of 28 years became ill and was confined to a 
wheelchair.4 As a result of his illness, Applicant and her spouse incurred some medical 
expenses, and in 2003, he died. Before he died, Applicant and her husband had good 
credit. (SOR response) Applicant was unable to make the payments on her residence, 
and in 2009, her bank foreclosed. Under state law there is no deficiency owed to the 
bank. 
  
Applicant was unemployed from October 2003 to July 2005; from September 
2007 to May 2009; and from October 2011 to April 2012.5 (Item 6) She was unemployed 
or a part-time housekeeper from May 2012 to August 2013. (Item 6) She had low-
paying employment at a nonprofit entity from June 2009 to September 2011. Her 
current income is not part of the record. During her unemployment, she lived off of her 
credit cards and some of her husband’s life insurance, and she received funds from her 
family. She has not received financial counseling. 
 
Applicant suffered from medical problems after her spouse passed away in 2003. 
She had migraines and depression. In 2005, she had surgery after she broke her hip, 
and her seven SOR bills for medical treatment were not covered by health insurance. 
(Item 4)  
 
Applicant is paying $100 monthly to address the two medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.e ($695) and 1.g ($207). (SOR response) She paid the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.f 
($51). (FORM response) Applicant said she has been making payments for six months, 
and the creditor wrote that Applicant’s account for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g is in 
good standing. (FORM response) 
  
On August 11, 2014, Applicant consulted a bankruptcy attorney about resolution 
of her debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (FORM response) Her attorney 
wrote that Applicant should not file for bankruptcy because most of her debts appeared 
to be barred from collection under the state’s four year statute of limitations. (FORM 
response) Applicant elected not to file for bankruptcy. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
                                            
4Unless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s FORM 
response. 
  
5Unless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph is 
Applicant’s January 16, 2014 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI). 
(Item 6) 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
    
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, OPM PSI, SOR response, and FORM response. Several of Applicant’s 
debts became delinquent more than ten years ago after her husband died. Her SOR 
alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling $18,538, and foreclosure of her residence in 2009. 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
           
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
  AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(e) are not applicable. Applicant’s has multiple delinquent 
debts, and she did not provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of any 
disputed debts and evidence of actions to resolve the dispute. She did not provide 
evidence that she established and maintained contact with all of her creditors.6   
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
                                            
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence7 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
  Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 
20(a), 20(b), and 20(c). She paid about $600 to address her medical debts in the last six 
months. She paid one medical debt, and she brought two medical debts to current 
status. Although she did not receive financial counseling, there are clear indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
 
  Applicant’s illness, the death of her husband, underemployment, and 
unemployment are circumstances largely beyond her control. Before her husband’s 
death, she had good credit. She understands what she must do to establish and 
maintain her financial responsibility.8 The Appeal Board explained that circumstances 
beyond one’s control can cause unresolved debt, and are not necessarily a bar to 
having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). Circumstances beyond her 
control adversely affected her finances, and now that she is employed in the mailroom, 
she is addressing her delinquent debts, and her financial problems are unlikely to recur. 
Her delinquent SOR debts do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment. Her efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                            
7Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
8The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 60 years old, and she has worked for a defense contractor since 
September 2013 in mail services. She married in 1972; her husband passed away in 
2003; and her four children are adults. She does not have any reportable criminal 
offenses, illegal drug use, or alcohol abuse. She disclosed her financial problems on her 
November 13, 2013 SF 86. She is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her 
security responsibilities. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States 
the DoD, and her employer.   
 
Applicant had lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment. She had 
serious medical and financial problems after her husband died in 2003. These 
circumstances largely beyond her control are unlikely to recur now that she has 
employment in the mailroom. Her SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling $18,538 
and a foreclosure in 2009. Seven of those SOR debts are medical in origin. She paid 
one medical debt and two other medical debts are in established payment plans. The 
Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial 
cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a

time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and she understands what she needs to do to 
establish and maintain her financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust 
her. Moreover, she established a “meaningful track record” of debt repayment. I am 
confident she will maintain her financial responsibility.9   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.n:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.

9Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative 
security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise 
made in a security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and 
may support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.
