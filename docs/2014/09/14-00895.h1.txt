GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 8, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On April 24, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn statement, dated May 
29, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on July 1, 2014. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2014. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on July 25, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
August 14, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and four 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 25, 2014. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted seven additional documents which were marked as AE E 
through AE K and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
August 27, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.f.). He denied the one 
remaining allegation (¶ 1.e.). Applicant’s answers and explanations are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain the secret security clearance which was granted to him in 2001.2 He has been 
employed by the same defense contractor since August 2007, and currently serves as 
an electronic technician.3 Applicant was laid off in July 2007 and remained unemployed 
until August 2007.4 At the time of his lay-off, Applicant received severance pay.5  He has 
never served with the United States military.6  
 
A June 1979 high school graduate, Applicant has periodically attended college 
classes since October 2007, but has not earned a degree.7 He was married in May

two daughters, born in 1983 and 1984,9 as well as three step-daughters, born in 1986, 
1989, and 1991.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1997 when he 
and his first wife divorced. Maintaining his own residence and a separate residence for 
his ex-wife and two children, in addition to his child support obligations, as well as his 
various credit card balances, was more than his salary could sustain.11 With insufficient 
money to maintain his monthly payments, some accounts became delinquent.12 In July 
1999, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and 
in October 1999, about $20,000 of Applicant’s unsecured nonpriority claims were 
discharged (SOR ¶ 1.a.).13 As a result of the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant’s financial 
situation was dramatically improved. Financial good fortune continued, and in 
November 2002, Applicant had a 401(k) retirement account worth $34,000, a residence 
worth $440,000, and a monthly net remainder of $1,925 available for discretionary 
spending or savings.14 At that time, other than his mortgage, Applicant had no 
installment or credit card debts. 
Applicant’s next period of financial difficulty arose in July 2007 when he was laid 
off. As the economy started to deteriorate, he was unable to obtain a new job in the 
local area, and after he obtained his new job in August 2007, he was forced to relocate, 
first himself, and eventually the entire family, at his own expense, across the country to 
another state.15 In 2008, before the family relocated, Applicant’s wife lost her job.16 He 
was unable to sell his old residence. In an effort to work out some type of mortgage 
modification, Applicant was in constant contact with the mortgage holder, but it was 
“pretty much uninterested.”17 He took a loan from his 401(k) to save his residence.18 
One of the results of his efforts to save his residence from foreclosure was to place him

into a higher income tax bracket. Applicant’s accountant timely e-filed Applicant’s 2007 
income tax return with an installment agreement request and a $200 payment, but the 
filing was rejected. The payment was returned with a memo stating that he did not owe 
any taxes.19 He later submitted a hard copy of his return by mail.20 Although Applicant 
received letters from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) acknowledging his request for 
an installment agreement,21 he also received IRS letters denying his income tax return 
had been received.22 At one point, Applicant was told that he owed the IRS over 
$100,000.23 Because he was unable to resolve the issues with the IRS, Applicant 
engaged the services of a tax resolution service to assist him. Resolution was finally 
achieved in late 2013.24 The tentative balance owed the IRS was determined to be 
$40,000 (SOR ¶ 1.b.), but a significant portion of that amount can be abated.25 
Commencing in January 2014, Applicant started making monthly installment payments 
of $576 to the IRS.26 Applicant’s IRS delinquency is in the process of being resolved. 
The SOR identified four other delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection, charged off, or went to foreclosure, as generally reflected by a July 2013 
credit report and a March 2014 credit report.27 Those four debts listed in the SOR and 
their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted 
by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below. 
There was a first mortgage loan of $359,600 on the residence for which Applicant 
had attempted to seek a home loan modification that was foreclosed upon in 2008 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.).28 The mortgage holder took title of the residence in November 2008 and 
sold it at a foreclosure sale.29 Notwithstanding the zero balance and past-due balance 
reflected in Applicant’s July 2013 credit report, the SOR alleges that the approximate 
amount of $359,600 is still owed and remains unpaid. Applicant was issued a Form 
1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property, reflecting a principal balance

of $347,460.47, and a fair market value of the property of $365,244.67.30 Block 5 of the 
Form 1099-A reflects that the borrower is not personally liable for repayment of the 
debt.31 (emphasis added) Applicant believed he had also received a Form 1099-C, 
Cancellation of Debt, reflecting a debt of nearly $200,000. Both forms are not generally 
issued for the same debt, and it appears that he was mistaken. Nevertheless, he 
contended he paid the taxes on that cancelled debt in 2008.32 Applicant was unable to 
submit the Form 1099-C, and there is no allegation that he failed to pay his tax on the 
cancelled debt.  
Applicant is not liable for the deficiency, if there was one, for under California law, 
there is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency Statute,33 which states in relevant part:  
 
No deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property 
or an estate for years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or 
her contract of sale, or under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the 
vendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price of that real 
property or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or mortgage 
on a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure 
repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the 
purchase price of that dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the 
purchaser.  
Under this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a 
deficiency, the lender has no recourse regarding “purchase money loans,” also called 
“non-recourse loans,” the amount set forth in the mortgage used to finance the 
purchase of the dwelling. The collateral or dwelling is considered full satisfaction. 
However, there is a caveat, for the protection is afforded only if the borrower actually 
dwells in the property, a fact which has been met in this instance. There is another 
pertinent law, called the One Form of Action Rule,34 which states in relevant part: “There 
can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt, or the performance of any 
right secured by mortgage upon real property.” Accordingly, the comment in the July 
2013 credit report credit that there is a zero balance, as well as the comment in the 
Form 1099-A that the borrower is not personally liable for repayment of the debt are 
accurate reflections of the facts, and there is no deficiency. The account has been 
resolved.

There was a second mortgage or home equity loan of $182,432 on the same 
residence that was charged off in September 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.d.).35 During the hearing, 
Applicant was under the impression that the lender had issued him “a Form 1099,”36 but 
upon subsequent reflection, he determined he was in error, and the document was 
actually the Form 1099-A he had received from the mortgage lender on his first 
mortgage.37 Since the second mortgage is subordinate to the first mortgage, the 
interests of the second mortgage holder normally become a lien on the property. When 
the property was acquired by the first mortgage holder and sold, the second mortgage 
holder might receive repayments when the first mortgage is paid off. Applicant’s July 
2014 credit report reflects a zero balance on the charged-off account.38 There is 
insufficient evidence to determine if the second mortgage was actually paid off when the 
residence was sold by the first mortgage holder or if there is still a remaining unpaid 
balance. Under these circumstances, I conclude the account has not been resolved. 
There was a lawn service account with a balance of $530 that was placed for 
collection in September 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.e.).39 Applicant contends he verbally cancelled 
the monthly service “multiple times.” While the company stopped the service, it 
continued taking monthly deductions from his checking account.40 In an effort to thwart 
those monthly deductions, Applicant closed his checking account.41 In July 2013, 
Applicant indicated he would dispute the account or set up a repayment plan.42 In July 
2014, Applicant filed a formal dispute with Experian.43 Following Experian’s processing 
of the dispute, the negative credit item was not changed.44 Applicant does not believe 
he should be responsible for the charges, and he has not recently indicated how he 
planned to resolve the matter, of if he still intends to do so. The account has not been 
resolved.  
There was an unspecified type of account with a city with a balance of $493 that 
was placed for collection in February 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.f.).45 Because he had never 
received a bill, Applicant contacted the creditor to obtain information regarding the

charges but the creditor was unable to furnish any information.46 In July 2013, Applicant 
indicated he would dispute the account or set up a repayment plan.47 In July 2014, 
Applicant filed a formal dispute with both TransUnion and Experian.48 Following 
Experian’s processing of the dispute, the negative credit item was deleted.49 The result 
of the TransUnion dispute is unclear. The account has been resolved.  
Applicant recently furnished a personal financial statement. A review of that 
document reveals a total monthly family net income of $6,200. With routine monthly 
living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and transportation, as well as his IRS debt 
payments, of $3,262, he has approximately $2,938 available for discretionary spending 
or savings.50 Applicant’s assets have also appreciated to the point where he now has a 
401(k) worth $170,000, and bank savings of $5,000.51 All of Applicant’s newer accounts 
are current.52 It appears that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”53 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”54   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”55 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.56  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”57 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”58 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although he encountered some financial difficulties as early as 1997, 
Applicant’s most recent significant financial problems arose in 2007, and continued for 
several years thereafter. He was unable to continue making his routine monthly 
payments, and various accounts became delinquent and were either placed for 
collection, charged off, or foreclosed upon. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.59 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where the individual has a reasonable basis 
                                                          
59
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
 
10 
                                      
 
to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence 
of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(e) partially apply. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
initially since 1997, but reappearing in 2007, make it difficult to conclude that it occurred 
“so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by 
frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, 
his financial problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. The initial period of 
financial difficulty arose when he and his first wife separated, maintained separate 
households, and then divorced. Maintaining two residences, in addition to his child 
support obligations, as well as his various credit card balances, was more than his 
salary could sustain. With insufficient money to maintain his monthly payments, some 
accounts became delinquent. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy resolved those financial 
problems, and from October 1999 until at least July 2007, his financial situation 
remained excellent.  
Things deteriorated when Applicant was laid off in July 2007, and while he was 
able to obtain another job in August 2007, he was forced to relocate his family, at his 
own expense, across the country to another state. In 2008, before the family relocated, 
Applicant’s wife lost her job. With the collapsing economy and a disinterested mortgage 
lender, Applicant was unable to sell the house or get a mortgage modification for it. He 
initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his problems when he took a loan from his 401(k) 
to save his residence, but one of the unintended results of his efforts to save his 
residence from foreclosure was to place him into a higher income tax bracket. After 
lengthy and unusual delays in dealing with the IRS, commencing in January 2014, 
Applicant started making monthly installment payments of $576 to the IRS. 
Applicant’s residence was foreclosed upon in 2008, and the mortgage holder 
took title of the residence and sold it at a foreclosure sale. Applicant was issued a Form 
1099-A, reflecting a principal balance of $347,460.47, and a fair market value of the 
property of $365,244.67. As noted above, block 5 of the Form 1099-A reflects that the 
borrower is not personally liable for repayment of the debt. There was also a second 
mortgage or home equity loan of $182,432 on the same residence that was charged off 
in 2008. Since the second mortgage is subordinate to the first mortgage, the interests of 
the second mortgage holder normally become a lien on the property. There is 
insufficient evidence to determine if the second mortgage was actually paid off when the 
residence was sold by the first mortgage holder or if there is still a remaining unpaid 
balance.  
                                                                                                                                                                                           
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

Applicant disputed the two remaining SOR-related delinquent debts because he 
was unaware of one and felt he should not have been responsible for the other. One 
dispute, pertaining to an account for which even the creditor could not furnish 
information, was successful and the negative listing was deleted from his credit report. 
The other dispute was denied, and it is unclear what Applicant’s current intentions 
regarding the debt might be. 
While Applicant did not receive traditional financial counseling, he did engage the 
professional services of a tax resolution service to assist him with respect to his IRS 
issue. A review of his current finances reveals a total monthly family net income of 
$6,200, general household and debt expenses of $3,262, and approximately $2,938 
available for discretionary spending or savings. Applicant’s 401(k) is now worth 
$170,000, and he has bank savings of $5,000. All of Applicant’s newer accounts are 
current. Applicant acted responsibly by addressing all of his delinquent accounts, and 
attempting to work with his creditors.60 With his current job, there are clear indications 
that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.61 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
                                                          
60
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.62       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances on two separate occasions permitted a number of accounts to become 
delinquent, placed for collection, charged off, or to be foreclosed upon. In 1999 he had 
about $20,000 of unsecured nonpriority claims discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. In 2007, he again permitted various accounts to become delinquent, 
placed for collection, charged off, or to be foreclosed upon. One account for $530, a 
lawn service account, has been unresolved since 2010. The current status of the 
charged-off second mortgage remains unclear.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. The financial difficulties of the 1997-1999 time period were due 
primarily to his separation and eventual divorce, maintaining separate households, child 
support obligations, and his various credit card balances. The expenses were simply 
more than his salary could sustain. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy resolved those financial 
problems, and from October 1999 until at least July 2007, his financial situation 
remained excellent.  
Applicant’s most recent period of financial deterioration occurred when he was 
laid off in July 2007. A month later he obtained another job, but he was forced to 
relocate his family, at his own expense, across the country. In 2008, Applicant’s wife 
lost her job. Applicant was unable to sell his house or get a mortgage modification for it, 
so he took a loan from his 401(k) to save his residence. That effort to save his 
residence from foreclosure not only placed him into a higher income tax bracket, but it 
failed to save the house from foreclosure. Applicant was issued a Form 1099-A, 
reflecting a principal balance of $347,460.47, a fair market value of the property of 
$365,244.67, and an entry that the borrower is not personally liable for repayment of the 
debt. In January 2014, Applicant started making monthly installment payments of $576 
to the IRS. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:63 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.64 Overall, the evidence 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
   
                                                          
64
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 
2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
