GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 12, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On March 3, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 28, 2014. In a sworn 
statement, dated May 12, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On July 1, 2014, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on July 10, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 25, 2014. I convened the 
hearing as scheduled on August 11, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and four 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2014. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted five additional documents which were marked as exhibits 
AE E through AE I and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
August 25, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.j.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old self-employed owner of a small technology company 
as well as prospective employee of a defense contractor.2 He was previously an 
assistant professor at a university and a high school mathematics teacher. He has 
never served with the United States military.3 He has never held a security clearance.4 
 
A June 1979 high school graduate, Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in June 
1983, a master’s degree in June 1985, and a doctorate in June 1989.5 Applicant was 
married in August 1990 and has six children, born between 1994 and 2004.6

 While Applicant has been employed by his new employer, he has not yet earned any salary, and is 
awaiting a security clearance before becoming eligible for a salary. See GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated 
October 3, 2013), at 1.

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 1999. A series of 
events occurred commencing in 1995 that contributed to the accumulation of debt, 
which became a problem by 1999.7 From 1988 until 1995, Applicant had been an 
assistant professor in the mechanical engineering department at a university. Because 
of his perception that he would be denied tenure because of unspecified discrimination 
at the university, he searched for another university position. He eventually received an 
offer from another university, but declined the offer, deciding instead to start his own 
niche business.8 The business prospered with several customers, and generally 
generated between $60,000 and $80,000 per year.9 In 2013, that income had 
decreased to $47,817.10 
 
It was Applicant’s opinion that his annual income was insufficient to support his 
family.11 Furthermore, when the national economy collapsed, Applicant’s anticipated 
business growth evaporated. While he filed his income tax returns, self-employment 
taxes and income taxes were prioritized after household expenses, and were essentially 
unpaid.12 In May 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that he owed 
$261,880.10 for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for the tax years 2002 through 
2011.13 In an effort to generate additional income, in 2012, Applicant took a full-time 
position with a local high school as a mathematics teacher with an annual salary of 
$40,000.14 Applicant’s school salary during the 2013 school year was $19,514.78.15 
That amount, when added to his company income, enabled him to pay his 2013 taxes.16 
The following year, he was offered a position with a government contractor for 
$160,000. The school system was experiencing budgetary issues, and, at about the 
time he resigned his position, all new faculty members were laid off.17 The government 
contractor position is the one that requires a security clearance, and until he obtains 
one, Applicant cannot be paid.

As a result of his limited company income, the loss of his teaching position and 
income, the uncertainty of his new government contractor job, and the absence of a 
security clearance, over the years, as noted above, taxes remained unpaid, and he was 
unable to continue making all of his monthly payments. In addition, after he resigned 
from the high school system, he lost his health insurance. That situation remained until 
February 2014, when he enrolled for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.18 
Several tax liens were filed19 and some of his accounts became delinquent and were 
placed for collection. Applicant apparently contacted the IRS in July 2012, and 
established an installment agreement requiring monthly payments of $414, but he was 
unable to make any payments.20 He did another installment agreement in May 2013, 
and that agreement also failed through non-payments. In February 2014, an additional 
tax lien was filed in the amount of $14,283.21, covering the tax year 2012.21 In May 
2014, the IRS determined that Applicant does not have the ability to pay the money he 
owes the IRS and temporarily closed his collection case for the tax periods 2003 
through 2012.22 Applicant was advised that the case may be reopened in the future 
when his financial situation improves.23 Until such time, penalties and interest will 
continue to accrue.24 
While Applicant has had financial problems, including tax liens and delinquent 
accounts since 1999, during those 15 years before the hearing in August 2014 he had 
not sought any financial counseling.25 He finally took some online credit counseling on 
managing money.26 It is unclear if he ever obtained financial counseling on developing a 
debt management plan.  
Applicant’s company income during the months of June through August 24, 2014 
was $14,799.92.27 He estimated his monthly family expenses to be $5,447.28 Those 
figures indicate that there are little, if any, funds left over each month for discretionary 
spending or savings.

The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies, including five 
federal tax liens, four medical accounts, and one telephone account. Some accounts 
listed in the credit report have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or 
collection agents. None of the accounts listed in the SOR reflect an account number. 
Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the 
credit report and other evidence in the case file, including Applicant’s submissions 
regarding the same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a.-1.e.): There are five federal tax liens in varying amounts totaling 
approximately $201,486 that were filed in 2005 ($49,478), 2010 ($20,021), 2011 
($11,654), 2012 ($106,093), and 2013 ($14,240).29 As noted above, they were for 
unpaid self-employment taxes and income taxes. The IRS temporarily closed his 
collection case for the tax periods 2003 through 2012 when it determined that Applicant 
did not have the ability to pay the money he owes the IRS. Applicant established 
installment agreements on several occasions over the years, but he was unable to 
make any payments. He contends he made payments at irregular intervals totaling 
about $7,000,30 but did not submit any documentation to support his contentions or to 
indicate if the payments were made for his 2013 taxes or for his overall tax delinquency. 
The IRS collection action against him may be reopened in the future when his financial 
situation improves, and until such time, penalties and interest will continue to accrue. In 
addition, Applicant’s financial condition continues to deteriorate, and in February 2014, 
an additional tax lien (not listed in the SOR) was filed covering the tax year 2012. The 
accounts have not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.f., 1.g., 1.i., and 1.j.): There are four delinquent medical accounts with 
varying past-due balances totaling approximately $2,458 that were placed for collection 
in 2009 ($1,047, $51, and $27), and 2012 ($1,333).31 Two of the accounts ($1,047, and 
$51) were apparently transferred or sold to other debt collection agents in 2013. All of 
the accounts were for medical services Applicant’s children received in hospital 
emergency rooms during periods when Applicant did not have medical coverage.32 He 
approached two of the creditors but he was unable to settle with one of them (SOR ¶ 
1.f. for $1,333) because he had insufficient funds to make any payments to them.33 In 
May 2014, Applicant “settled” a delinquent account with a $27 balance (SOR ¶ 1.j.).34 
He indicated he searched the internet and was unable to locate the creditor on his two 
remaining medical accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.i.),35 but it should be noted that the

been resolved, and the remaining three medical accounts have not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): There is one delinquent telephone account with an unpaid balance 
of $414 that was placed for collection in 2013.37 In an effort to settle the account, 
Applicant contacted the creditor, and made two payments of $217 in June 2014.38 The 
account has been resolved. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”39 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”40   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”41 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.42  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”43 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”44 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 1999, Applicant found himself with insufficient funds 
to continue making his routine monthly payments, or his self-employment tax payments, 
various accounts became delinquent, and they were placed for collection, or federal tax 
liens were filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.45  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) only minimally applies. Applicant’s financial problems commenced 
when a series of events occurred that Applicant contends negatively impacted his 
finances. In 1995, he stepped down from an assistant professorship at a university 
when he perceived he would be denied tenure because of unspecified discrimination at 
                                                          
45
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

the university. Although he was offered another position at a different university, he 
chose, instead, to start his own business. While the business generated between 
$60,000 and $80,000 per year, in 2013, the income had decreased to $47,817. It was 
not until 2012 that he obtained a position teaching high school mathematics for $40,000 
per school year. After one year, he again resigned, hoping for a better-paying position 
elsewhere.  
 
Applicant contends his financial problems were largely beyond his control. 
However, his loss of employment with the university and the high school were not 
generated by those institutions, but rather by Applicant’s freedom of choice and his 
perceived perceptions. When he left the university, he could have accepted another 
university position, but he chose not to. Instead, he opted to start his own business. The 
business downturn in 2013 did not cause his financial problems with the IRS, as those 
financial difficulties had already existed for several years. The initial tax lien was filed in 
2005 because of his failure to pay self-employment and income taxes. While Applicant 
had four delinquent medical accounts totaling approximately $2,458, unexpected 
medical emergencies did not cause his financial problems, they were merely the result 
of his continuing financial problems.  
 
Applicant generally ignored his increasing federal tax debt until 2012, when the 
first of two failed installment agreements were established. Both installment agreements 
collapsed when Applicant could not make his monthly payments to the IRS. Likewise, 
he generally ignored his delinquent medical accounts from 2009 and 2012 until he paid 
one off (for $27) in May 2014. His delinquent telephone account was ignored until June 
2014. While the IRS has temporarily closed his collection case for the tax periods 2003 
through 2012, Applicant’s overall financial issues have been left unresolved. Applicant 
has failed to act responsibly under the circumstances.46  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s financial difficulties since 1999, or even before that time, make it difficult to 
conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” especially since those 
financial problems are continuing.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because while Applicant took some online credit 
counseling on managing money in August 2014, there is no evidence that he has ever 
received financial counseling or debt consolidation guidance. In addition, he failed to 
establish that there are clear indications that his finances are under control and his SOR 
debts are being paid. To the contrary, it is apparent that given his current financial 
situation, Applicant’s finances are far from being under control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) minimally applies because Applicant failed to initiate a “good-faith 
effort,” to start repaying any of five federal tax liens or three of his four delinquent

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when

medical accounts. There is evidence that he did resolve two SOR accounts for $27 and 
$414. Applicant made repayment arrangements with the IRS, but never made any 
payments. His delinquent medical account for $27 remained unresolved until 2014, and 
another delinquent medical account for $51 remains unresolved. Applicant’s excuse that 
he was unable to locate the collection agent for two of the delinquent medical accounts 
cannot withstand scrutiny when the address of the collection agent appears on the 
credit report. Over the years since 1999, Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or 
responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, he ignored all but two of his debts 
and generally continues to do so, claiming he is hoping to obtain a security clearance in 
order to commence work with the government contractor that was willing to offer him a 
position for $160,000. More positive movements should have already taken place to 
resolve some of his delinquent accounts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He is an 
educated individual who has held significant positions as a university assistant professor 
and high school mathematics teacher. He is a good parent. He has repeatedly declared 
his intention of resolving his delinquent accounts once he has the funds to do so.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. When he left the university, he could have accepted 
another university position, but he chose not to. Instead, he opted to start his own 
business. As noted above, his business downturn in 2013 did not cause his financial 
problems with the IRS, as those financial difficulties had already existed for several 
years. The initial tax lien was filed in 2005 because of his failure to pay self-employment 
and income taxes. Applicant generally ignored his increasing federal tax debt until 2012. 
He agreed to two installment agreements, but both installment agreements collapsed 
when Applicant could not make his monthly payments to the IRS. Likewise, he generally 
 
11 
                                      
 
ignored his delinquent medical accounts from 2009 and 2012 until he paid one off (for 
$27) in May 2014. His delinquent telephone account was ignored until June 2014.  
 
I am mindful that one or more factors such as his years of relatively low income 
and large family to support, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history 
in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the 
totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.47 
The absence of any efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to his SOR creditors 
are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 
2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:48 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a poor track record of making minimal efforts to pay 
his creditors (especially his taxes), and generally ignoring them until he is financially 
able to address his delinquent debts.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
