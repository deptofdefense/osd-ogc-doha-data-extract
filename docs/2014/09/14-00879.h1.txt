MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant began to struggle financially after he and his ex-wife separated in 
September 2010, and he was ordered to pay child support for their three children in March 
2011. His home was taken in foreclosure around March 2012 in settlement of his mortgage 
default, but Applicant owed delinquent debt of $8,325 as of April 2014. Those debts have 
been paid, and his financial situation is now stable. Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On April 25, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
 
 2 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on May 22, 2014, and he requested a 
decision on the written record without a hearing. The Government requested a hearing 
before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge, and on 
June 27, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. On August 1, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for August 19, 2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and 
one Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on August 29, 2014. At Applicant’s 
request and with no objection from the Government, the record was held open for two 
weeks for post-hearing exhibits. On September 2, 2014, at Applicant’s request and without 
objection from the Government, I extended the deadline to September 9, 2014, for post-
hearing submissions. 
 
On September 9, 2014, Applicant timely submitted six exhibits (AEs B–G). On 
September 10, 2014, I re-opened the record to consider the admission of an additional 
exhibit (AE H) forwarded by Applicant, which was not available to him by the deadline. 
Department Counsel filed no objections to AEs B–H by the September 19, 2014 deadline 
for comment. The documents were accepted into evidence, and the record closed on 
September 19, 2014. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of April 25, 2014, Applicant owed 
$10,349 in delinquent credit card debt (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h); $51 in medical debt 
in collection (SOR 1.c); and $486 for satellite television services in collection (SOR 1.d). In 
addition, Applicant’s mortgage loan went to foreclosure on a balance of $135,539 with 
$17,482 past due (SOR 1.g). In his Answer to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the 
debts, which he attributed to his divorce and child support obligation of $269 per week. 
Applicant expressed his intent to use funds from his 401(k) to satisfy the delinquent 
balances by May 30, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant’s admissions to the delinquencies are accepted and incorporated as 
findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the 
following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 30-year-old high school graduate, who has worked for a defense 
contractor since August 2003. He graduated from the company’s apprenticeship program 
as a pipefitter in 2007 and was recognized by the state for excellence in the classroom 
(highest overall grade point average among all trades). (Tr. 56-58.) In February 2014, 
Applicant was promoted to the salaried position of operations supervisor with an increase 
in his annual income from $56,000 to $81,000. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24.) He is responsible for 
 
 3 
approximately 15 pipefitters. (Tr. 59.) Applicant seeks to retain the secret-level security 
clearance, which he has held since November 2003. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant and his ex-wife were married from September 2008 to June 2011. They 
had two children together (born in 2004 and 2007) before they married. Their third child 
was born in 2009. In June 2007, Applicant bought a home for himself and his family with a 
$139,806 mortgage. Around September 2010, Applicant and his ex-wife separated. 
Applicant continued to provide financial support for his ex-wife and children after they 
moved out of the house. (Tr. 27-28.) Around March 2011, his ex-wife filed for divorce, and 
Applicant began paying child support at $269 per week. (GE 3; Tr. 21, 24-26.) He could no 
longer afford his mortgage, and he stopped making his monthly loan payments of $1,061. 
(AE B; Tr. 26-28.) In September 2011, Applicant returned from three months of temporary 
duty (TDY) out of state to discover that his lender was initiating foreclosure of his home. 
His mortgage was $17,482 past due on a $135,539 balance (SOR 1.g). Two weeks later, 
Applicant left the area for 11 months of additional TDY for his employer. (Tr. 29.) In 
February 2012, Applicant’s mortgage lender reclaimed the house in foreclosure to settle his 
mortgage default. (GEs 1-3; AEs B, H.) Applicant did not contact the mortgage company 
during the foreclosure process, so he was unaware if he owed a deficiency balance on his 
loan. (Tr. 29-30.) When Applicant vacated his home, he owed a satellite television 
company for rented equipment. The company placed a $486 balance for collection in 
August 2013. (GE 2.)  
 
Applicant’s financial problems went beyond his mortgage. In March 2011, Applicant 
notified his then auto loan lender that he could no longer afford his $231 monthly payments 
on his $13,607 loan balance. In September 2011, his vehicle was involuntarily repossessed 
and then sold to settle his loan. Applicant indicates that he was refunded $1,200 after the 
sale. A $1,800 credit card debt was placed for collection in May 2011 (SOR 1.e, duplicated 
in SOR 1.b). As of March 2012, the unpaid balance was $2,561.
1
 By the time the debt was 
placed with the assignee in SOR 1.b, the balance had increased to $2,816. Additionally, 
Applicant made no payments on the credit card accounts in SOR 1.a and 1.h after July 
2011, and respective balances of $3,534 and $1,057 were charged off and placed for 
collection. Around August 2011, Applicant stopped paying on the $381 retail charge 
balance identified in SOR 1.f. In February 2012, the debt was charged off to profit and loss. 
Applicant had used the credit card accounts in SOR 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h for household 
goods, heating oil, or gasoline. (GEs 1-3.) 
 
When Applicant returned from TDY around August 2012, he rented a room from a 
friend. In June 2013, he was again sent out of state by his employer. On his return from 
that assignment in September 2013, Applicant moved in with his ex-wife and children in an 
attempt to reconcile. (GE 3; Tr. 34.) 
 
                                                 
1 
Applicant expressed his belief that the $3,534 debt in SOR 1.a was the same debt as SOR 1.b. (Tr. 36.) 
However, available credit reports (GE 2; AE B) indicate that the account  (169601-xxxxxxxxxx) identified in 
SOR 1.e, which was opened with an electronics retailer in November 2008, was placed for collection with the 
assignee in SOR 1.b in February 2013. SOR 1.a was a separate MasterCard account opened in December 
2006. (GE 2; AE B.) 
 
 4 
On October 30, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to update his security 
clearance eligibility. He responded affirmatively to any delinquency involving routine 
accounts in the last seven years. He listed his mortgage foreclosure; his vehicle 
repossession; and approximate credit card balances of $1,700 (SOR 1.a), $3,000 (SOR 
1.e, duplicated in SOR 1.b), $200 (SOR 1.f), and $700 (SOR 1.h) that were unpaid. 
Applicant indicated that he was “currently making payment arrangements” on the credit 
card balances. (GE 1.) 
 
As of December 3, 2013, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his 
delinquent credit card debts. He owed $3,534 on SOR 1.a, $486 on SOR 1.d, $2,816 on 
SOR 1.e (duplicated in SOR 1.b), $381 on SOR 1.f, $1,057 on SOR 1.h, and $51 on a 
previously undisclosed medical debt in collection (SOR 1.c). The credit bureaus were 
discrepantly reporting an outstanding balance of $135,529 on his defaulted mortgage, but 
also that the account had been “closed foreclosure redeemed.” Applicant was making 
timely payments of $206 per month on a $6,294 automobile loan taken out in January 
2013, which had a $5,111 balance. (GE 2; AE B.) 
 
On December 18, 2013, Applicant was interviewed about his delinquent debts by an 
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated 
that his mortgage debt had been resolved through the foreclosure and sale of his home. 
(GE 3.) As of August 2014, the mortgage lender was reporting that the property had been 
conveyed to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in March 2012, so 
the principal balance on the loan was zero. (AE H.) During his interview with the OPM 
investigator, Applicant did not contest the balances shown on his credit report. He 
explained that he had failed to consider interest and late fees when he listed the debts on 
his e-QIP. Applicant added that he had contacted the credit lender identified in SOR 1.h in 
December 2013 to arrange for monthly payments on the debt. He was awaiting a response 
from the creditor. He had not yet responded to correspondence received in November 
2013 from the creditor collecting the debt in SOR 1.a. Applicant admitted that he had not 
contacted the creditors identified in SOR 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He did not recognize the medical 
debt in collection (SOR 1.c), but he expressed an intent to pay the debt if it was legitimate. 
Applicant explained that the debts became delinquent because of his marital separation 
and divorce, the loss of his ex-wife’s income, and him having to pay child support. 
Applicant added that he was considering taking a loan against his retirement account to 
pay his debts. (GE 3.) 
 
Applicant was again on TDY in another state from mid-April 2014 to mid-August 
2014. (Tr. 40, 51.) For being off-site, he was paid 15% above his base pay for 80 hours. 
(Tr. 51.) He borrowed $30,000 from his 401(k), which was deposited into his checking 
account in July 2014. Applicant had two outstanding loans, and the delay in obtaining the 
$30,000 loan was because he had to pay off one of them before he could obtain a new 
loan. (AE A; Tr. 44, 48.) Applicant borrowed enough to cover all of the debts in the SOR. 
He was not sure whether he had a deficiency balance on his mortgage loan. (Tr. 44.) On 
July 11, 2014, he paid $3,534.02 by check to satisfy the debt in SOR 1.a. (AEs A, C.) On 
July 14, 2014, he paid $2,738.06 by check to satisfy the debt in SOR 1.e (duplicated in 
 
 5 
SOR 1.b), $381 to satisfy the debt in SOR 1.f, and $486.38 by credit card to resolve his 
past-due satellite television debt in 1.d. (AEs A, B, E, G; Tr. 38, 43.) On July 15, 2014, 
Applicant paid $1,057.44 by pre-authorized debit to satisfy the debt in SOR 1.h. (AEs A, D; 
Tr. 43-44.) On August 18, 2014, Applicant paid $51.50 by credit card to satisfy the medical 
debt in SOR 1.c. He contacted the collection agency around April or May 2014 and was 
informed that the debt had been transferred back to the medical provider. (AE F; Tr. 37, 
39-40.) On September 10, 2014, he received confirmation that he owed nothing on the 
mortgage after the foreclosure. (AE H.) 
 
As of August 2014, Applicant has made timely payments on his January 2013 car 
loan, which has a balance of $3,560. (AE B; Tr. 21.) Applicant is also paying his $269 
weekly child support obligation on time through automatic withdrawals from his paycheck. 
(Tr. 21.) On his return in mid-August 2014 from yet another lengthy temporary duty 
assignment for his employer, Applicant and his ex-wife decided against reconciliation. 
Applicant is currently staying with a friend, although he intends to rent a separate 
residence. Applicant and his ex-wife have joint custody of their three children. Applicant 
covers half of his children’s medical insurance costs. He also pays $100 a week for 
daycare for his youngest son. (Tr. 31-33.) Applicant’s ex-wife has a new job about which 
Applicant knows little. He does not support her financially apart from the funds provided for 
the care of his children. (Tr. 35.) 
 
Applicant is repaying his 401(k) loan at $209 every two weeks. Applicant cannot 
accelerate repayment of his loan, although he can pay the balance in a lump sum.  (Tr. 45, 
53-54.) Applicant holds a salaried position, but he is paid overtime wages when 
appropriate. He expects to gross at least $120,000 in annual wages in 2014. (Tr. 46-47.) 
Applicant does not foresee any problems covering his own living costs, including rent. (Tr. 
54.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
 
 6 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The SOR alleges eight delinquencies totaling $28,368 as of April 25, 2014. The 
evidence establishes that Applicant owed about $8,325 on six accounts as of the date of 
the SOR. His 2011 mortgage default (SOR 1.f) was resolved in 2012 when his home was 
taken in foreclosure by HUD to settle the $135,539 principal balance. No evidence was 
presented showing that he was ever pursued for any deficiency balance on the loan. He 
does not dispute that his mortgage had been $17,842 past due. Available documentation 
further shows that the $2,561 charge account debt in SOR 1.e was eventually referred for 
collection to the assignee in SOR 1.b, so SOR 1.e does not represent an additional 
balance. AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
 
 7 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
has limited applicability in this case only to that debt. Applicant’s undisputed record of 
delinquency establishes both AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and 
AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s financial problems 
were more extensive than shown in the SOR. His previous car was involuntarily 
repossessed in 2012 due to nonpayment of his loan.
2
 
 
The reports of Applicant’s credit (GE 2; AE B) show that he stopped paying on most 
of the accounts in the SOR in 2011, after he and his ex-wife separated. With the exception 
of this home loan, which was resolved by foreclosure sale, his delinquencies were still 
outstanding as of April 2014. Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so 
long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not case doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply under the circumstances. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems coincide with his marital separation in September 
2010 and divorce. The record before me does not include information about his ex-wife’s 
financial contributions to the household. However, Applicant’s unrebutted testimony is that 
he continued to provide financial assistance to his ex-wife and children after they moved 
out of his home in September 2010. Starting around March 2011, Applicant was required to 
pay child support of $269 per week, which strained his finances to where he stopped 
paying on his mortgage and some credit card accounts. Divorce is a circumstance 
contemplated within AG ¶ 20(b): 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 Yet, Applicant should have been more proactive in dealing with his delinquencies, 
notwithstanding his repeated TDY assignments. Applicant did not contest the divorce,  
which was final in June 2011. He went on TDY out of the area for his employer from June 
2011 to September 2011, and he stopped paying on some of his consumer credit accounts 
that summer. He came home for two weeks in September 2011 to discover that foreclosure 
had been initiated on his home. Applicant made no effort to contact his mortgage lender or 
his other creditors while he was on TDY from September 2011 to August 2012. He earned 
15% over his usual wages during his latest TDY, so presumably he would have been 
compensated during his earlier TDY as well, whether by an increase in pay or by per diem 
or both. Applicant likely had some expenses associated with TDY, so he may not have had 
discretionary income to make payments on his old debts. However, at a minimum, he had 
                                                 
2 
The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012).

an obligation to contact his creditors and attempt to arrange repayment terms. After he 
returned from TDY around August 2012, he rented a room from a friend. Available 
information does not include an accounting of his expenses at that time. He was on TDY 
again from June 2013 to September 2013. When he returned from that assignment, 
Applicant cohabited with his ex-wife in an effort to reconcile. He had to pay child support, 
but he also did not have the costs of maintaining a separate residence. 
 
 Applicant knew about most of his delinquencies when he completed his e-QIP in 
October 2013. In December 2013, he told an OPM investigator that he intended to contact 
the creditors in SOR 1.f and 1.h in December 2013 and arrange for repayment. He 
presented no evidence of attempts to resolve his debts before the spring of 2014, when he 
inquired about borrowing from his retirement fund at work. AG ¶ 20(b) applies in that it 
explains the incurring of the delinquency. It does not fully mitigate Applicant’s delay in 
addressing his past-due debt obligations. 
 
 Applicant had two outstanding loans, and he had to pay off one of them before he 
could again borrow from his 401(k). In July 2014, with a loan of $30,000 from his 401(k) 
deposited into his bank account, Applicant satisfied the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.e (duplicated 
in SOR 1.b), and 1.h over the next few days by check or authorized debit. He paid the 
satellite television debt in SOR 1.d by credit card. His latest credit report of September 
2014 (AE B) shows that the retail charge account in SOR 1.h was also satisfied in July 
2014. He did not pay the $51 medical debt until August 2014 because the debt had been 
transferred back to the medical provider. Although belated, Applicant’s resolution of his 
debts implicates mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” 
 
  Resolution of his past-due accounts does not end the inquiry in that there must be  
adequate assurances that Applicant’s financial situation is sufficiently under control to 
where it does not pose an unacceptable security risk. To that end, Applicant has no new 
delinquent accounts. He has made timely payments on his car loan opened in January 
2013 and his child support obligation. His repayment of his 401(k) loan at $209 every other 
week is affordable and automatic. Applicant and his ex-wife have recently decided against 
reconciliation, so he will be incurring the expenses of a separate household going forward. 
However, given Applicant’s increase in his base salary from $52,000 to $81,000 annually 
since his promotion in February 2014, Applicant has the financial means to remain current 
in paying his debt obligations, whether or not overtime or TDY opportunities continue. The 
financial considerations concerns are sufficiently mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
3
 
                                                 
3 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
 9 
 
Applicant paid his debts on time before he and his ex-wife separated around 
September 2010. After he was required to pay child support at $269 per week for their 
three children, he stopped paying his mortgage and other consumer credit debts. While on 
repeated TDY, Applicant was not prevented from addressing his known debts, and he 
showed poor financial judgment in 2012 when he walked away from his home and car 
loans. However, his financial situation is now stable. Applicant satisfied most of his debts in 
July 2014 during his latest TDY. He has not opened new retail consumer credit accounts 
since the car loan in January 2013, and he has made those loan payments on time. The 
decrease in his overall debt balance reflects responsible credit management. Applicant is 
not likely to jeopardize the employment that he needs to meet his present financial 
obligations by allowing accounts to become seriously delinquent in the future. After 
reviewing the facts and circumstances before me, I conclude that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance eligibility at this time.
