Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. A 59-year-old construction superintendent,
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties that are unresolved and
ongoing. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the financial
considerations security concern. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a security clearance application on June 28,
2013. After reviewing Applicant’s application and the information gathered during a
background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD), on April 14, 2014, sent
him a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 Exhibit C was admitted provisionally or conditionally, because it was in incomplete copy of Applicant’s Social2
Security Statement and Earnings Record. After the hearing, Applicant provided a complete copy, and Exhibit
C is admitted without objections.

consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.  The1
SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the
SOR, in writing, on May 5, 2014.      
The case was assigned to me July 30, 2014, to conduct the hearing requested by
Applicant. The hearing was held as scheduled on August 27, 2014. At the hearing,
Department Counsel presented Exhibits 1–3, which were admitted. Applicant testified,
called no other witnesses, and presented Exhibits A–M, which were admitted.  The2
transcript (Tr.) was received September 8, 2014.
Ruling on Procedure
In answering the SOR, Applicant relied upon a state statute of limitations to
assert that 10 of the 12 debts alleged in the SOR were unenforceable. By definition, a
statute of limitations is simply a law that establishes a time limit for being sued or for
prosecuting a crime. Applicant referred to an unspecified statute of limitations in the
Arizona Revised Statutes, but I presume he is referring to the six-year limitation under §
12-548 for a debt collection action based on a written contract or credit card. At the
close of the hearing, I explained to Applicant that a state statute of limitations was not
binding on a federal security clearance case.  3
Indeed, the DOHA Appeal Board addressed this very point in a case involving
the Arizona statute of limitations as follows: 
Applicant’s reliance on the unenforceability of his debts under the Arizona
statute of limitations fails to demonstrate that the Judge erred. Security
clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by such statutes of
limitations. A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at
collecting an applicant’s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed
at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.
Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state
law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and

circumstances surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing
to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.4
Based on that authority, I have not considered or decided if 10 of the 12 debts in the
SOR are legally unenforceable under the applicable Arizona statute of limitations.
Accordingly, I will not discuss Applicant Exhibits F, G, H, I, K, and L, which were offered
to show the applicability of the state statute of limitations.  In addition, Exhibit E will not5
be discussed because it concerns a student loan account for Applicant’s former
daughter-in-law, which is not alleged in the SOR.6
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee who is seeking a security clearance.  He7
recalls that he held a security clearance in the 1980s when he performed work for the
State Department. He is employed as a construction or project superintendent for a
federal contractor. He has held this job since October 2012. He earns a base pay of
$99,000 annually and he has the opportunity to earn overtime at an increased rate.  He8
stated that his current income is sufficient to provide a safety net, and he estimated
having a positive net remainder of about $2,000 monthly.  9
Applicant is the primary breadwinner in his household, which consists of his
spouse, a 35-year-old daughter and her two children under the age of ten. Applicant’s
spouse is retired and receives about $780 monthly in Social Security benefits.  A victim10
of domestic violence, his adult daughter is unable to work due to a serious head injury
for which the perpetrator is serving prison time.  His daughter does not yet receive11
Social Security disability benefits, but she receives various financial benefits from the
state. As a result, Applicant provides “very limited” financial support to his daughter and
grandchildren; the support is beyond what would be normal for  grandparents.     12

Applicant’s employment history includes a number of years in which he did not
work and had no earned income. In his security clearance application, he reported a
period of unemployment from January 2001 to September 2008.  At the hearing, he13
explained that he elected not to work, and he and his spouse relied on income received
from royalty payments from a product he invented and had patented.  Applicant’s lack14
of earned income during this period is verified by his Social Security statement, which
shows zero earnings for tax years 2001–2007.15
In early 2008, Applicant’s financial situation was still stable as shown by a
January 2008 credit report.  The credit report lists a single adverse account that was16
past due once for 30 days. Otherwise, all accounts were rated satisfactory.
Applicant returned to work in 2008 because income from royalty payments
ceased in about 2005.  He worked as a superintendent for an engineering contractor17
from September 2008 to February 2011, when he was terminated. He was then
unemployed for about a year until March 2012, when he accepted a position as a
project superintendent for a mining company. He left that job in August 2012 and he
was briefly unemployed while making the transition to his current job, which he started
in October 2012. 
Applicant’s earnings during this period consist of the following: (1) for 2008, he
had taxable Social Security earnings of $21,943; (2) for 2009, he had taxable Social
Security earnings of $78,943; (3) for 2010 and 2011, there is no information available;
(4) for 2012, he had an adjusted gross income of $71,609; and (5) for 2013, he had an
adjusted gross income of $104,768.  18
The SOR alleges and there is substantial evidence to show that Applicant has a
history of financial problems or difficulties that are unresolved and ongoing. The 12
delinquent debts in the SOR total about $201,808 and consist of the following: (1) an
unpaid judgment entered against Applicant in 2013 for $20,750; (2) two medical
collection accounts for a total of $791; (3) seven collection or charged-off accounts for a
total of $92,240; and (4) two student loan accounts in collection for a total of $88,027.
The 12 delinquent debts are established by credit reports from October 2013 and March
2014.19

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied a $41 medical collection account
(SOR ¶ 1.f) on the basis that he had no records of such an account. And he denied a
$750 medical collection account (SOR ¶ 1.i) on the basis it was paid. At the hearing, he
presented no documentation to support the denial of the minor collection account, but
he had proof of payment for the $750 medical collection account.  In addition, the most20
recent credit report from March 2014 shows payment of a $4,793 medical collection
account.  Otherwise, Applicant presented no documentation showing that he had paid,21
settled, entered into a repayment agreement, disputed, or otherwise resolved the other
11 delinquent debts. 
Applicant is currently engaged in a compulsory arbitration proceeding stemming
from a collection lawsuit in which he and his wife are defendants.  The lawsuit is22
seeking to collect $28,258 on a credit card account (this debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e).
The complaint was filed in June 2014. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for mid-
September 2014, and Applicant intends to represent himself.  23
In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant attributed his
indebtedness to the 2007–2008 recession, underemployment, and unemployment. He
explained that he has not incurred new debt since 2008. He further explained that, other
than the two medical collection accounts and the two student loans, the remaining eight
debts were incurred for the purpose of building and finishing their current home, which
began in about 2000 and was completed in 2004; these were debts above and beyond
the initial construction loan.  He fell behind on paying the credit accounts sometime in24
2008 due to the lack of royalty income.  25
Applicant obtained the two student loans, the first in 2009 and the second in
2010, to pay for attending a local college as well as living expenses during his
attendance.  He did so in an effort to improve his job skills and marketability, but he did26
not complete the degree and returned to work.  
Throughout this time (2008 and forward), Applicant’s focus was on servicing his
secured debt; namely, the mortgage loans for the house he and his spouse had built

and were occupying along with his daughter and two grandchildren.  He sold what he27
described as a collection of classic cars for about $100,000, and used the proceeds for
living expenses and mortgage loan payments.  He fell behind on his mortgage for28
about six to eight months.  He disclosed this matter in his security clearance29
application, indicated that the financial issue began in about February 2011, and was
resolved in about June 2013 by a loan modification.  He stated that the mortgage loans30
are now current.31
Applicant’s intention or plan to resolve the unsecured delinquent debts is to
handle them through a legal process, in order to make certain that the creditor who is
seeking to collect is in fact the creditor entitled to the money.  To that end, he intends32
to obtain legal counsel to assist him, but he has not done so to date.   
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As33
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt34
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An35
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  36

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting37
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An38
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate39
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme40
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.41
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.42
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it43
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant44
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 45

Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  46
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the unpaid judgment, the seven collection and
charged-off accounts, and the two student loans in collection indicate inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within47 48
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and the facts also suggest a degree of financial irresponsibility.
With that said, I attach no security significance to the $41 medical collection
account, which Applicant disputes. Although he did not document the dispute, the debt
is so minor that it is of no consequence. In addition, Applicant documented his payment
of the $750 medical collection account. For those reasons, the medical collection
accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.i are decided for Applicant.   
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and49
none, individually or in combination, is sufficient to mitigate the concern stemming from
Applicant’s ongoing and unresolved financial problems. He is facing a mountain of
delinquent debt, about $200,000; he has not serviced any of this debt since sometime in
2008; and he is currently being sued for collection of one of the larger debts in the SOR.
His plan to deal with his indebtedness does not appear to be proactive or achievable in
the foreseeable future. And he has yet to retain legal counsel to assist him. 
Although Applicant stated otherwise,  it is apparent to me that his plan involves50
waiting to be sued for collection of a debt, addressing it through the court system,
relying on his state’s six-year statute of limitations, and otherwise waiting for the
adverse accounts to age off his credit report. Those actions are perfectly legal, but they
can hardly be described as making a good-faith effort to repay or resolve one’s debts.

 Understandably, he has focused on making the mortgage loan payments for the
last several years, and he deserves credit for successfully modifying the mortgage loan.
But there is no indication of a realistic plan to address the $200,000 in delinquent debt,
which is debt (minus the student loans) incurred to build and finish the home he now
occupies. Likewise, he has taken no action to resolve the delinquent student loans,
which (along with income taxes and child support) I consider to be high-priority debt. 
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the51
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.52
Here, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
and taken steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history raises doubt about his reliability,
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve that doubt in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the
whole-person concept.  In doing so, I considered Applicant’s favorable evidence.53
Nonetheless, the favorable matters are not enough to justify a conclusion that he met
his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.

Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.f, 1.i: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l:     Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
