HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling 
$64,109 and two bankruptcies. She is credited with resolving or establishing payment 
plans to address ten debts; however, she did not make sufficient progress resolving five 
debts, totaling $56,747. She has a history of not filing or fully paying her federal income 
taxes, and she failed to establish a payment plan to address her delinquent federal 
income taxes after becoming employed on January 1, 2013. Financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 9, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public trust position (SF 
86). (Item 4) On March 11, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (Item 1) 
DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such 
access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On April 7, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she waived her right to a 
hearing. (Item 3) On June 27, 2014, Department Counsel completed the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM),1 and on July 16, 2014, the FORM was provided to 
Applicant. The Applicant provided an undated response to the FORM, and on August 
19, 2014, Department Counsel indicated she did not object to my consideration of the 
FORM response. On August 28, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me.   
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d, 1.g-1.i, and 1.k-1.o, and she provided mitigating information. (Item 3) Her 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old provider data analyst employed by a defense 
contractor since September 30, 2013. (FORM response) From September 1983 to June 
1984, she “attended an accelerated program equal to 2 years/Associate degree,” and 
she received an Associate’s diploma in June 1984. (Item 4) She has not served in the 
military. (Item 4) In 1992, Applicant married, and she has three children ages 21, 34, 
and 35, and two stepchildren ages 23 and 26. (Item 4)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her SF 
86, her bankruptcy documentation, her SOR response, and her FORM response. 
Applicant described three circumstances beyond her control that contributed to her 
financial problems. (FORM response) She said she was unemployed from February 
2011 to January 2013. (Item 4) Her town increased her real estate taxes, and she could 
not afford her residence. (FORM response at 1) She had substantial bills for home 
renovations and repairs. (FORM response at 1) In 2008, her residence was sold using a 
short sale, and she had to pay rent. (FORM response at 1) She claimed her 
                                            
1The FORM describes the content of Applicant’s November 20, 2013 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) at pages 5-6, and suggests “[i]f Applicant disagrees 
with the information summarized from her Subject Interview report, please provide corrected information 
in the Reply to this Government Brief.” (FORM at 5 note 9) The file did not contain a copy of the OPM 
PSI.  Since the OPM PSI was not an exhibit or part of an exhibit and Applicant did not specifically address 
the OPM PSI in her FORM response, it will not be considered as substantive evidence.    
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

underpayments of her federal income taxes were largely due to errors using TurboTax 
software from 2007 to 2010. (FORM response at 1)    
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling $64,109 as follows: (1)-(3) 
¶ 1.a ($15,660), ¶ 1.b ($22,480), ¶ 1.c ($4,889) for federal income taxes; (4) ¶ 1.d 
($253) is a medical debt that resulted in a judgment; (5) ¶ 1.e3 ($5,035) is a 2009 
judgment; (6) ¶ 1.f ($1,242) is a 2010 judgment; (7) ¶ 1.g ($79) is an insurance 
collection debt; (8) ¶ 1.h ($275) is a medical collection debt; (9) ¶ 1.i ($347) is a medical 
collection debt; (10) ¶ 1.j ($13,465) is a student loan collection debt; (11) ¶ 1.k ($237) is

past due; (13) ¶ 1.m ($58) is a debt owed to a library; (14) ¶ 1.n states Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in August 2001 and the 
bankruptcy was dismissed with prejudice in December 2003; and (15) ¶ 1.o states 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in December 
2007, and her bankruptcy was voluntarily dismissed in January 2008. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d ($253) is a medical debt that resulted in a judgment. Applicant 
explained that she checked or planned to check the local courts to locate the debt, and 
she planned to pay the amount in full. (SOR response) She did not provide updated 
information on the disposition of this debt. (FORM response) 
 
Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($5,035) resulted from a loan from 
Applicant’s father. (FORM at 6) She said her father later withdrew the 2009 judgment, 
and the debt was paid. (FORM at 6; SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,242) is a 2010 judgment. Applicant said she paid a law firm $550, 
and she plans to pay the law firm $100 monthly until the debt is resolved. (SOR 
response) She provided proof that she made one $100 payment on April 7, 2014. 
(FORM response at 22)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($79) is an insurance collection debt. (Item 1) On April 7, 2014, 
Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. (SOR response, FORM response at 22) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($275) is a medical collection debt. (Item 1) On March 31, 2014, 
Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (SOR response, FORM response at 22)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.i ($347) is a medical collection debt. On April 7, 2014, Applicant said 
she intended to pay this debt in the next 30 days. (SOR response) When she submitted 
her FORM response, she did not include any evidence about paying this debt. (FORM 
response)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j ($13,465) is a student loan collection debt. In her SOR response, 
Applicant said, “I deny; the principal balance of $2,300 was paid multiple times over the 
                                            
3The SOR contains two subparagraphs each of 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. (Item 1) I have renumbered the 
SOR paragraphs in the sequence as they are listed in the SOR beginning with the second 1.e as 1.g. 
(Item 1)

course of ten years to various collection agencies. And I continue to get billed. . .” (SOR 
response) Applicant paid $540 in three $180 payments in May 2014, June 2014, and 
July 2014. (FORM response at 17-19)   
 
Applicant provided detailed payment data concerning her cell phone showing 
payments from July 2013 to July 2014 totaling $2,458, and she believes her cell phone 
account is current. (FORM response at 16) SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a telecommunications 
collection debt for $237. On March 31, 2014, she paid this debt. (SOR response; FORM 
response at 22)  
 
Applicant provided detailed payment data concerning her utilities showing 
payments from August 2012 to August 2014, and she believes her utilities are current. 
(FORM response at 15) SOR ¶ 1.l alleges an overdue utilities debt for $89. She is 
credited with payment of this debt. (SOR response)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.m ($58) is a debt owed to a library. Applicant paid the debt on April 3, 
2014. (SOR response; FORM response at 20)   
 
An August 12, 2014 law firm letter indicates Applicant has been a tenant in an 
apartment complex since October 2010. (FORM response at 3) She fell behind on her 
rent because of unemployment, but she kept her landlord informed about her financial 
problems. (FORM response at 3) At one point, she owed her landlord $8,000; however, 
she paid this debt, and her $1,700 monthly rent is current. (FORM response at 3) 
 
Federal Income Tax Debts 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($15,660), 1.b ($22,480), and 1.c ($4,889) allege a total of $43,029 
for federal income taxes based on tax liens in 2011 and 2013. (Item 1) Applicant’s 
October 9, 2013 SF 86 disclosed she failed to timely pay in full her federal income taxes 
for the following tax years and reasons: (1) 2005 “didn’t meet deadline” unpaid taxes 
amounted to $2,000; (2) 2007 “I don’t have a valid reason” unpaid taxes amounted to 
$7,000; (3) 2008 “error with my turbo tax submission” unpaid taxes amounted to $3,000; 
(4) 2009 “didn’t have funds/no excuse” unpaid taxes amounted to $5,000; (5) 2010 
“didn’t pay the hardship penalty on the 401k, according to the IRS, the tax was paid but 
not the penalty” unpaid taxes amounted to $3,000; and (6) 2011 “lost my employment; 
made some payments but not in full” unpaid taxes amounted to $2,000. (Item 4)4 
However, in each instance she said she had “worked out an installment agreement,” 
“worked out a combined installment agreement,” or “worked out a total combined 
payment agreement on the years that were not paid in full.” (Item 4)  
 
Applicant said the IRS assessed her with a $3,000 penalty for withdrawing funds 
from her 401(k) to pay for her son’s college. (FORM at 5) Applicant said the IRS 
                                            
4Applicant said she paid her 2011 and 2012 taxes in full and on time. (SOR response) She said 
the IRS incorrectly keyed $3,193 as interest, when the correct amount was $31.93, and the amount plus 
penalties were removed from her tax bill. (SOR response) 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
subsequently withdrew the $3,000 penalty. (FORM at 5) She said she paid the $2,000 
owed for tax year 2011. (FORM at 5)  
 
Applicant paid the IRS $900 in 2011 ($300 in October, November, December) 
and $1,800 in 2012 ($300 in January, February, March, April, May, June) to address her 
2005 and 2007 delinquent taxes. (FORM response at 6-14)5 On November 10, 2013, 
she paid $1,248, and she resolved her state tax debt for tax year 2010. (Item 4, FORM 
response at 5; non-SOR debt)   
 
On January 1, 2013, Applicant was hired as a provider data analyst after being 
unemployed from February 2011 to January 2013. (Item 4) On September 30, 2013, 
she was hired by her current employer. (FORM response at 1) In February 2014, she 
said she hired a company to negotiate with the IRS concerning resumption of her 
payment plan, which was terminated in 2012. (SOR response) This company was 
unable to establish an adequate payment plan, and she is “now in the final phase of 
submitting the appropriate paperwork such as financial statements and moving forward 
with the monthly installations agreement. Per the agreement, after three consecutive 
months of payments, the federal liens will be released.” (FORM response at 1)   
 
There is no evidence that Applicant paid the IRS anything in the past 18 months 
to address the delinquent tax allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, even though she was 
employed during this period. 
 
Bankruptcies 
 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
August 2001 and the bankruptcy was dismissed with prejudice in December 2003. 
(SOR ¶ 1.n) Applicant said she paid her creditors, and bankruptcy was no longer 
required. (SOR response) Applicant received some financial counseling in connection 
with her bankruptcy. 
 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
December 2007, and the bankruptcy was voluntarily dismissed in January 2008. (SOR 
¶ 1.o) She said the bankruptcy was filed by mistake, and when she learned of the error, 
the bankruptcy was dismissed. (SOR response) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
                                            
5She noted on the front of her checks in 2011 and 2012 that her payments to the IRS were to 
address debts for tax years 2005 and 2007. (FORM response at 6-14) 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, her October 29, 2013 SF 86, her SOR response, and her FORM 
response. Applicant’s SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, totaling $64,109 and two 
bankruptcy filings. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;6 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).

6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. AG ¶ 20(b) has some applicability. She described three 
circumstances beyond her control: (1) she was unemployed from February 2011 to 
January 2013; (2) her town increased her real estate taxes, and she could not afford her 
residence; and (3) her underpayments of her taxes were largely due to errors using 
TurboTax software from 2007 to 2010. Her problems with TurboTax software do not 
fully explain the magnitude of her delinquent tax bill. She did not provide enough details 
about her income and tax returns and what she did after becoming employed in January 
2013 to address her delinquent debts to establish that she “acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.”    
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating several SOR debts. She stated she paid the 
debt to her father in SOR ¶ 1.d. Her assertion is accepted as accurate, even though she 
did not provide any corroborating evidence of payment. She provided proof that she 
paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. Her reasons for filing her 
bankruptcies in 2003 and 2007 and for dismissing those bankruptcies in 2003 and 2008 
are reasonable. She made payments to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f, and she stated she 
paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i. The debts and bankruptcies alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e to 1.i, 
and 1.k to 1.o are mitigated. 
 
Applicant has been employed since January 1, 2013, and she has not made any 
payments after becoming employed to address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($15,660), 1.b 
($22,480), and 1.c ($4,889), which total $43,029 for federal income taxes based on tax 
liens in 2011 and 2013. She did not provide any evidence of progress addressing the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($253). In 2014, she paid $540 to address her student loan collection 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($13,465) after denying responsibility for it in her SOR response. Her 
student loan payments over the last 18 months are insufficient to fully mitigate this debt.     
 
Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide 
sufficient information about her finances to establish her inability to make greater 
progress on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, and 1.j after becoming employed on January 
1, 2013. Applicant received some financial counseling in connection with her 
bankruptcy; however, she did not establish that there are clear indications that her 
financial problems are being resolved or are under control, and will not occur in the 
future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 54-year-old provider data analyst employed by a defense contractor since 
September 30, 2013. She received an Associate’s diploma in June 1984. In 1992, 
Applicant married, and she has three children ages 21, 34, and 35, and two stepchildren 
ages 23 and 26. There is no evidence that Applicant abused alcohol or used illegal 
drugs. She contributes to her company and the Department of Defense. There is no 
evidence of criminal offenses, disloyalty, or that she would intentionally violate national 
security. She paid or established payment plans, and she has mitigated 10 SOR debts. 
Her bankruptcies were reasonable approaches to address her financial problems. She 
paid her landlord for back rent of about $8,000. Some circumstances beyond her 
control, especially unemployment, adversely affected her finances.   
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. She has been 
employed since January 1, 2013, and she has not made any payments after becoming 
employed to address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($15,660), 1.b ($22,480), and 1.c 
($4,889), which total $43,029 for federal income taxes based on tax liens in 2011 and 
2013. She did not provide any evidence of progress addressing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d 
($253). In 2014, she paid $540 to address her student loan collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.j 
($13,465) after denying responsibility for it in her SOR response.  She has made a good 
start addressing her student loan debt; however, in light of her financial history 
consistent monthly payments for more than three months are necessary to fully mitigate 
her student loan debt. 
    
Applicant received notice in the SOR that her financial problems raised 
trustworthiness concerns. She could have made greater progress resolving or 
attempting to resolve her federal income tax liens. Her failure to show greater progress 
by establishing a payment plan with the IRS shows lack of financial responsibility and 
judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
and ability to protect sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. More financial progress is 
necessary to fully mitigate trustworthiness concerns. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are

not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a public 
trust position at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e to 1.i:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k to 1.o:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
