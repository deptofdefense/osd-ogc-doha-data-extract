HOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: 
 
On December 4, 2012, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 18, 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) 
issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 25, 2013. He answered the 
SOR in writing on September 2, 2013, and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received the request on 
September 12, 2013. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 21, 
2013, and I received the case assignment on October 24, 2013. DOHA issued a Notice 
of Hearing on November 27, 2013, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
 
2 
 
 
December 23, 2013. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received 
without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through E, without 
objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 3, 2014. 
 
Pursuant to the SOR amendment, discussed below, I allowed Applicant until 
January 24, 2014, to submit additional documents addressing the amended language in 
the SOR. On that date Applicant requested additional time to submit his 2011 and 2012 
income tax documents. I gave him until noon on February 12, 2014, to submit those 
documents. He again was unable to complete his filing by that date, so I gave him until 
5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 14, 2014, to submit his documents. He did 
so. The Government had no objection to the documents. I marked copies of his emailed 
requests and income tax forms as Exhibits F to Exhibit O.  
 
The record closed February 14, 2014. Based upon a review of the pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings 
 
Motion to Amend SOR 
 
Department Counsel moved at the hearing to amend the SOR by changing ¶ 2.d, 
alleging Applicant failed to file his state and Federal income forms for 2008 to 2012 
(instead of 2010 and 2011 as originally alleged) and failed to pay his taxes for the same 
years as required by law. (Tr. at 69, 70) I granted the motion to amend after Applicant 
stated he had no objection to the amendment (Tr. 71).  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 
and 1.d of the SOR, as originally alleged, with explanations. He denied the factual 
allegations in ¶ 1.b of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his 
request for eligibility for a security clearance.   
 
 Applicant is 49 years old, married but previously divorced from his first wife. He 
has two children and is the stepfather of another child. (Tr. 26-29; Exhibit 1) 
 
 Applicant worked as a federal contractor for a number of years. During those 
times he had a security clearance. He is now a program manager for a federal 
contractor. Applicant earns about $151,000 annually. His wife started a new job in 
November 2013 after being laid off from her previous job in September 2012. She now 
earns $49 an hour for a total of about $101,000 annually. Her previous position paid 
$120,000. (Tr. 22-29, 50-52; Exhibits 1 and 4) 
 
 Applicant’s wife suffered from post-partum depression after the birth of their child 
in 1999, according to his testimony. The death of her minor goddaughter in 2005 also 
depressed her. Between 2009 and 2011 his wife suffered from severe depression. No 
 
3 
 
 
copies of any medical records documenting these conditions were submitted. (Tr. 19, 
20; Exhibit 1; Answer) 
 
 Applicant allowed his wife to manage the household finances. During that time 
she did not pay the house mortgage for about 11 months. He restarted payments in 
November 2013. (Tr. 20, 21; Exhibits 1-3) 
 
 Applicant did not pay a credit card debt of $15,000 listed in ¶1.a of the SOR. He 
started making payments in November 2013 of $284 monthly. He intends to continue 
making those payments until the debt is paid. Applicant did not submit any documents 
showing the installment payment agreement. The debt is being resolved. (Tr. 27-31; 
Exhibits 1-3) 
 
 Applicant owed another credit card debt for $5,370 that was reduced to a 
judgment and finally collected through garnishment action (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant put 
his wife in charge of paying the household debts and she failed to do so. This debt was 
not paid regularly and Applicant received a telephone call from the creditor or collector 
that finally put him on notice that the debt was due. Garnishment then occurred. The 
debt is paid. (Tr. 30-32; Exhibits 1-4; Answer attachment) 
 
 Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on April 2, 2012 
(SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant dismissed the petition on April 18, 2012. There are 50 creditors 
listed in the bankruptcy petition. No total amount of debt is shown in the documents 
presented by the Department Counsel. (Exhibit 5) 
 
 Applicant did not file his state and Federal income taxes for 2008-2011 on time 
as required by law. The original SOR alleges non-filing for the years 2010 and 2011. 
The amended SOR added the years 2008, 2009, and 2012, none of which Applicant 
filed or paid on time as required by law. (Tr. 33-43, 57-60, 65, 66-68; Exhibits 1-4, F to 
O; Answer attachment) 
 
 Applicant did not disclose his failure to file his returns, and the subsequent tax 
debt, for the 2008 and 2009 income tax years to the Government in the interview with 
the investigator January to March 2013. On his e-QIP in Question 26 Applicant 
disclosed only that his 2010 income taxes were late in being filed, but were resolved at 
present. He did not disclose any other years of delinquency. Nor did he disclose that his 
state tax forms were not filed or that he owed money for his taxes. (Tr. 33-43, 57-60, 65, 
66-68; Exhibits 1-4, F to O; Answer attachment) 
 
 Applicant testified he filed the tax returns for 2008 to 2010 in 2012. He recalls he 
owes about $2,000 on his 2008 Federal income tax but has not paid it. He thinks he 
owes $75 on his state income for the same period. His accountant is reviewing the 
numbers. Applicant testified he may owe up to $5,000 for his 2009 federal income 
taxes. The 2010 and 2011 tax returns were filed in April 2013 but he has not paid any 
tax due beyond what money was withheld by his employer. Applicant’s September 3, 
2013 Answer states the 2010 tax forms were filed and the 2011 tax forms were to be 
 
4 
 
 
filed in August 2013. (Tr. 33-43, 57-60, 65, 66-68; Exhibits 1-4, F to O; Answer 
attachment) 
 
 Applicant’s 2010 federal income tax form shows an adjusted gross income of 
$271,968. His income in 2011 was $409,514 and in 2012 it was $300,869. His 
additional income taxes owed for 2010 as shown on his Answer attachment is $11,974. 
He owes $47,215 more tax for 2011. His additional tax owed for 2012 is $27,211. 
Adding the tax debts from 2009 through 2012 it totals about $55,563.66. (Tr. 33-43, 57-
60, 65, 66-68; Exhibits 1-4, F to O; Answer attachment) He submitted the tax transcripts 
from the IRS showing his 2009 and 2010 federal income taxes were filed. He owes 
$6,005.69 for 2009 and $18,057.97 for 2010. Applicant wants to file an offer and 
compromise with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle all of his tax debts 
because he says he cannot pay the total tax owed for all the years of $110,463.66. 
Applicant testified he lives from paycheck to paycheck and has no savings. (Tr. 41-44; 
Exhibits L to O) 
 
 Applicant filed his state income tax form for 2010 in November 2013. Applicant 
does not know how much money he owes to his home state on that tax debt. He has 
now filed his 2011 state income tax forms. He does not know how much money he 
owes on that tax return. He has now filed his 2012 state income tax forms. Applicant 
started to work with his accountant on the past due tax forms and debts in November 
2013.  
 
 Applicant used money from his Section 401(k) retirement account to pay the 
arrearages in his delinquent mortgage to avoid foreclosure. He consulted with Green 
Path financial counseling service to learn how to better manage his money starting in 
the summer of 2013. He did not have a copy of the agreement he signed with that 
company. Green Path has not “interacted” with any creditor to resolve any debt. 
Applicant paid them $150. He retained the Lexington Law Firm the week before the 
hearing to review his credit score and to help improve it. (Tr. 20, 47, 48, 61-63; Exhibits 
1 and E; Answer) 
 
 Applicant submitted four character letters from his work colleagues. They have 
known him for four to twelve years. They consider Applicant trustworthy and 
professional. These co-workers are aware of Applicant’s financial problems and still 
consider him worthy of a security clearance. (Exhibits A to D) 
 
 Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) shows a net monthly income of 
$11,326 from him and his wife. Their monthly expenses are $7,646. They pay four 
debts, including their mortgage, student loan, auto loan (30 days late), and the ¶ 1.a 
debt of $15,000 with $2,515 of their income, leaving $1,165 for other expenses. They 
have savings of $1,200. Their other assets are their two autos and the house they own. 
Their PFS does not show they are paying any other debts or their delinquent taxes.  
(Exhibit E)

 His wife has two credit cards that are late being paid. One debt is for $20,000 
and the other card debt is charged off by the creditor. He has three delinquent medical 
debts owed for the past 12 to 16 months, for a debt of $2,100. (Tr. 44-46) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process (AG ¶ 2(a)). The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration 
of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
 
6 
 
 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline at AG ¶ 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise 
security concerns.  Three conditions are applicable to the facts found in this case: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
Applicant accumulated $20,370 in delinquent consumer debt from 2004 to the 
present time that remains unpaid.  Applicant has two delinquent debts listed in the SOR, 
failed to file state and federal income tax forms for 2008 to 2012 as required by law, has 
not paid his income taxes as also required, and has one terminated bankruptcy petition.  
 
The guideline in AG ¶ 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Two conditions may be applicable:   
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce  or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, 
 
 (f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. 
  
Applicant is paying his $15,000 credit union debt on a monthly basis of $284 for 
the past two months. His lack of documentation about the payments is troubling, but it 
seems likely he is paying this debt on the installment basis. AG ¶ 20 (d) has partial 
application to this debt.  
 
Applicant’s debt to a credit card issuer was not paid voluntarily. The money was 
garnished after the creditor obtained a judgment. The debt is resolved, but Applicant did 
not make a good-faith effort to pay it himself. No mitigating condition applies.   
 
Applicant claims he filed his 2008 to 2011 income tax returns. He does not know, 
or cannot state accurately, how much tax money he owes to his home state and the 
U.S. government. Reviewing his various exhibits shows the debt is about $55,563.66 to 
the IRS alone. His 2009 to 2012 income taxes for both governments are still not paid. 
Applicant wants to make an offer and compromise to the federal government for his 
taxes. The status of his state taxes remains unclear.  It is clear he has not paid at least 
four years of federal and state taxes. His joint annual income exceeds $250,000 but he 
only has $1,200 in savings. Applicant spends money excessively and does not pay his 
income taxes, except the amount his employer withholds. No mitigating condition 
applies. 
 
Applicant’s attempts at financial counseling are late and have not produced any 
affirmative results. The tax and financial problems exhibited by the 50 creditors listed in 
his terminated bankruptcy filing are not under control. AG ¶ 20 (c) does not apply.  
 
Filing a bankruptcy petition and later dismissing it is within the discretion of 
Applicant. However, his actions do show he has a large number of creditors and he did 
not demonstrate any plan to resolve all his debts, especially his state and federal 
income tax debts.  
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the “whole-person concept,” the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 AG ¶ 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG ¶ 
2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a professional and his 
wife is also. They earn a very high salary compared to many people in the United 
States. Yet they have not filed or paid their personal incomes for four years. Applicant 
also testified he lives from paycheck to paycheck on his high income. He did not explain 
where his money goes. However, it is clear he does not pay his income tax beyond 
what his employer withholds pursuant to law.  
 
His explanation of that failure and lack of precision about the amount owed is not 
credible or persuasive. Applicant clearly spends money excessively. He blames his wife 
for not paying the bills. She is depressed, he testified, but working at a good job now. 
Applicant did not submit any medical documents to verify his assertions about his wife’s 
mental and emotional conditions.  
 
I do not find Applicant to be a responsible person regarding his financial 
obligations, especially meeting his tax requirements. Yet he wants a security clearance 
to have access to government information developed with other people’s tax money.   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
