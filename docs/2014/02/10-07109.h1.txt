DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant rebutted the Guideline J (criminal conduct) allegation and mitigated the 
security concerns arising from the Guideline E (personal conduct) allegation. Clearance 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  
(e-QIP) on April 22, 2010. On October 1, 2013, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J and E. DOD CAF acted 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 
1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on 
September 1, 2006.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On October 21, 2013, 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  
 
This case was assigned to me on December 19, 2013. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Notice of Hearing on December 19, 2013. 
The hearing was conducted in sessions held on January 9 and 31, 2014. During the first 
session, Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, while Applicant 
testified, called two witnesses, and offered no exhibits. At the second session, 
Department Counsel offered GE 6 and 7 and Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through 
K. The record was left open until February 7, 2014, for Applicant to submit additional 
matters. Applicant timely submitted AE L through Y. All proffered exhibits were admitted 
into evidence without objection. Email exchanges between Applicant, Department 
Counsel, and me have been marked as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1. Department Counsel’s 
written argument was marked as HE 2. DOHA received the transcript of the first session 
(Tr1.) on January 17, 2014, and the second session (Tr2.) on February 10, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active 
duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1985 to 1992 and then served in the Air National Guard 
and Air Force Reserve until 2008. He retired from military service in the grade of 
technical sergeant (E-6) and will be eligible for Reserve retired pay at age 60. He 
obtained a bachelor’s degree in 2013. He married in 1990 and divorced in 2002. He 
married again in 2005. He has two children, ages 8 and 25, and a stepchild, age 15. He 
held a security clearance in the Air Force without incident.1 
 
The SOR contains one allegation under Guideline J that asserted Applicant was 
charged with four felony counts of residential mortgage fraud in October 2011 and that, 
after he agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, those charges were placed on a 
“dead docket” in January 2012 and nolle prossed in October 2012. This allegation was 
cross-alleged as the sole Guideline E allegation. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted the Guideline J allegation and denied the Guideline E allegation. His 
admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact.2 
 
Applicant lived overseas from about 1996 to 2005 and operated a successful 
business there specializing in home automation systems. When he returned to the 
United State in 2005, he operated a similar business here for about five years. Since 
then, his business in the United States closed, but he still provides consulting services 
for clients interested in such systems. In April 2010, he began working for a defense

contractor as an information technology technician. He now works overseas for another 
defense contractor as a integration technician.3 
 
In 1991, Applicant purchased his first home in the United States for $54,000 
while he was serving in the Air Force. In 1996, he sold that home for about $103,000. 
When he returned from overseas in 2005, his assets consisted of about $425,000 in a 
bank account. Soon after he returned, he purchased his second home (hereinafter 
referred to as “625 HO”) in which he made a down payment of $28,000 and took out a 
$355,000 mortgage loan. This was his primary residence from May 2005 to September 
2009.4 
 
The residential mortgage fraud charges brought against Applicant arose from 
real estate purchases arranged by Mr. S, who was a real estate agent. Mr. S lived in 
Applicant’s neighborhood and had a son who was about the same age of Applicant’s 
son. Applicant’s and Mr. S’s sons became friends, which led to Applicant becoming a 
friend of Mr. S. As their friendship developed over time, Applicant grew to trust Mr. S 
and advised him that he was interested in flipping homes to generate income. In early 
2007, Mr. S assisted Applicant in purchasing two fixer-upper properties (1050 HP and 
6020 RC) that were the basis of the residential mortgage fraud charges.5 
 
Before the purchases, Mr. S showed Applicant the two fixer-upper properties and 
advised him of the purchase prices of comparable properties. At that point, Applicant 
decided to buy. Mr. S made arrangements with banks for Applicant to submit mortgage 
loan applications. Mr. S. also arranged the property appraisals and real estate closings. 
The same appraiser and attorney were used for both closings. The closings took place 
at the attorney’s office.6  
 
On January 9, 2007, Applicant purchased 526 RS for $875,000 by obtaining a 
first mortgage loan of $700,000 and a second mortgage loan of $175,000. On the day 
before the sale, this property was appraised at $875,000. On February 12, 2007, 
Applicant purchased 1050 HP for $1,100,000 by obtaining a first mortgage loan of 
$880,000 and a second mortgage loan of about $130,000. On January 22, 2007, 1050 
HP was appraised at $1,100,000.7  
 
Applicant indicated that, at the closings, he quickly signed various documents 
without reading many of them. Specifically, he unwittingly signed documents indicating

that he intended to occupy each house as his primary residence and signed documents 
reporting inaccurate information about his monthly income. He also testified that a 
number of his purported signatures and initials on the loan applications and closing 
documents were not his, but were forgeries. Mr. S did not appear at the closings and his 
name does not appear on any of the closing documents.8 
 
After Applicant purchased the two fixer-upper properties, he began making 
repairs to them. Mr. S assisted him in identifying contractors to work on the properties. 
He began making monthly mortgage payments of about $6,200 on each property and 
continued doing so until his money ran out in 2008. As he began experiencing financial 
difficulties, Applicant’s relationship with Mr. S deteriorated, and he decided to hire a real 
estate agent in an attempt to sell the properties. In about September 2007, he listed the 
properties for sale, but was unable to sell them.9 
 
As his financial problems worsened, Applicant started using credit cards to make 
mortgage loan payments and pay other bills. In 2008, Applicant hired a company to 
negotiate a reduction in his credit card payments. He, however, became overwhelmed 
with his indebtedness and made his last mortgage loan payments in early 2008. On 
November 21, 2008, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His bankruptcy was 
converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding on January 23, 2009. The bankruptcy petition 
listed that Applicant had $2,476,000 in assets and $3,706,456 in liabilities. Schedule A 
listed the following real estate holdings:

10 In September 2007, Applicant purchased the 6020 RC property. A relative made a down 
payment of $50,000 on that property. Applicant’s mother occupied this house. The mortgage on this 
property was the only debt reaffirmed during Applicant’s bankruptcy. He tried to catch up with this 
mortgage following the bankruptcy and attempted to renegotiate a new mortgage, but was unable to do 
so. In April 2013, Applicant eventually sold 6020 RC through a short sale with the agreement of the 
mortgage holder. Following the short sale, his mother began renting the property from the new owner. 
See Tr1. at 130-133; GE 2, 5. 
11 In May 2007, Applicant bought an undeveloped lot (7072 BW). He acquired a $425,000 
construction-to-permanent loan and built a home on that lot. He planned to use this home as a showcase 
for his home automation systems. See Tr1. at 77-79, 109-110.

The bankruptcy petition also listed that Applicant had 17 credit card debts totaling 
$100,659 and a monthly income of $7,350. Applicant received a bankruptcy discharge 
on May 13, 2009.12 
  
 On September 16, 2011, state law enforcement authorities indicted Applicant on 
four felony counts of residential mortgage fraud. These charges alleged that Applicant, 
with the intent to defraud, knowingly made deliberate omissions or misrepresentations 
during the mortgage lending process for the purchase of 526 RC (two counts) and 1050 
HP (two counts). The omissions allegedly involved him failing to disclose that he would 
be paid illegally a portion of the proceeds from the sale of those properties, while the 
misrepresentations allegedly involved him falsely declaring that he would occupy the 
properties as his primary residence.13 
 
Applicant was overseas when he learned of his indictment. He voluntarily 
returned to the United States to face the charges. He cooperated with investigators. He 
explained his involvement in the real estate purchases and contended that he was not 
involved in any fraudulent scheme. He signed an agreement to cooperate with law 
enforcement authorities and, with the court’s consent, the charges were placed on the 
dead docket on January 12, 2012 and were nolle prossed in October 2012. On 
November 26, 2012, Applicant applied to have the charges expunged from his record.14 
 
During the police investigation, Applicant learned that the seller of 526 RS had 
purchased that property for $405,000 the day before Applicant bought it for $875,000 
and that 1050 HP was first sold for $432,000 earlier on the same day that Applicant 
bought it for $1,100,000. The seller of one property was married to the seller of the 
other property, but Applicant did not know they were married because they had different 
last names. Applicant indicated that, after those transactions, the profits from the sales 
were split among various people. He did not know how the proceeds were split or who 
received them, but he presumed Mr. S received some of the proceeds. Applicant 
testified that he did not receive any of those proceeds. Throughout this matter, he has 
claimed that he was a victim in the residential mortgage fraud scheme.15 
 
At the hearing in this case, a witness testified that he met Mr. S in about 2002. 
He lived two doors from Mr. S and served on the board of directors of the homeowners 
association. Overtime, the witness and Mr. S became good friends. Mr. S 
recommended the witness invest with him by purchasing undeveloped property located 
at a lake. The property was being offered for sale at $1,100,000. One morning, Mr. S 
told the witness that he needed $200,000 as soon as possible to secure the property.

The witness informed Mr. S that it might take him a couple of days to obtain that money. 
Mr. S then asked how much money the witness could get his hands on that morning. 
Mr. S’s aggressiveness made the witness nervous. At that point, the witness decided 
that it would be best not to become involved financially with Mr. S. The witness also 
indicated that Mr. S was later evicted from his home in the neighborhood. The witness 
said that he has not had any contact with Mr. S in the past two years, but saw him once 
or twice in the neighborhood during that period.16 
 
Another witness testified that he purchased an investment property for $700,000 
with the assistance of Mr. S in 2007. Mr. S made all the arrangements for the loan 
application and closing. Mr. S also indicated that he had renters for that property. It was 
later learned that the seller of this investment property was also the seller of one of 
Applicant’s properties. Soon after purchasing the property, the witness had difficulty 
contacting Mr. S. The witness hired a private investigator and attorney and instituted a 
lawsuit against Mr. S. The witness, however, eventually filed bankruptcy and was 
advised to dismiss the lawsuit during the bankruptcy proceeding. This witness described 
Applicant as the most honest man he has ever met.17 
 
Department Counsel submitted a press advisory from law enforcement officials 
indicating that ten individuals were charged in similar residential mortgage fraud 
schemes. Another press advisory indicated that the appraiser of 526 RS and 1050 HP 
pled guilty to fraud offenses in November 2011. Applicant indicated that the attorney’s 
office where the real estate closing took place was raided by the police and closed.18 
 
At the hearing, Applicant testified in an open, honest, and forthcoming manner. 
He did not dodge any questions and was a credible witness. He admitted that he used 
poor judgment and failed to exercise due diligence in purchasing the properties. He 
acknowledged that he acted in an irresponsible manner by not reading many of the 
documents at that closing. He also indicated that, although he had no criminal intent, he 
played a role as the mark in the scheme by signing the documents and obtaining the 
homes.  He further noted that, in the past seven years, he has exercised due diligence 
and achieved financial stability.19 
 
Applicant provided character reference letters from friends, coworkers, and 
supervisors indicating that Applicant is honest, dependable, and trustworthy. He was 
described a professional with impeccable character. One letter noted that he strictly 
adhered to security regulations in handling classified information. His work evaluations

for the past two years reflected that his performance exceeded requirements or was 
exceptional, which were the two highest performance categories.20 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
                                                          
20 AE L- X.

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
Two disqualifying conditions under criminal conduct AG ¶ 31 are potentially 
applicable in this case: 
 
(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  
 
(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. 
 
 In 2007, Applicant was charged with four felony counts of residential mortgage 
fraud. Those charges were later dismissed. Applicant cooperated with authorities 
throughout this matter. He established that he was a victim of a fraudulent scheme. 
While he signed documents that contained inaccurate information, he did not realize 
what he was signing at that time and had no intent to defraud. He has rebutted the 
criminal conduct allegation. None of the above disqualifying conditions apply. 
Alternatively, sufficient evidence was presented to establish the mitigating condition in 
AG ¶ 32(c), i.e., evidence that the person did not commit the offense. I find in favor of 
Applicant under Guideline J. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
 
9 
 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: 
 
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of 
client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, 
unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other 
government protected information; and 
* * * 
(3) a pattern of dishonesty or  rule violations. 
 
 During two real estate closings in 2007, Applicant failed to read important 
documents and signed documents that contained incorrect and misleading information. 
Those documents may have been relied upon by banks in granting him mortgages 
loans. In purchasing those and other properties, he overextended himself financially, 
which resulted in him eventually filing bankruptcy. He admitted that he acted 
irresponsibly and failed to exercise due diligence in purchasing those properties. AG ¶ 
16(d) applies.   
 
AG ¶ 17 lists three personal conduct mitigating conditions that are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. 
 
10 
 
 
Applicant was a victim in a residential mortgage fraud scheme. He trusted others 
who took advantage of him. He has accepted responsibility for not acting responsibly in 
those real estate transactions. He has learned a tough lesson. His questionable conduct 
occurred over seven years ago under unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. 
Since then, he has achieved financial stability and acted in a responsible manner. AG 
¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant served in the Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve for 
23 years. He is a responsible husband and parent. He is a valued employee. Friend, 
coworkers, and supervisors attest to his honorable character. He has shown that he is 
reliable and trustworthy. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has 
rebutted the criminal conduct allegation and mitigated the security concerns under the 
personal conduct allegation. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:       
 
11 
 
 
    Paragraph 1, Guideline J:     FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance 
for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
