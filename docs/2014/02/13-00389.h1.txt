GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding drug involvement, alcohol 
consumption, and financial considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access 
to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 12, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On March 4, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued 
him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on March 22, 2013.2 
On an unspecified date, the DOD issued him another set of interrogatories. He 
responded to the interrogatories on March 22, 2013.3 On an unspecified date, the DOD 
issued him another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on March

23, 2013.4 On an unspecified date, the DOD issued him another set of interrogatories. 
He responded to the interrogatories on March 24, 2013.5 On May 16, 2013, the DOD 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), G (Alcohol Consumption), and F 
(Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 10, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated June 
18, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on August 12, 2013. The case was assigned to me on August 19, 2013. A 
Notice of Hearing was initially issued on December 3, 2013, but amended on December 
6, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 17, 2013.6  
 
During the hearing, 7 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and 16 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE P) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 2, 2014. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were marked as Applicant 
exhibits (AE Q through AE AO) and admitted into evidence without objection. The 
record closed on January 10, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under drug involvement (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.), one factual allegation under alcohol 
consumption (¶ 2.a.), portions of other factual allegations under alcohol consumption 
(¶¶ 2.b. and 2.c.), as well as four allegations under financial conditions (¶¶ 3.a., 3.c.,

 The Directive established that notification as to the time and place of a hearing be furnished to an applicant 
at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, Department 
Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the actual Notice of 
Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and the hearing was less 
than 15 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant specifically waived the 15-day 
notice requirement. See, Tr. at 15.

3.d., and 3.f.). He denied the remaining allegations or portions thereof. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as the chief operating officer with his current employer since June 2007, but 
because of issues discussed further below which have caused a major rupture in his 
relationship with his partner, he continues to play a very small role in the company.7 He 
was an enlisted member of the National Guard from 2007 to 2012, and was on active 
duty with the U.S. Army from January 1997 until March 2006, and again from January 
2009 until March 2009.8 Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in May 
2002.9 He received a General Educational Development (GED) diploma in 1993,10 
attended college for about one semester, and is currently enrolled in another college 
program.11 Applicant was married the first time in January 1998, and divorced in 
January 2000. He married his second wife in June 2002, and they divorced in March 
2013.12 Applicant and his second wife have one daughter, born in August 2003.13  
 
Military Service 
 
 Trained by the U.S. Army as an engineer, infantryman, parachutist, scuba diver, 
and ranger, Applicant was deployed on four occasions, including deployments to Haiti, 
Egypt, and twice to Afghanistan. During his military service, he was awarded the Silver 
Star (for gallantry in action during a combined joint special operation in Afghanistan),the 
Bronze Star Medal (two awards), the Purple Heart, the Joint Service Commendation 
Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Army 
Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal (two awards), the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, the Non-Commissioned Officer 
Professional Development Ribbon (two awards), the Army Service Ribbon, the 
Multinational Force and Observers medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary

Medical Issues  
 
As a direct result of the service-connected injuries that Applicant received in 
Afghanistan for which he was awarded the Purple Heart, as well as other combat-
related issues, in May 2012, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) concluded 
that Applicant had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to include substance abuse, 
as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI), and granted him a 50 percent disability rating, 
effective May 26, 2011.15 Among the symptoms for such a rating are: flattened affect; 
panic attacks more than once a week; impairment of short- and long-term memory; 
impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; 
and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective and social relationships.16 On 
December 1, 2012, his service-connected evaluation was increased to 70 percent.17 
Among the symptoms for such an increased rating are: deficiencies in work, family 
relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to suicidal ideation; impaired impulse 
control; and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances.18 As a result of his 
increased disability, Applicant receives a monthly monetary award of $1,293.19 In 
November 2013, Applicant entered a Trauma Recovery Program (TRP) under the 
direction of a psychologist and a social worker.20 
 
 Although he had been wounded in combat during his 2005 deployment, and had 
secretly been struggling with PTSD since that time, Applicant was reluctant to admit he 
was injured, and believing he could still do his job, he volunteered for another 
deployment. Upon his return, he realized the “horrible stigma” it was having PTSD, and 
he decided to leave the military.21 He was reluctant to admit his physical and emotional 
maladies, and was under tremendous stress and pain, and unable to sleep. When 
Applicant was examined by the DVA, the examiner noted that his PTSD included 
“bitterness, jumpiness, often angry, do not like being near people, ashamed, guilty

improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and as such, he was awarded two Purple Heart Medals.

feelings, seclusion, sleep difficulties, hypervigilance and anxiety.”22 He also noted that 
Applicant’s alcohol abuse began prior to traumatic abuse occurring but worsened over 
time and includes excessive use and continued use despite negative consequences; 
the substance abuse is related to Axis I diagnosis of PTSD; and it was exacerbated by 
PTSD symptoms.23 
 
Drug Involvement  
 
Applicant had used marijuana on an unspecified number of occasions when he 
was a young teenager, but abstained from further marijuana use throughout his entire 
active duty military career, and thereafter until mid-2011.24 However, in an effort to 
relieve his stress and pain, as well as to enable him to sleep, Applicant started to self-
medicate, initially using alcohol, but later using marijuana as well, to do so.25 During the 
relatively brief period from May 2011 until July 2011, Applicant smoked one marijuana 
“joint” per week in an effort to reduce his stress, manage his pain, and enable him to 
sleep. The marijuana had a calming effect, made him more relaxed, and helped him 
sleep.26 However, on the negative side, the marijuana impaired his judgment, made him 
paranoid, and impacted his relationship with his girlfriend.27  
 
During the period of his marijuana use, Applicant never purchased, sold, 
supplied, manufactured, or grew the marijuana.28 Instead, he had a friend – a former 
military buddy who was coping with the same medical issues – who periodically offered 
Applicant the marijuana for free.29 
 
Commencing in May 2011, Applicant was screened for substance use disorder 
and enrolled in the out-patient treatment program of the chemical addictions 
rehabilitation program (CARP) at a DVA clinic and a DVA medical center. He completed 
a Seeking Safety Group program at the medical center in November 2011,30 and in 
February 2012, completed 90 hours of substance abuse disorder specific treatment at 
the DVA clinic.31 There is no evidence that Applicant was ever diagnosed with drug 
abuse or drug dependence. Applicant contends that his marijuana use was actually a

small part of his alcohol abuse.32 At some point during his DVA treatment for the 
alcohol-related issues, and finally recognizing substance abuse is not healthy and is 
illegal, Applicant decided to stop using all such substances. He has completely 
disassociated himself from all drug-using individuals and has avoided the environments 
where drugs are used.33 He has vowed to never use marijuana again.34  
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
Applicant started experimenting with alcohol by having two to four beers with 
friends with an unspecified frequency, due to peer pressure, when he was 16 years old. 
His alcohol consumption remained unremarkable until about 2002 following his first 
combat tour as a special-forces soldier. His consumption increased to a six-pack of 
beer, two to three days per week. In 2008, Applicant increased the quantity and 
frequency of his alcohol consumption to a six-pack of beer a day and a couple of mixed 
drinks for four to five days per week. At times, he would consume up to 8 to 12 drinks 
over an unspecified period. His drinking pattern remained unchanged until the winter of 
2009 after he returned from another combat deployment.35 Applicant’s pattern of alcohol 
consumption between that point and May 2011 has not been developed. 
 
When he was consuming alcohol, Applicant did so with friends and coworkers at 
parties and social gatherings. Alcohol generally made him quiet, but also led him to 
exercise poor judgment. At times, he became loud and obnoxious. Two beers might 
intoxicate him and give him slurred speech.36 It also resulted in three alcohol-related 
incidents with police authorities. 
 
In October 1999, the evening after returning home from a six-month deployment 
to Haiti, Applicant attended his infantry company party and consumed an unspecified 
quantity of alcohol. On the way home, he was stopped by the police and administered a 
field sobriety test. Being “young and stupid,” and not feeling drunk, he refused to take 
the breathalizer.37 He was charged with driving while impaired (DWI), refused chemical 
test, and 30-day civil revocation (suspension).38 He was found guilty of DWI – Level 5,

 AE Q (Driving Record, dated November 13, 2013), at 3. Under the laws of the state where the incident 
occurred, there may be a pretrial revocation of driving privileges for a driver facing an alcohol related offense. Among 
the reasons for such an action is where the driver refused to submit to an implied consent offense. Typically, upon 
being charged with an offense where a pretrial revocation occurs, the driver’s license is suspended for 30 days. 
Hence, the 30 Day Civil Revocation. Tr. at 79.

and sentenced to 60 days confinement (suspended), $186 in fines and costs, placed on 
probation for 12 months, and his operator’s license was suspended for one year.39 
 
In July 2008, after returning home from a deployment to Afghanistan, Applicant 
went to a local bar to meet some friends and consumed four to five beers over the 
course of about three hours. He departed the bar, intending to go to a friend’s 
residence, when he was stopped by the police after failing to completely stop at a stop 
sign. He was administered a field sobriety test which he purportedly passed. Once 
again, he refused to take a Breathalyzer. He was arrested for what Applicant called 
suspicion of DWI.40 The records of the charges and disposition of those charges are 
inconsistent and in dispute. The driving record from the state indicates Applicant was 
charged with DWI, refused chemical test, and 30-day civil revocation (suspension), 
while the SOR alleged failure to comply with community service as well.41 He was found 
guilty as charged by the state, and sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation, 24 
hours of community service, suspension of his operator’s license for one year, ordered 
to complete 40 hours of alcohol counseling, and fines and costs. There is no evidence 
that he was also sentenced to confinement for two months, as alleged in the SOR.42  
 
A third alcohol-related incident occurred in April 2011. Applicant and his girlfriend 
attended a wedding and he had consumed two beers during the reception. His girlfriend 
was driving them from the wedding to where they intended to spend the night. An 
unmarked police car chased a vehicle past them at a high rate of speed, and Applicant’s 
girlfriend pulled the car over to the side of the road to enable them to pass. They got out 
of the car to change drivers, and shortly after Applicant drove away, the police stopped 
him. He was administered a field sobriety test which he purportedly passed. This time, 
however, he agreed to take the Breathalyzer, but it registered a blood alcohol level of 
0.08 percent.43 He was charged with DWI and 30-day civil revocation (suspension).44 
He was found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 30-days confinement, probation for 
14 months, revocation of his operator’s license, and fines and costs.45  
 
As noted above, in May 2011, shortly after his third DWI, Applicant sought help 
and was screened for substance use disorder and enrolled in CARP. He completed a 7-
day in-patient alcohol therapy and then completed an intensive out-patient therapy 
program. In February 2012, he completed 90 hours (twice a week for nine months) of 
substance abuse disorder specific treatment at the DVA clinic. He completed exposure

therapy for PTSD (three to four days per week for 16 weeks) and the Seeking Safety 
program (three to four days per week for 16 weeks), and is currently in the trauma 
recovery program.46 There is no evidence that Applicant was ever diagnosed with 
alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. 
 
The DVA advised him to straighten up, avoid his bad relationships, and “get 
away from the drinking, the partying, the getting together on a Friday night and 
slamming beers, and telling war stories.”47 Applicant soon realized that “things started to 
make some sense.”48 So, finally recognizing the negative impact alcohol was having on 
his life, Applicant used the coping tools and skills he had learned in his various therapy 
programs, and decided to stop consuming alcohol. He completely changed his life 
related to alcohol and has a happy relationship with his girlfriend and his daughter.49 He 
stopped drinking, “pushed away from all of those old relationships, [and] severed ties 
with a lot of the work hard, play hard, community.”50 Applicant has been abstinent since 
June 2011,51 and has no desire, even on his worst day, to consume alcohol.52 
 
Having already started one company, Applicant is now putting his experiences 
into establishing a foundation to provide other veterans coping with PTSD, TBI, and the 
associated issues of alcohol consumption, the support they need to rebuild their lives. 
He hopes to provide guidance and direction to assist them to begin to heal, rather than 
having them use alcohol as a coping mechanism and enduring the shame they feel 
about getting the help they deserve.53 
 
Financial Considerations 
When Applicant was deployed, he had given his wife a power of attorney and she 
was expected to manage the family finances while he was away. Instead, she opened 
new accounts and failed to pay the incoming bills.54 As a result, some accounts became 
past due, and were placed for collection or charged off. It is unclear as to when 
Applicant’s finances initially fell into disarray, for he apparently did not learn about their

attorney, later characterized as “unauthorized” use of those powers, for years after he left the military, but there was 
no positive resolution obtained as a result of his reports to the police. See Tr. at 155-157. He offered no 
documentation to support his charges.

true status until after he had returned from his last deployment, got out of the Army, and 
commenced separation proceedings from his wife. They informally agreed that she 
would keep the residence, the car, and a boat, and decided to reside apart. There was a 
dispute over the custody of their daughter, and that dispute made the financial situation 
even worse because of her subsequent actions. After an additional period of separation, 
they returned to court and Applicant was ordered to pay his wife $1,400 per month as 
post-separation support, as well as to pay her attorney $1,725.55 His wife was ordered 
to make the monthly payments on the home mortgage ($724) on the house in which she 
continued to reside and automobile ($600) that she continued to drive.56  
Despite hiring an attorney to represent his interests pertaining to the separation 
and eventual divorce, and the court order directing that Applicant’s wife be financially 
responsible for the house and car, nothing changed. His wife refused to make the 
necessary monthly payments for the mortgage or the car, and Applicant spent over 
$28,000 on his attorney, “and at the end of the day [he] was sitting at day one, nothing 
changed.”57 His wife abandoned the home in December 2010 without notifying him.58 
Within a couple of months, foreclosure proceedings related to the house, and 
repossession proceedings related to the car, commenced.59 Applicant never received 
any collection notices, and believed they were sent to his wife.60 As a result of the final 
divorce decree, in March 2013, Applicant was ordered to pay $600 child support per 
month, effective April 1, 2013; to maintain health insurance coverage for his daughter, 
and pay two-thirds of any uncovered expenses; to pay alimony arrearages of $14,050 at 
the rate of $100 per month, commencing April 1, 2013; to pay $10,000 attorney fees at 
the rate of $100 per month, commencing April 1, 2013; and to pay his daughter’s private 
school tuition.61 Applicant had been giving his wife $300 cash and paying for his 
daughter’s healthcare, lunch, clothing, and tuition, but the Department of Social 
Services told him he could not receive credit for those partial payments, and he was 
required to pay his wife the full $600 per month.62 
On February 22, 2013, approximately three months before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant enrolled in a debt settlement plan to have the company negotiate with his 
creditors for less-than-full repayment of his debts, to furnish Applicant financial 
guidance, and to resolve his delinquent accounts.63 Three accounts were included in the

initial debt schedule, and Applicant was to make a total monthly payment of $431, 
commencing March 6, 2013.64 That effort ceased because he felt it would simply take 
too long to resolve the debts, and Applicant has not commenced making any payments 
under that plan.65 Applicant sought additional financial counseling from a variety of 
sources in order to determine his best possible options.66 He also enrolled in the 
financial readiness program at his local military facility, and was scheduled to take 
classes in personal financial management, budgeting, and debt management.67 He was 
advised by the financial readiness program specialist that, based on his current debt 
and available income, Chapter 13 bankruptcy might be his best strategy.68 He engaged 
the professional services of a bankruptcy attorney, and as soon as he completes paying 
the attorney the required $815, covering attorney fees, filing fee, and credit counseling 
class (which he already completed), he expects to file for bankruptcy and dispute one 
account.69 Applicant has contacted nearly all of his creditors, and has already paid off or 
otherwise resolved some accounts, including non-SOR accounts, or entered into 
repayment arrangements and is making scheduled payments on other accounts. He is 
disputing one account. 
In February 2013, in conjunction with his aborted debt settlement plan, Applicant 
established a personal financial summary reflecting a total income of $4,000; and 
monthly expenses of $3,523; leaving a monthly disposable income of $477.70 In March 
2013, Applicant provided a personal financial statement reflecting his current financial 
information. It depicted a monthly net income of $4,308.20; monthly household, 
transportation, food expenses, child support, and tuition payments of $1,909.96; and 
monthly debt payments of $1,675; leaving a monthly remainder of $723.24 available for 
discretionary savings or expenditures.71 Applicant’s rent and utilities are paid by his 
girlfriend.72 In January 2014, Applicant provided a revised personal financial statement 
reflecting his current financial information. It depicted a monthly net income of $3,660; 
monthly household, utility, transportation, food expenses, and child support payments of

The SOR identified nine purportedly continuing delinquencies. Among those 
accounts are the following:  
 
There is a secured loan account for a boat with a high credit of $19,731 that was 
opened in 2007, for which Applicant was paying $320 per month until sometime in 2008. 
Because of the separation and divorce activity, he was unable to continue paying on the 
account and it became delinquent. Applicant advised the bank of his situation, but 
Applicant’s wife had possession of the boat, and without Applicant’s knowledge or 
approval, she told the bank to repossess the boat.74 It was repossessed in May 2010, 
and $18,257 was charged off in June 2010. The boat was auctioned off by the bank and 
sold for $16,000 to the marina where it was being stored.75 Although Applicant had 
made some unspecified lump sum payments on the account, and contended the 
balance should be somewhere around $10,590, as of May 2012, the unpaid balance 
was listed as $16,943, and as of January 2013, that balance had increased to $17,996 
(SOR & 3.a.).76 Applicant received no credit from the bank with regard to what it 
received through the auction, and his efforts, to date, to resolve that issue have been 
unsuccessful.77 In June 2012, Applicant indicated he would resolve the account by 
January 2013.78 In June 2013, he claimed to be working on a repayment plan, but there 
is no evidence that any such plan was commenced.79 Applicant now intends to have his 
attorney dispute the account and obtain satisfaction regarding the sale of the boat. 
However, until he does so formally, and submits documentation in support of his 
dispute, the account has not been resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $6,000 and past-due balance 
of $231 that was placed for collection and, in November 2012, charged off in the 
amount of $8,212 (SOR & 2.b.).80 In August 2011, Applicant and the collection agent 
agreed to a repayment plan, and since that time, he has been making monthly 
payments of $235.81 In light of his continuing payments, the account was transferred

back to the original creditor from the collection agent. The account was also to be 
included in his initial, but cancelled, debt schedule. The account is in the process of 
being resolved. 
 
There is an automobile loan account with a credit limit of $32,493 that was 
placed for collection and, in August 2010, charged off in the amount of $18,933 (SOR & 
3.c.).82 Applicant contended it was a used car loan opened in February 2006 in the 
amount of about $8,000, and that he made monthly payments of $525 from February 
2006 until March 2008.83 The court had ordered him to pay his wife $1,400 per month 
as post-separation support, and she was ordered to make the monthly payments on the 
automobile ($600). She continued to drive the vehicle, but failed or refused to make the 
payments. The account became delinquent and Applicant was being overwhelmed with 
collection notices, so he hired a private investigator to locate the vehicle. It was in the 
possession of his wife’s new boyfriend. Applicant had the vehicle voluntarily 
repossessed and returned to the dealer.84 It was sold at auction, and the dealer initially 
wanted about $18,000, but eventually reduced the outstanding balance to $6,333.85 
Applicant contended he made a lump sum payment of $1,500 in 2010, but failed to 
submit any documentation to support his contention, and intended to resolve the 
account by January 2013.86 The account was also to be included in his initial, but 
cancelled, debt schedule, but as of December 2013, he is merely negotiating but not 
paying anything.87 The account has not been resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $3,900, a high balance of 
$4,578, and past-due balance of $1,330, that was placed for collection and, in March 
2010, charged off in the amount of $4,379 (SOR & 3.d.).88 The account was 
subsequently sold to a debt purchaser,89 and the remaining balance is listed as 
$4,381.90 The account is the same account as that alleged in SOR & 3.f. Applicant 
contended that, without his knowledge, but using his power of attorney, his wife took out 
a home equity line of credit.91 In July 2012, Applicant intended to resolve the account by 
January 2013,92 but as of December 2013, there is no evidence of any repayment plan

or payments made on the account. In June 2013, Applicant stated that the “card was 
the result of marital debt and until only recently was a judgment made on the 
responsible payer.”93 It remains unclear as to what Applicant was saying. The account 
has not been resolved. 
 
There is an unspecified type of account with a credit limit of $10,372 and past-
due $10,627 that was placed for collection in May 2011. The account was transferred or 
sold to another debt collection agent. The unpaid balance in November 2012 was 
$12,914, and by February 2013, it had increased to $13,296 (SOR & 3.e.).94 Applicant 
was unsure as to identity of the original creditor, and at one point stated it was the same 
company to which his auto loan was sold, as discussed above pertaining to (SOR & 
3.c.).95 At another point, he said it was the same account referred to in (SOR & 3.b.).96  
Applicant had never received documentation regarding the account, so he requested 
them from the creditor, only to be told it would cost $2,200 to obtain the past 
statements.97 The account was to be included in his initial, but cancelled, debt schedule. 
In June 2013, Applicant stated the account was in a repayment plan,98 and during the 
hearing he contended the balance had been reduced to about $8,000.99 In the absence 
of any documentation to confirm any aspect of Applicant’s contentions, I conclude that 
the account has not been resolved. 
There is a home mortgage account with a credit limit of $109,950, an unpaid 
balance of $97,156, and past-due balance of $26,989, for which foreclosure 
proceedings commenced in February 2013 (SOR & 3.g.).100 The court had ordered him 
to pay his wife $1,400 per month as post-separation support, and she was ordered to 
make the monthly payments on the mortgage ($724) on the house in which she 
continued to reside. His wife refused to make the necessary monthly payments for the 
mortgage and she eventually abandoned the home in December 2010 without notifying 
Applicant. Within a couple of months, foreclosure proceedings related to the house 
commenced, but Applicant never received any collection notices, and believed they 
were sent to his wife. Once he learned of the foreclosure activities, Applicant 
approached the creditor, and on February 12, 2013, they entered into a loan 
modification agreement.101 Applicant’s monthly mortgage payment is $726, and with a

renter paying him $950 per month, he has a positive balance.102 The mortgage is 
currently in good standing.103 The account has been resolved. 
Applicant initially said that at some unspecified point, he received what he 
believed was a $20,000 bonus from his state National Guard for six years of service. 
When he transferred his guard affiliation from one state to another, it was apparently 
determined that he had been overpaid.104 Another version of the same story was that he 
received a check for $5,998.105 Regardless of the amount received, Applicant spent the 
funds,106 but did not explain how he did so. In July 2012, Applicant indicated that the 
entire issue was caused by an administrative error, and that he was working on getting 
it resolved within the next several months.107 He failed to do so. In October 2012, the 
collection agent indicated the debt balance was $7,660.21, and offered Applicant 
several repayment options, among which were wage garnishment, payment in full, and 
a repayment plan.108 Applicant contended that he entered into a repayment plan about 
three months before the SOR was issued,109 and that he had been making monthly 
payments of $110 by automatic debit.110 He now contends that he has increased his 
monthly payments to $175.111 Applicant’s credit report lists the original account amount 
as $6,348,112 and reflects a number of payments.113 The balance as of February 2013, 
was $5,984 (SOR & 3.h.).114 While Applicant has failed to submit documentation 
indicating more recent payments, it appears that the account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
During the period of his separation, Applicant’s wife refused to sign his joint state 
and federal income tax returns and he was required to file as an individual. Because he 
did not have sufficient funds to make his entire payments, he had unpaid balances for

the tax years 2009 and 2011, totaling $44,086 (SOR & 3.i.).115 Applicant’s wages were 
apparently garnished, in the amount of $211 two times per month, commencing in April 
2010.116 However, with a desire to resolve the account much quicker, in January 2013, 
three months before the SOR was issued, Applicant and the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) entered into an installment agreement under which Applicant agreed to pay the 
IRS $700 each month.117 The payment is automatically deducted by the IRS from 
Applicant’s account.118 Copies of the Installment Agreement and account history 
reflecting payments were furnished to the DOD CAF in March 2013. The account is in 
the process of being resolved. 
 
Character References  
 
Applicant’s professional colleagues and friends were effusive with praise for 
Applicant’s efforts and activities. He has been described as a highly professional, 
honest, honorable, trustworthy individual who has consistently demonstrated sound 
judgment, a high degree of professionalism and security awareness, a passion for the 
people around him, and an uncommon drive for excellence. He is a grounded, straight 
shooter who always conducts himself with discretion, maturity, with empathy, and 
kindness. He is also a dedicated provider and an excellent father.119 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”120 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon 
a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”121   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief

introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”122 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government.123  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.  Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.”124 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”125 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG & 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 25(a), any drug abuse (see above definition), is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, 
under AG ¶ 25(g), any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance, may 
raise security concerns. In an effort to relieve his stress and pain, as well as to enable 
him to sleep, Applicant started to self-medicate, in part, using marijuana, to do so. 
During the relatively brief period from May 2011 until July 2011, long after he had been 
granted a security clearance, Applicant smoked one marijuana “joint” per week in an 
effort to reduce his stress, manage his pain, and enable him to sleep. Applicant’s abuse 
of marijuana never resulted in any arrests. Nor was he ever evaluated or diagnosed with 
marijuana abuse or dependence by a licensed clinical social worker or duly qualified 
medical professional. AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) have been established.  
  The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying conditions 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Under AG ¶ 26(b), 
 
18 
                                      
 
drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is a demonstrated intent 
not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. 
In addition, AG ¶ 26(d) may apply where there is satisfactory completion of a prescribed 
drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare 
requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly 
qualified medical professional. 
AG ¶¶ 26(a) and 26(b) apply, and 26(d) partially applies. Applicant’s use of 
marijuana to relieve his stress and pain associated with his PTSD and TBI, as well as to 
enable him to sleep, during the relatively brief period from May 2011 until July 2011, 
ceased well before the SOR was issued in May 2013. As of the December 2013 
hearing, he had been abstinent for over two and one-half years, and it has not recurred. 
The eventual cumulative success of his various treatment programs which addressed 
his PTSD and TBI, as well as his ancillary issues, his new understanding and outlook 
regarding PTSD and TBI, along with his continuing active and frequent participation in 
related programs, his period of sustained abstinence from marijuana, his disassociation 
from all drug-using individuals, his avoidance of the environments where drugs were 
used, and his stated intent to never use marijuana again, reflect Applicant’s substantial 
efforts to demonstrate an intention not to abuse any drugs in the future. Applicant’s drug 
abuse is unlikely to continue or recur, and no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out 
in AG ¶ 21:  
      
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of 
concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or 
alcohol dependent is potentially disqualifying. In addition, habitual or binge consumption 
 
19 
                                      
 
of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, may apply under AG ¶ 22(c).  .  
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) have been established by Applicant’s three alcohol-
related incidents involving the police and judicial authorities, and because he repeatedly 
consumed alcohol to the point of impaired judgment or intoxication. There was a point in 
his life when Applicant was, by his own description, “young and stupid.” He was charged 
with DWI on three occasions, and during two of those incidents, he refused to take a 
breathalyzer test. Police and judicial intervention proved useless until shortly after his 
most recent incident, when he finally sought assistance from the DVA and enrolled in 
CARP and associated programs. 
 
 The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from alcohol consumption. Under AG ¶ 23(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where so much time has passed, or the behavior was so 
infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. Similarly, when the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of 
alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has 
established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an 
alcohol abuser), AG ¶ 23(b) may apply. In addition, AG ¶ 23(d) may apply if: 
 
The individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
AG ¶¶ 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) apply. For a number of years, Applicant simply 
ignored his alcohol problems. He was a hard-drinking special operations combat soldier. 
Two of the alcohol-related incidents occurred shortly after he had returned from 
deployments. He consumed alcohol with friends for social reasons as well as to self-
medicate to relieve his stress and pain associated with his PTSD and TBI, as well as to 
enable him to sleep.  In May 2011, shortly after his third DWI, Applicant sought help and 
was enrolled in CARP. He completed a 7-day in-patient alcohol therapy and then 
completed an intensive out-patient therapy program. In February 2012, he completed 90 
hours (twice a week for nine months) of substance abuse disorder specific treatment at 
the DAV clinic. He completed exposure therapy for PTSD (three to four days per week 
for 16 weeks) and the Seeking Safety program (three to four days per week for 16 
weeks), and is currently in the trauma recovery program. There is no evidence that 
Applicant was ever diagnosed with alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. 
 
Applicant soon realized that “things started to make some sense.” So, finally 
recognizing the negative impact alcohol was having on his life, Applicant used the 
 
20 
                                      
 
coping tools and skills he had learned in his various therapy programs, and decided to 
stop consuming alcohol. He completely changed his life related to alcohol and has a 
happy relationship with his girlfriend and his daughter. He stopped drinking, pushed 
away from all of those old relationships, and severed ties with a lot of the work hard, 
play hard, community. Applicant has been abstinent since June 2011, and has no 
desire, even on his worst day, to consume alcohol.  
 
Applicant has been consistently candid about the significance of alcohol in his 
life. He was forthright in his estimations about the frequency and quantity of his alcohol 
consumption, and has not attempted to minimize his problem. Applicant was, at times, 
initially unwilling or unable to curtail his alcohol consumption, but now he is able to do 
so. His abstinence since June 2011 is accompanied by the abstinence from marijuana 
as well as his new conviction and intention to remain abstinent from all the substances 
with which he had problems. Applicant’s abstinence is viewed favorably, and he should 
be encouraged to continue it. Applicant has furnished substantial evidence of positive 
actions taken to overcome his alcohol problem, and has established a pattern of 
abstinence that enables me to conclude that his alcohol problem has been put behind 
him and will not recur. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In addition, under AG ¶ 19(g), failure to file annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same is potentially 
disqualifying. At about the time Applicant returned from his last deployment, got out of 
the Army, and commenced separation proceedings from his wife, Applicant’s finances 
seemed to deteriorate, or at least their delinquent status started coming to his attention. 
He was experiencing some financial difficulties over the next few years, and those 
difficulties increased to the point where he was unable to make routine monthly 
payments for a number of accounts. Accounts eventually started becoming delinquent 
and were placed for collection. He had insufficient funds to pay his income tax, and his 
wages were subsequently garnished. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply, and 19(g) partially 
applies.    
 
 
21 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.126 In addition, if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 
20(e) may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply, and AG 20(a) and 20(e) partially apply. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since about 
2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending on 
his part, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were 
largely beyond Applicant’s control. Following military protocol, Applicant gave his wife a 
power of attorney and he deployed on four occasions. She was expected to manage the 
family finances while he was away. Instead, she opened new accounts and failed to pay 
the incoming bills. Applicant was initially ordered to pay his wife $1,400 per month as 
post-separation support, as well as to pay her attorney $1,725. His wife was ordered to 
make the monthly payments on the home mortgage on the house in which she 
continued to reside and automobile that she continued to drive. She failed or refused to 
do so. She abandoned the home without notifying him, and loaned the vehicle to her 
new boyfriend. Applicant never received any collection notices. The house went into the 
foreclosure process and the vehicle was repossessed. His wife refused to sign his 
income tax returns so he could file joint returns, and he was forced to file as an 
individual.  
                                                          
126
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
22 
                                      
 
Applicant searched around for guidance. His divorce lawyer proved to be a 
disaster in failing to obtain an equitable distribution of assets and liabilities. Applicant 
and his wife are now divorced, and he no longer needs to rely on her to manage the 
family finances. In addition, she no longer has his power of attorney, and cannot open 
new accounts or ignore required monthly payments on his accounts. Applicant enrolled 
in a debt settlement plan in an effort to have the company negotiate with his creditors, 
furnish him with financial guidance, and resolve his delinquent accounts. The plan was 
aborted. He then sought financial counseling from other sources. After discussing his 
options with another attorney, it was determined that his best option is to file for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13. He is in the process of doing so. Nevertheless, Applicant 
acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts.127 He resolved various non-
SOR accounts, and entered into repayment plans with several creditors. He has been 
making his agreed monthly payments on a credit card account, his military 
overpayment, and his IRS delinquency. He was able to withdraw his mortgage from the 
foreclosure process, and after entering a loan-modification agreement, that mortgage is 
now current. There are two accounts which are the subjects of dispute, and they refer to 
the boat and the vehicle.  Applicant’s wife was ordered to make payments, but she did 
not. Both items were sold at auction, but the creditors have seemingly failed to credit 
Applicant with what they received from those sales. It is unclear if the few remaining are 
being resolved, or will be resolved under the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, for while Applicant 
had indicated certain actions taken with regard to those accounts, he also failed to 
submit documentation to support his contentions. Applicant no longer has any other 
delinquent debts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are 
under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.128 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
                                                          
127
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside 
his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines H, G, and F, in my analysis below.      
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There was a point 
in his life when he was “young and stupid.” He used marijuana while holding a security 
clearance. His involvement with alcohol led him into situations where he consumed too 
much alcohol, and found himself with three DWIs. Applicant has a history of financial 
delinquencies commencing in about 2009. He permitted accounts to become delinquent 
and placed for collection or charged off. He lost a vehicle and a boat to repossession 
and auction-sale, and nearly lost his home to foreclosure. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. A highly 
decorated combat veteran, Applicant was deployed on four occasions, including 
deployments to Haiti, Egypt, and twice to Afghanistan. He was awarded the Silver Star 
for gallantry in action during a combined joint special operation in Afghanistan, the 
Bronze Star Medal (two awards), and the Purple Heart. He is afflicted with PTSD and 
TBI. Applicant’s use of marijuana to relieve his stress and pain associated with his 
PTSD and TBI, as well as to enable him to sleep, during the relatively brief period from 
May 2011 until July 2011, ceased well before the SOR was issued in May 2013. As of 
the December 2013 hearing, he had been abstinent for both marijuana and alcohol for 
over two and one-half years, and his use of those substances has not recurred. The 
eventual cumulative success of his various treatment programs which addressed his 
PTSD and TBI, as well as his ancillary issues, his new understanding and outlook 
regarding PTSD and TBI, along with his continuing active and frequent participation in 
related programs, his period of sustained abstinence from  alcohol and marijuana, his 
disassociation from all drug-using individuals, his avoidance of the environments where 
drugs were used, and his stated intent to never use alcohol or marijuana again, reflect 
Applicant’s substantial efforts to demonstrate an intention not to abuse any alcohol or 
drugs in the future.  
 
Applicant’s financial delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of his 
wife’s actions under the authority of his power of attorney, as well as her actions of 
ignoring a court mandate and refusing to pay certain bills. Nevertheless, Applicant 
addressed the situation and attempted to resolve his delinquent accounts. He did not 
turn his back on his creditors. Instead, he has paid off or settled, or otherwise resolved 
accounts with several creditors, including his non-SOR creditors, and is currently active 
with repayment plans for several remaining creditors. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
24 
                                      
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:129 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
 I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.130 Applicant has 
demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and elimination. He has 
made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a 
warning that his failure to continue his abstinence from alcohol and drugs, or his failure 
to resolve his financial delinquencies, or the creation of new delinquent accounts, will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.131 After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the drug involvement, alcohol 
consumption, and financial conditions security concerns. See AG && 2(a)(1) - 2(a)(9). 
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and 
                                                          
129
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
130
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
131
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should 
not be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s drug and alcohol abstinence, or his 
continuing efforts to resolve his financial delinquencies, or the creation of new delinquencies. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); 
ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated and overcome the Government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
