DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 8, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security 
clearance. On April 24, 2013, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge and was reassigned to 
me on August 27, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Notice of 
 
2 
 
 
Hearing on November 22, 2013. The hearing was held as scheduled on December 18, 
2013. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and 
Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through O. Applicant’s list of exhibits was marked as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The record of the proceeding was left open until February 3, 
2014, for Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted AE P 
through T. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. Department 
Counsel’s email indicating he had no objections to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits was 
marked as HE 2. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on January 2, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old partner in a business that provides services as a 
defense contractor. He has held that position since June 2002. He earned a bachelor’s 
degree in 1986 and a master’s degree in 1998. He served on active duty in the U.S. 
Army from July 1982 to September 1996 and in the Army Reserve from September 
1996 to July 1997. He received honorable discharges for his military service. He is 
divorced and has three children, ages 17, 21, and 24. He has held a security clearance 
since 1983 without incident.1 
 
The SOR contained three Guideline F allegations. First, the SOR alleged that 
Applicant owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $75,842 in unpaid 
income taxes for 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Next, it alleged that he failed to file state income tax 
returns for 2006 through 2011 until February 15, 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Finally, it alleged 
that he owed unpaid state income taxes in the following approximate amounts: $15,659 
for 2006; $13,648 for 2007; $25,343 for 2008; $23,898 for 2009; $21,652 for 2010; and 
$15,980 for 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The total of alleged unpaid state income taxes is 
$116,180. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant neither admitted nor denied the 
allegations. He acknowledged, however, that he would pay the unpaid Federal income 
taxes in SOR ¶ 1.a and stated that he submitted a payment plan for the unpaid state 
income taxes in SOR ¶ 1.c. His Answer did not specifically address the allegation in 
SOR ¶ 1.b.2 
 
Reasons for Financial Problems 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to various causes. He described these 
causes as coming together to form the perfect storm.3

Applicant first indicated that business difficulties created some of his financial 
problems. His business difficulties included the Federal Government allegedly reneging 
on a portion of a contract in which his business served as a subcontractor. Under this 
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, Applicant’s business should have been allowed to fill a 
number of employment positions. The Government, however, refused to let Applicant’s 
business fill those positions, but instead directed that individuals who were already filling 
those positions be retained in them. As a result of not being able to fill those positions 
with its employees, Applicant’s business made far less money than originally expected 
under that contract. Due to this change in circumstances, Applicant estimated that his 
business lost as much $500,000 in the first year of the contract, $1,000,000 in the 
second year, and more in out-years.4 
 
Additionally, Applicant’s partnership encountered financial problems when the 
prime contractor on another contract began making late travel payments to his 
business. Because of those late payments, Applicant was forced to use his personal 
funds to reimburse his employees’ travel expenses and to pay other business 
expenses. For example, his business went almost the entire year of 2009 without 
receiving travel reimbursements from the prime contractor. Specifically, he indicated the 
prime contractor fell behind $75,000 in travel payments for 2009 and $40,000 in 
another. Applicant stated these late payments caused him to “hoard cash” so that he 
could continue meeting his business obligations. His business, however, would 
eventually receive the late payments.5  
 
Furthermore, the Federal Government’s sequestration of funds and its recent 
shutdown have negatively impacted Applicant’s business. In September 2012, he was 
informed that the Federal Government would lay off subcontractors due to budget 
shortfalls. Because his and his partners’ jobs were placed in jeopardy, he renegotiated a 
contract to cut his company’s labor and travel costs in order to avoid having that 
contract terminated. These funding constraints also caused his business to shut down 
for periods. In the year before the hearing, his business had 51 days of unexpected 
work outages, with the majority of those occurring in August 2013.6  
 
Applicant’s tumultuous relationship with his ex-wife also has negatively impacted 
his financial situation. They first married in 1990, then divorced, remarried in 1993, 
separated in 2000, and divorced again in 2005. In 2010, they began on-again/off-again 
periods of reconciliation that ended in January 2013. In the past, his ex-wife has 
contacted law-enforcement authorities accusing him of domestic violence and has 
instituted a number of civil actions against him. With the exception of Applicant entering 
an Alford plea to a disorderly conduct charge arising from his ex-wife’s accusations in 
November 2010, her accusations and legal actions against him have been resolved in

his favor. He attributed his ex-wife’s behavior to her epilepsy. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel conceded that Applicant’s ex-wife acted “in an irrational manner 
over the years . . . .” Nevertheless, her institution of legal actions against him has 
caused him to expend money on legal fees.7 
 
Applicant described his divorce decree as “unconscionable.” Under that divorce 
decree, he was required each month to pay $2,500 in alimony and $2,300 in child 
support. He was also required to maintain life insurance on himself and medical 
insurance on his children. He indicated that his ex-wife took medications for her 
epilepsy before they were pulled off the market that may have caused her to suffer 
personality disorders. His ex-wife was required to obtain health insurance, while he was 
required to pay for her health insurance. He was further required to pay any medical 
expenses not covered by her insurance. Additionally, he was obligated to pay his 
children’s college expenses and to provide each of them a car and spending money. As 
he was paying their college expenses, he was still paying his ex-wife child support, 
which she pocketed. He calculated that he paid $681,400 in alimony and child support 
payments from January 2005 to August 2013. In January 2013, he was awarded 
custody of his remaining minor child, his child support payments were suspended, his 
alimony payments were reduced to $1,300, and his ex-wife had a restraining order 
issued against her.8    
 
 Applicant testified that his ex-wife never obtained health insurance. He indicated 
that she applied for health insurance, but was apparently unable to obtain it due to her 
pre-existing conditions. He also stated that she refused to sign up for a Pre-Existing 
Condition Insurance Plan when she became eligible. Consequently, he paid her medical 
expenses over the years. He produced a document estimating he paid $21,585 in 2011, 
$32,316 in 2012, and $12,159 in 2013 for her medical expenses. He described those 
figures as conservative estimates and stated that he probably paid more than the 
indicated amounts. He stated that his ex-wife was now applying for medical insurance 
under the Affordable Care Act.9  
 
Applicant’s business partner testified that Applicant’s ex-wife would do whatever 
she could to cause him to spend money. For example, the partner discussed an incident 
when she was not feeling well and Applicant urged her to go to the doctor’s office. She 
instead called an ambulance and went to the emergency room, which resulted in more 
expensive bills for him to pay. The partner also indicated that Applicant’s ex-wife would 
intentionally fail to take her epilepsy medication so that she would have seizures.10

 Applicant also provided his elderly parents with financial assistance. In 2006, his 
father was diagnosed with dementia that progressed rapidly, while his mother suffered 
from high blood pressure and diabetes for decades. He started sending them a couple 
hundred dollars a month in late 2006, but those monthly payments eventually ballooned 
to $1,250. Those payments stopped in late 2011 when his parents became eligible for 
state assistance, and his father was placed into a nursing home.11 
 
Federal and State Income Tax Issues 
 
Applicant has been the principle partner in his business since 2002. Each year 
he filed partnership tax returns with the IRS and the state as required. Because his 
partnership was a pass-through entity for tax purposes, his partnership’s profits were 
not subject to business taxes, but instead were treated as personal income and taxed 
accordingly.12 
 
In his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) dated June 
6, 2012, Applicant disclosed that he did not file state income tax returns from 2006 to 
2010 and estimated that he owed $75,000 to the state in back taxes. He further stated: 
 
I have prepared all of the necessary returns and saved the funds to pay 
the back taxes. I am hiring an accountant to file the returns and work with 
the state to resolve the issue. An upturn in my business has resulted in a 
substantial increase in income to preclude the problem from recurring. 
Additionally, my ex-spouse has applied for health insurance under the 
Pre-Existing Condition Health Insurance program which will help 
significantly reduce medical costs.  
 
The e-QIP also asked whether there were any other instances in the past seven years 
in which he failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required. He 
responded “No” to that latter question and did not disclose, as noted below, that he 
failed to file a number of Federal income tax returns as required or that he had a state 
tax lien filed against him in November 2011. During his Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) interview in August 2012, he reportedly stated that he did not list 
the state tax lien on his e-QIP due to an oversight and that he contacted his state taxing 
authority in July 2012 to inform them that he would pay in full his 2006 to 2010 state 
income taxes in September 2012.13

13 Tr. at 63, 110-112; GE 1, 2, 3, 5; AE K.  Applicant’s state requires calendar-year taxpayers to 
file their state income tax returns on or before April 15 (which may vary if it falls on a weekend) of the 
following year. Fiscal-year taxpayers must file on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the close 
of their taxable year. During his OPM interview, Applicant stated that he became aware of the state tax 
lien when he obtained his credit report in June 2012 before submitting his e-QIP. It should be noted that 
conduct not alleged in the SOR will not be considering in applying the disqualifying conditions, but “may 
be considered (a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of

On January 26, 2013, Applicant received DOD’s second set of interrogatories 
that requested information about his income taxes. He testified that he never received 
the first set of interrogatories. After receiving the second set of interrogatories, Applicant 
consulted with an accountant to check his income tax returns. At the hearing, he 
indicated that he consulted with the accountant at that time because his financial issues 
had seemed to stabilize.14 
 
 In responding to those interrogatories on February 22, 2013, Applicant provided 
his Federal and state income tax returns for 2006 through 2011. His state income tax 
returns for 2006 and 2008 through 2011 were dated February 15, 2013; his state 
income tax return for 2007 was not dated. His Federal income tax returns were not 
dated. Information in the following table was derived from IRS Account Transcripts and 
Applicant’s Federal and state income tax returns.

Each tax year, Applicant was granted an extension for filing his Federal income 
tax returns so that he was required to file each return on October 15th of the following 
calendar year. Line 5a on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions) of Form 1040 falls under 
the category of “Taxes You Paid” and provides for the reporting of state and local taxes 
actually paid, including state income taxes withheld during the tax year, those paid in 
the tax year for a prior tax year, or those paid in the tax year by estimated payments.17 
   
From 2006 to 2011, Applicant neither had state income taxes withheld from his 
pay nor made periodic estimated tax payments to the state. He testified that, when he 
prepared his Federal income tax return each year, he also prepared his state income 
tax return for that year, but did not file the state return at that time. Before filing the state 
income tax returns, he had planned to hire an accountant to review them because of the 
back tax issues. Upon questioning at the hearing about why he was reporting on his 
Federal income tax returns that he had paid state income tax when he had not made 
those payments, Applicant initially testified that he checked with an accountant who told 
him that reporting his state income taxes in that manner “was true as long as you 
eventually filed it and paid it, even if you haven’t paid it yet.” When questioned about his 
earlier statement that the accountant reviewed the state income tax returns before he 
filed them in February 2013, Applicant then indicated that he prepared the tax returns 
using tax software and stated, “And as far as checking with the accountant, the 
accountant reviewed all of these this year and he didn’t have -- he didn’t have any 
problem with that.”18 
 
In his testimony, Applicant indicated that he had saved the money to pay the 
back state taxes as he had reported on his e-QIP. He testified, however, that funding 
concerns arose again because of prime contractor late payments in July 2012, which 
caused him to hold off on filing the state income tax returns or paying the back taxes. 
He stated that he believed, if he filed his state income tax returns on time, the state 
would have immediately come back and demanded payment of those taxes putting him 
at risk of not being able to make payments to his ex-wife or continue making payments 
to keep his business running.19 
 
                                                          
17 Tr. 133-134; GE 2. See e.g. http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p17--2009.pdf for information on 
Federal income tax filing deadlines. See e.g. IRS 2009 Instructions Schedule A (Form 1040), which may 
be found at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040sca--2009.pdf for instruction on reporting state and local 
taxes. See also, IRS Publication 17 for information on reporting of state and local taxes.  
18 Tr. at 111-119, 133-142; AE Q.   At the hearing, the issue arose about whether Applicant was 
accurately reporting the amount of his state income taxes on Federal income tax returns, because those 
amounts did not match the amounts reported on the state income tax return for the same year. The above 
table, however, reflects that he reported his state income taxes for a particular year on his following year’s 
Federal income tax return. Given that he had no state income taxes withheld from his pay and did not 
make any estimated tax payments during the tax year, this system of reporting his state income taxes 
would have been proper if he actually paid the reported taxes in those years.

 Applicant’s Federal income tax return for 2011 reflected that he owed $75,482 in 
taxes. His IRS Account Transcript for Tax Year 2011 dated February 11, 2013, reflected 
that he had not paid any income taxes for that tax year. In his post-hearing submission, 
Applicant provided processed checks showing he paid $50,000 on April 25, 2013, and 
$51,600 on February 2, 2014, to the U.S. Treasury for his 2011 past-due income taxes. 
He testified that work outages at his business held up the payment of those past-due 
taxes.20 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant provided an Installment Payment Plan dated May 13, 
2013, from his state in which he agreed to pay his past-due state income taxes. Under 
that plan, he will pay $4,731 per month for 36 months. The plan reflected that he owed a 
balance of $153,619, which most likely included past-due taxes, interest, and penalties. 
Interest and penalties will continue to accrue while he is making payments under that 
plan. The payments are automatically withdrawn from his bank account. Applicant 
provided a bank statement that reflected he has made the $4,731 payments each 
month from May 2013 to January 2014.21 
 
Other Financial Matters 
 
 Following his divorce, Applicant obtained a $920,000 construction-to-permanent 
loan to build a 4,400 square foot single-family home in 2006. After construction of the 
home in 2007, the loan converted into a 30-year conventional mortgage. His monthly 
payment on that mortgage is $6,477. At the time of the hearing, Applicant owed about 
$830,000 on that mortgage. Before obtaining that loan, he sought the assistance of a 
professional mortgage broker to determine whether he could afford to build the home. In 
2007, he also obtained a $150,000 line-of-credit loan on which he is making monthly 
payments of $648.22 
 
During the OPM interview, Applicant indicated that he has never sought financial 
counseling. He provided a credit report from August 2013 that showed his only 
delinquent debt was a state tax lien of $33,498 filed in November 2011. The lien was 
filed against one of his former residences. He stated that it has been almost 10 years 
since he has had a late payment on any bill other than his taxes. He also indicated that 
he never missed any alimony or child support payments and retired $250,000 of tax 
debt between December 2012 and September 2013. He further claimed that he has not 
attempted to reduce the interest and penalties arising from his past-due taxes, even 
though taxing authorities suggested he do so.23

Character Evidence 
 
During his military service, Applicant was awarded six Army Commendation 
Medals, an Overseas Service Ribbon, a Parachutist Badge, and an Air Assault Badge.24 
 
Credibility Assessment 
 
 Record evidence raises concerns about Applicant’s credibility. This evidence 
includes:  
 
 a. Applicant reported on his 2007 through 2011 Federal income tax returns that 
he paid state income taxes in each of those years. Despite what an accountant may 
have told him, Applicant knew that he had not paid state income taxes when he filed 
those Federal income tax returns and reported untrue information. The Federal tax 
implications of inaccurately reporting that he paid $72,661 in state income taxes over 
that five-year period are unknown, but presumably decreased his Federal tax liability. It 
is also unknown whether the IRS currently knows he did not pay those state income 
taxes as reported. 
 
 b. When he submitted his e-QIP in June 2012, Applicant did not disclose that he 
had failed to file his 2006 through 2009 Federal income tax returns before the required 
deadlines or that he had not yet filed his 2010 Federal income tax return. He also failed 
to report that a state tax lien was filed against him in November 2011.  
 
 c. In his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he had prepared the past-due state income 
returns and had saved the funds to pay the back taxes. He indicated that he was hiring 
an accountant to file the returns and would work with the state to resolve this issue. By 
those statements, he created the impression that his state income tax issues would 
soon be resolved. In his OPM interview of August 2012, he stated he had contacted the 
state taxing authorities in July 2012 to inform them that he would file and pay in full his 
2006 through 2010 state income taxes in September 2012. When he responded to the 
interrogatories in February 2013, he had just filed his state returns and still had not paid 
the back taxes. In that response, he claimed he did not pay the state income taxes in 
September 2012 because of Federal Government cutbacks impacting his business. He 
further indicated that he was “fully committed to correcting his tax situation in months, 
not years.” In AE A dated August 12, 2013, he stated that his past-due Federal income 
taxes would be paid by September 13, 2013, but those taxes were not fully paid until 
January 27, 2014. By the time he submitted his post-hearing matters, which was almost 
a year after he submitted his response to the interrogatories, the majority of his past-
due state income taxes remain unpaid.

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
 
11 
 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline lists several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG 
¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Applicant paid his 2011 Federal income taxes more than two years after they 
were due. He failed to file his 2006 through 2011 state income tax returns as required or 
pay those state income taxes when they were due. The majority of his state income tax 
liability for 2006 through 2011 remains unpaid. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.   
 
  Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
12 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant experienced a number of financial setbacks. His business was 
negatively impacted by Federal Government’s funding constraints and cutbacks. His 
separation and divorce from his ex-wife have strained him financially. He also assisted 
his aging parents until they qualified for state assistance. Each of those events was a 
condition beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems. Additionally, he 
has filed his past-due state income tax returns and paid his past-due Federal income 
taxes.25 He entered into an installment plan to pay his past-due state income taxes and 
has been making regular payments under that plan. All of that evidence tends to 
mitigate the security concerns. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) partially apply.  
 
 Although Applicant paid his past-due Federal income taxes and filed his past-
due state income tax returns, security concerns arising from those allegations remain. In 
this regard, Applicant’s tax issues must be considered as a whole and not be analyzed 
in a piecemeal fashion. None of the SOR allegations are mitigated when his tax 
problems are viewed in their entirety. Additionally, Applicant’s false reporting of the 
payment of state income taxes on his Federal income tax returns, his omission of 
required information from his e-QIP, and his unfulfilled representations about when he 
would resolve his income tax issues have caused me to give his testimony less weight.  
 
 Applicant filed his 2006 through 2011 state income tax returns on February 15, 
2013. This resulted in his 2006 state income tax return being filed almost five and half 
years late. His filing of those returns did not occur until after he received DOD’s second 
set of interrogatories. The evidence further shows that he filed his 2006 through 2011 
Federal income tax returns late; four were filed about a year late.  
 
 In the past, the Appeal Board has stated: 
 
. . . Applicant's failure to file federal and state income tax returns reflect 
both an overall pattern of Applicant failing to live up to his lawful 
obligations as a citizen, and his selective compliance with laws. Such a 
                                                          
25 Applicant may still owe Federal income taxes because he did not report his payment of state 
income taxes accurately on his Federal income tax returns for 2007 through 2011.   
 
13 
 
 
pattern has negative security implications because the industrial security 
program relies heavily on the full and voluntary compliance of applicants 
with security regulations, practices and procedures. Persons who are 
unwilling or unable to fulfill all their lawful obligations in a conscientious 
manner do not inspire trust and confidence in their willingness or ability to 
properly handle and safeguard classified information.26    
 
Likewise here, Applicant’s delinquency in filing his income tax returns reflects a 
longstanding pattern of not complying with his legal obligations. While conditions 
beyond his control may have excused a short-term failure to file or pay his taxes in a 
timely manner, they do not provide mitigation for a continuing disregard of the law over 
a period of six years.  
 
Applicant’s tax problems went on far too long and were far too extensive to be 
view as an aberration or a minor problem. His tax problems were not isolated, short-
term events, but were sustained over a period of years. This conduct is recent and 
continues to impugn his trustworthiness and good judgment. 
  
 Applicant’s state tax liability, while being resolved, remains outstanding. Based 
on the evidence presented, he has failed to show that similar tax problems are unlikely 
to recur. Of note, he did not provide evidence to show that his 2012 Federal and state 
income taxes were filed and paid as required. It is still too soon to safely discount or 
dismiss the security concerns raised in this case. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
                                                          
26 ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 4-6 (App. Bd. Jul .3 1996). 
 
 
14 
 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has served in the military and has operated a successful business for a 
number of years. A court has awarded him custody of his minor child. He is a 
responsible parent and has diligently paid his alimony and child support obligations. 
Besides his past-due taxes, he has no other delinquent debts. Nonetheless, his recent 
efforts to mitigate the alleged security concerns have fallen short of establishing that he 
has reformed himself and will comply with income tax return filing and payment 
requirements in the future.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Therefore, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
   Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:  Against Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
