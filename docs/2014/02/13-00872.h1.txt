MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
While self-employed as a carpenter, Applicant did not file or pay quarterly estimates 
of his income tax obligations, federal or state, for tax years 2004 through the first quarter of 
2007. When he filed annual returns with his spouse, he could not afford to pay the taxes 
owed. Around $83,636 in federal and state tax liens were still outstanding as of 2013. In 
August 2013, he began repaying the IRS at $1,480 a month, but it is too soon to conclude 
that the financial security concerns are mitigated. Clearance denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On August 22, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
 
2 
 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on September 13, 2013. On September 
20, 2013, he requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On November 14, 2013, the case was assigned to me to 
conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for him. On November 26, 2013, I scheduled a 
hearing for December 16, 2013. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel appeared by video 
teleconference and Applicant appeared in person. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) 
were admitted into evidence and 19 Applicant exhibits (AEs A-S) were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) 
received on December 23, 2013. The SOR was amended without objection to reflect that 
the liens alleged in SOR 1.d and 1.g-1.k were federal tax liens and not state tax liens. 
 
At Applicant’s request, I held the record open after the hearing for additional 
documents. On January 5, 2014, Applicant submitted 16 potential exhibits, which were 
marked on receipt as AE T-MM. Department Counsel filed no objection to their admission 
by the January 17, 2014 deadline for comment, so the documents were accepted as full 
exhibits. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of August 22, 2013, Applicant 
owed a $3,317 judgment from March 2007 (SOR 1.a); $83,636 in income tax liens 
($67,516 federal and $16,120 state) filed between September 2005 and February 2012 
(SOR 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.m); and a medical debt of $810 (SOR 1.e). In addition, Applicant 
had failed to pay federal and state taxes for at least tax years 2004 through 2007 and 2011 
(SOR 1.n). Applicant admitted all the debts except the judgment in SOR 1.a. He explained 
that payment arrangements had been made for all the debts. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant’s admissions to the delinquent tax and medical debts are accepted and 
incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I 
make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old field installer for a defense contractor. He began working 
for the company in mid-November 2010 on their commercial projects, after being 
unemployed for over two years. Applicant seeks a DOD Secret clearance so that he will no 
longer need an escort to work in secured areas on federal projects. (GE 1; AE A.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse have been married since January 1985. They bought their 
home around July 1997. They have two sons and two daughters, who are now ages 28, 
3 
 
27, 25, and 22. (GE 1.) As of December 2013, their 27-year-old son was living at home 
after his recent discharge from the U.S. military. They are not currently asking him for 
financial support. (Tr. 51.) 
 
Applicant had his own carpentry business out of his home from April 1994 to April 
2007. Along with his son and another employee of his company, he framed houses as a 
subcontractor for a residential builder. (GE 1; AE L.) He cared for his parents financially, 
including paying between $7,000 and $9,000 each for their funerals. (Tr. 49.) After his 
father’s death in 1999, he provided around $1,000 a month to his mother for her utility bills 
and groceries until she passed away in 2006. (Tr. 43-44, 49-50.) 
 
For tax years 2004 through 2007, Applicant earned about $50,000 annually from his 
home-based carpentry business. (Tr. 46-47.) Around March 2007, a creditor of his 
business was awarded a $3,316 default judgment against Applicant (SOR 1.a). (GE 4.) 
Applicant did not show in court because he had paid the debt before the judgment. His 
payment was apparently not properly recorded. (AE R; Tr. 57-58.) 
 
Applicant did not estimate or pay income taxes quarterly to the IRS or his state for 
2004 through 2007. He was “young and dumb, thinking [he] would have that money next 
week, but it didn’t happen.” (Tr. 60.) When he and his spouse submitted their joint tax 
returns for at least those years, they did not have the funds to cover their federal and state 
tax liabilities.
1
 (GE 1.) State tax liens of $964 (SOR 1.e) and of $1,819 (not alleged in SOR) 
were filed against Applicant in September 2005 and November 2005. The latter lien was 
released the same month it was filed. (GE 3.) 
 
Due to a downturn in contracts in the slow economy, Applicant in April 2007 began 
working for another building contractor at an hourly wage of $25. He managed to secure 
work at the company for his son and their other employee as well. (AE L.) In April 2007, the 
IRS filed a $6,174 tax lien (not alleged in SOR) against Applicant. After the IRS attached 
almost all of his and his spouse’s bank deposits, they began to pay the IRS $100 a month. 
(Tr. 654-65.) Before the $6,174 lien was released in August 2008 (GE 3), the IRS filed two 
tax liens against them, of $16,523 (SOR 1.j) and $551 (SOR 1.f) in October 2007. In 
December 2007, the IRS filed a $19,065 lien (SOR 1.k). In January 2008, the IRS filed 
three tax liens against them, of $24,589 (SOR 1.g), $4,746 (SOR 1.h), and $151 (SOR 1.i). 
In September 2008, Applicant lost his job when his employer ceased operations. (Tr. 46.) 
 
 Applicant was unemployed for over two years. He was paid unemployment 
compensation around $500 a week (Tr. 47) and could not afford to make any payments 
toward his delinquent federal or state taxes. In February 2009, the IRS filed a lien of 
$2,442 against Applicant and his spouse (SOR 1.d). 
 
                                                 
1 
Applicant listed on his September 2012 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) that 
he did not file quarterly estimates of his income while self-employed from 2004 through 2007 and in 2011, and 
that he owed taxes for those years. However, with respect to 2011, he was already working for his current 
employer. When asked at his hearing whether 2004 through 2007 were the years for which he still owed taxes, 
Applicant responded that he did not know. (Tr. 52.) 
4 
 
 In November 2010, he began working for his current employer. (GE 1.) Applicant 
earned about $50,000 in annual wages his first year in his current job. Since then, he has 
averaged around $60,000 annually because of overtime earnings. (Tr. 48.) Applicant and 
his spouse had fallen behind on some credit card accounts starting around 2006, and they 
gave priority to those debts and other living expenses when Applicant resumed 
employment. (Tr. 54, 67.) Old tax liens went unpaid, and new liens continued to be filed 
against Applicant and his spouse. In July 2011, the state filed a $4,015 tax lien (SOR 1.m). 
In December 2011, the state filed a $3,041 tax lien (SOR 1.c). In February 2012, the IRS 
filed a $7,513 tax lien (SOR 1.b). 
 
 On September 30, 2012, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for DOD security clearance 
eligibility. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant admitted that he had failed 
to pay federal and state taxes within the last seven years. Based on tax liens and very 
recent statements of accounts, he indicated that he owed the IRS estimated business and 
personal taxes of $18,534 for 2004, $27,456 for 2005, $22,154 for 2006, and $1,906 for 
2007. He also reported a state tax debt around $14,605 for unknown tax years based on a 
tax lien filed in 2011. Applicant explained his federal tax delinquency as follows: 
 
I was on a payment arrangement and when I lost my job in 2007 there was 
not enough money coming into the household to maintain the utilities and 
provide food so the IRS agent my wife is working with suspended the 
payment arrangement until a time when I can maintain my household and set 
up an appropriate payment arrangement. There is a current tax lien on the 
property. Now that I am getting back on my feet we are going to get back on 
a repayment arrangement. (GE 1.) 
 
 As of October 23, 2012, Applicant had 13 tax liens on his record. Eleven of them 
totaling $83,636 had not been released. A judgment of $3,316 from January 2007 was 
listed several times with its status reported as “unknown.” Applicant owed an aggregate 
$1,405 on three credit card accounts, rated as current, and $810 in medical debt in 
collection since February 2011 (SOR 1.e). A credit card debt of $1,400, on an account on 
which he was an authorized user, was paid after collection. Applicant had been late on 
some other accounts in the past, which had zero balances. (GE 4.) 
 
 On November 13, 2012, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), partially about his tax debts and other 
financial issues. Applicant indicated that he had paid the creditor awarded the judgment in 
SOR 1.a before the case went to court. Applicant explained that the $14,605 state tax lien 
was the sum of three state tax liens (SOR 1.b, 1.c, and 1.m). Applicant denied knowing 
about the two tax liens, of $1,819 and $6,174, which had been released, or about two 
smaller state liens of $964 (SOR 1.l) and $551 (SOR 1.f). Applicant acknowledged the 
federal tax liens of $2,442 (SOR 1.d), $24,589 (SOR 1.g), $4,746 (SOR 1.h), $16,523 
(SOR 1.j), and $19,065 (SOR 1.k). Applicant did not recognize the $151 federal tax debt 
(SOR 1.i) or the medical debt in collection (SOR 1.e). He added that he and his spouse 
had been contacted by the IRS about arranging to repay $18,534 for 2004, $27,456 for 
5 
 
2005, $22,154 for 2006, and $1,096 for 2007. The IRS agreed to defer establishing a 
repayment plan until Applicant and his spouse’s financial situation became stable enough 
to address their federal tax debts. They had heard nothing from the state about their late 
taxes. His spouse, who handled the family’s finances because of his travel schedule, would 
be contacting the state to establish a payment schedule. Applicant indicated that no one 
would question his ability to live within his means or his willingness to pay his debts. 
However, Applicant admitted to the investigator that his ability to repay his debts can be 
questioned because of his substantial tax liabilities. (GE 2.)  
 
 As of July 5, 2013, Equifax was reporting four unpaid tax liens, totaling $17,047, on 
Applicant’s credit record (SOR 1.b-1.d and 1.m). No progress was reported regarding the 
resolution of the $3,317 judgment (SOR 1.a) or the $810 medical debt in collection (SOR 
1.e). (GE 3.) On July 24, 2013, after he received DOD interrogatories about the status of 
his past-due debts, Applicant and his spouse authorized the IRS to electronically debit their 
checking account. They had arranged with the IRS to pay $1,480 per month. (GE 2.) From 
August 30, 2013 through December 30, 2013, the IRS debited $7,400 from Applicant and 
his spouse’s bank account and applied the funds to their federal tax debt for 2004. (AE Q; 
LL.) 
 
 Applicant’s account with the creditor awarded the judgment in SOR 1.a was “in good 
standing with no balance” as of July 24, 2013. (GE 2; AE R.) On July 26, 2013, Applicant 
and his spouse made the first of $101.25 monthly payments toward the medical debt in 
SOR 1.e, to continue until the debt is satisfied in full. (GE 2; AE S.) As of mid-November 
2013, Applicant’s spouse had made five $101.25 payments. (AE S.) With the federal tax 
payments of $1,480, estimated state tax payments around $500, and $101.25 toward the 
medical debt, Applicant calculated his disposable monthly household income at $704.90 
before miscellaneous expenses. (GE 2.) 
 
 On July 30, 2013, Applicant’s spouse proposed to the state $500 monthly payments 
toward the delinquent state taxes. (AE JJ.) On September 12, 2013, the state department 
of revenue notified Applicant and his spouse that they owed taxes of $2,908.72 for 2004, 
$3,729.58 for 2005, $4,023.53 for 2006, and $242.90 for 2007. On January 2, 2014, 
Applicant’s spouse again requested that the state agree to accept payments for the back 
taxes. (AE II.) On January 3, 2014, the state asked for a financial statement before a 
payment plan could be approved. (AE KK.) On January 5, 2014, Applicant and his spouse 
paid off their $242 state tax debt for 2007. (AE MM.)  
 
 Applicant’s take-home pay averages $1,400 weekly, although it fluctuates 
depending on overtime and the nature of the work. Prevailing wage jobs and government 
contract work are paid at higher rates. (Tr. 69, 73.) He estimates his monthly disposable 
income at $1,000 after the federal tax payment. (Tr. 78.) The ending balance of Applicant 
and his spouse’s checking account was $1,853 as of October 2013 (AE Z), $908 as of 
November 2013 (AE AA), and $1,094 as of December 2013. (AE BB.)  
 
 Applicant’s spouse of 29 years has worked part-time at a hardware store over the 
last seven years, earning less than $10,000 annually. She had no medical insurance in 
6 
 
July 2010, when she was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Applicant and his 
spouse incurred medical costs for her surgery while he was unemployed. (AE L.) Applicant 
does not recall the amount, and he was not willing to speculate. (Tr. 50-51, 53.) Applicant’s 
spouse continued to have medical issues. At the end of 2012, she was out of work for two 
or three months. She returned to work part-time and brought into the household only about 
$330 every two weeks. As of December 2013, Applicant’s spouse was hoping to collect 
worker’s compensation following tendon surgery in mid-November 2013. (AEs V, W; Tr. 
62-63.) 
 
Character References 
 
 Applicant’s work as a field installer requires 85% travel away from the office. He is 
often the face of the company with their customers. He excelled in managing the various 
skills required of his position (construction installation, paperwork, customer interaction) to 
where a project manager gave him the opportunity to work on federal projects, most of 
which required a minimum of a DOD Secret clearance. The company has had to 
coordinate and contract with a third party to escort Applicant in secured areas. Applicant’s 
supervisor recommends him for security clearance eligibility (AE A.) 
 
  A material supply manager, to whom Applicant reported for two years, considers 
Applicant to be a valuable resource. Applicant has been extremely reliable, conscientious 
in following through with his projects, and receptive to learning new responsibilities 
promptly. (AE B.) An inspector at work, who was a classmate of one of Applicant’s sons, 
has spent a fair amount of time with Applicant. Applicant pays attention to detail and is a 
hard worker. (AE C.) 
 
 Friends and neighbors also hold favorable opinions of Applicant’s judgment, 
trustworthiness, and leadership. (AEs D, F-I, O.) Applicant has served as a board member 
in a local bowling association. Together with the league treasurer/secretary, Applicant 
controlled and dispensed league funds and organized bowling leagues and tournaments. 
(AEs D, I.) 
 
 Applicant’s younger son served as an intelligence analyst in the United States 
military before his recent discharge. He is aware that Applicant worked on jobsites with 
restricted access. Applicant advised his son that he did not ask escorts for any details 
about activities that did not affect him or his job. Applicant never tried to obtain classified or 
sensitive information from his son. Applicant’s son “wholeheartedly believe[s] that [his] 
father would sooner die than betray his family or his country.” (AE E.) 
 
 Applicant has a son-in-law who is a combat veteran. Applicant has shown him no 
reason to distrust him. He believes Applicant would never compromise the security of his 
family or the country. (AE Y.) Applicant’s other son-in-law, who is married to Applicant’s 
younger daughter, owns his own framing company, after having started in the business as 
an employee of Applicant’s seven years ago. (AE J.) Applicant is known among his 
immediate family members to possess great integrity; to be extremely hard working; always 
willing to help someone needing a hand, often without being asked; and dedicated to his 
7 
 
family and his country. (AEs J-N, X.) Applicant took a young woman into their home when 
she needed a place to stay, despite not knowing her very well. (AEs L, O.) A mother herself 
now, she looks up to Applicant as if he were her own father. (AE O.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F articulates several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG ¶ 
19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” are implicated by Applicant’s record of income tax delinquency, as 
alleged in SOR 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.m, and by the $810 medical debt in collection since 
February 2011 (SOR 1.e). Between April 2007 and February 2012, the IRS filed nine tax 
liens against Applicant totaling $81,754. Only one federal tax lien, of $6,174, has been 
released. In 2005, the state filed two tax liens against Applicant, of $964 and of $1,819 (not 
alleged). The $1,819 lien was reportedly released shortly after it was issued. In 2011, the 
state filed tax liens of $4,051 and $3,041. Available credit record information indicates 
$83,636 in outstanding federal and state tax lien debt. Based on statements and lien 
notices he had received as of September 30, 2012, Applicant estimated his tax 
delinquency at $83,845 ($69,240 federal and $14,605 state). A notice from the state dated 
September 12, 2013, shows Applicant’s state tax debt totals $10,904.73 for 2004 through 
2007. (AE MM.) The lien evidence, state tax record, and Applicant’s admissions establish 
the tax delinquency. They also establish the failure to pay his federal and state taxes for 
2004 through 2007, as partially alleged in SOR 1.n. The failure to pay taxes for those years 
does not provide a separate basis for disqualification under SOR 1.n, however, because 
the tax debts are covered by the liens. The Government did not prove that Applicant failed 
to pay his taxes for 2011 as also alleged in SOR 1.n. The state could have filed tax liens in 
2011 for taxes owed from previous tax years. 
 
Applicant disputes the judgment debt (SOR 1.a) on the basis that it was paid. 
Equifax Information Services continued to report the judgment as recently as July 2013 
with no indication that it has been paid. (GE 3.) The judgment creditor conversely indicates 
that as of July 24, 2013, Applicant’s account was in good standing with no balance owed. 
(GE 3.)  The creditor did not indicate when the debt was paid, but it tends to disprove that 
Applicant still owed the judgment as of the issuance of the SOR in August 2013. 
 
 Based on the federal tax lien information and the state tax record, Applicant’s tax 
delinquency accrued to around $86,000. It is unclear whether any of the federal debt was 
for years other than 2004 through 2007, or whether some of the federal tax liens cover the 
same tax years. Even if the debt was incurred “so long ago” in that the taxes were last due 
over five years ago, mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, 
9 
 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment,” cannot reasonably apply when most of the debt remains unresolved. Only a 
$242 state tax delinquency from tax year 2007 has been fully satisfied, and with respect to 
that debt, it is unclear whether it was included in the 2011 state tax liens in SOR 1.c and 
1.m. Applicant’s payments of $1,480 per month to the IRS since late August 2013 have 
been applied to his federal tax debt for 2004, which was about $18,534 as of late 
September 2011, so he still owes a substantial balance for that year.  
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem 
were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” is partially implicated. Medical debt is usually 
not discretionary. The $810 debt was incurred in October 2010, when he was unemployed. 
Applicant went to work shortly thereafter, and his spouse handled the finances. He did not 
know about the debt. Applicant’s tax debt was within his control. It is attributable to his 
failure to pay estimated taxes quarterly when he was self-employed between 2004 and 
2007. When he filed his tax return for that year, he did not have the funds to pay his taxes. 
The slowdown in residential building had an impact on his carpentry business by 2007, but 
AG ¶ 20(b) does not fully mitigate his failure to set aside some funds to cover his tax 
obligations. AG ¶ 20(b) mitigates some of the delay in addressing his tax delinquencies. 
Applicant was laid off from his job with a building contractor in September 2008, and he 
was unemployed until November 2010. Applicant understandably gave priority to his 
family’s living expenses when he was unemployed. However, even allowing for some time 
for Applicant to address some past-due consumer credit accounts that had fallen 
delinquent when he was out of work, he knew as of his September 2012 e-QIP that he 
owed more than $83,000 in delinquent federal and state taxes. It is difficult to find that 
Applicant handled his tax matters responsibly when there is no evidence of any contacts 
with the IRS or the state before July 2013. Applicant’s spouse had some medical issues 
that kept her out of work, but it would not have prevented Applicant or his spouse from 
contacting the IRS to resume their former payments or make new repayment arrangements 
in the 18 months before July 2013.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” both address efforts to resolve financial issues of security 
concern. After the IRS attached their bank account around 2007, Applicant and his spouse 
paid the IRS $100 a month until he lost his job in September 2008. In November 2010, he 
began working at his present job at an annual income of $50,000. Applicant’s monthly 
payments of $101.25 toward the medical debt since late July 2013, and of $1,480 to the 
IRS since August 2013, show some good faith toward his creditors, even if they were very 
belated and prompted by the DOD interrogatories. Applicant is not required to pay off each 
of his delinquent balances before he can be granted security clearance eligibility. It is 
enough that he have a credible plan in place and that he has taken significant steps to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).

Applicant has made enough payments toward the medical debt to eliminate the concerns 
about that collection account. On the other hand, five $1,480 payments to the IRS and one 
$242 payment to the state are not enough to adequately mitigate the security concerns  
under AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d) raised by tax delinquency around $78,842 as of January 
2014. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies to the judgment debt in SOR 1.a. The judgment was shown to no longer be a valid 
debt as of the issuance of the SOR in August 2013. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).

Applicant did not pay his taxes when he had his own carpentry business from 2004 
to 2007. Whether due to mismanagement of his personal financial affairs, or his business 
expenses, or both, Applicant did not set funds aside to pay his income taxes. A review of 
recent utility bills shows that Applicant is not behind in his day-to-day expenses. He 
presented several work and personal references, who uniformly attest to his reliability at 
work and at home. Applicant has not allowed his tax matters to negatively affect his work 
performance or his dedication to his duties. Nevertheless, it is well settled that once a 
concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong 
presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990). In light of the delay in addressing his very delinquent 
tax liabilities, and with about $78,842 still outstanding, Applicant needs to demonstrate a 
longer record of tax payments before I can be assured that his financial problems are in the 
past and not likely to recur. Under Applicant’s current circumstances, grant of a security 
clearance is not warranted at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
                                                 
2 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
