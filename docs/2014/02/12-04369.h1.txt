Decision 
______________ 
 
O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, the Government’s File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) and Applicant's Response, I conclude that Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline. 
Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 11, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. The SOR listed 
security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) of the AG. In his Answer to the SOR, notarized on August 6, 2013, 
Applicant admitted 12 of the 14 allegations, and requested a decision based on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 4) 
 
Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
prepared a presentation of the Government’s case in a FORM dated November 11, 
 
2 
 
 
2013.1 The FORM included ten documents (Items 1-10) proffered in support of the DOD 
CAF’s preliminary decision to deny Applicant's request for a security clearance. 
Applicant received the FORM on December 28, 2013. He was given 30 days from the 
date he received the FORM to file a response, and he submitted a timely response 
(Response, pages 1-25). The case was assigned to me on February 3, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated as findings of 
fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the 
FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 53 years old.  He was married in 1982 and divorced in December 
2007. He has two adult children from his first marriage. He married again in 2009. He 
served as an enlisted member of the Navy from 1979 to 1982, and was in the active 
reserve from 1988 to 2005. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1986. He first received a 
security clearance in 1994. Applicant disclosed his financial status and delinquencies in 
his December 2011 security clearance application. (Item 5; Response at p. 3) 
 
After Applicant’s first wife lost her job in about 2006, he had difficulty meeting 
his financial obligations, and his accounts started to become delinquent. Following his 
divorce in 2007, he was required to pay $500 per month in child support for his 
youngest child, as well as alimony, which varied according to his ex-wife’s income. 
Applicant also paid his ex-wife’s mortgage payment and utilities. His obligations to his 
ex-wife and children were current in January 2012. (Item 6) 
 
Applicant stated in his January 2012 security interview that his ex-wife’s 
unemployment, his obligations for her support after the divorce, and the child 
support, resulted in his becoming delinquent in his debts. As of that time, he had 
more than 20 delinquent debts listed in his credit report. He had not had financial 
counseling, and he was unaware of several of the delinquencies. During his 
interview, he stated his intention to obtain his credit report, contact the creditors to 
verify the accuracy of the debts, dispute any invalid debts, and pay all valid debts or 
arrange payment plans. His April 2013 credit report shows 14 delinquent debts, and 
his November 2013 credit report shows 6 past-due debts. (Items 5, 6, 10) 
 
As part of his May 2013 interrogatory response, Applicant completed a 
personal financial statement (PFS). His net monthly income, including his wife’s 
income, is $11,447. His monthly expenses include utilities, insurance, groceries, and 
medical expenses, and total $1,481. He listed monthly debt payments of $1,495. 
(Item 6)

The delinquencies listed in the SOR total approximately $41,000. They 
appear in credit reports dated December 2011, April 2012, and November 2013, (Items 
8-10) as well as July 2013 and January 2014 credit reports Applicant provided with his 
Answer and Response. The status of the debts follows. 
 
Allegation 1.a, Rent, $5,291. Disputed. Applicant paid his rent for 9 months of his 12-
month lease. He then provided notice to the landlord regarding his upcoming military 
transfer. He disputes owing this past-due rent. He filed a dispute with a credit agency, 
which is documented in his July and November 2013 credit reports. The debt does not 
appear on the April 2013 credit report provided by the Government. (Items 4, 7, 9, 10; 
Response) 
 
Allegation 1.b, Medical, $156. Paid. Applicant provided evidence of a payment in May 
2013, and states in his Response that the debt is paid. His 2013 credit report shows the 
account is “Paid” and the balance owed is zero. (Items 4, 9, 10; Response at 15) 
 
Allegation 1.c, Medical, $1,152. Payment plan. Applicant stated at his 2012 security 
interview that he did not recognize this account. However, in his Answer he listed the 
status as “Pending (resolving dispute).” He provided proof of a June 2013 payment of 
$155, and stated he has a payment plan. His November 2013 credit report shows the 
balance has been reduced to $997. (Items 4, 6, 10) 
 
Allegation 1.d, Medical, $117. Paid. Applicant paid the debt in full and provided 
evidence of a May 2013 deduction from his bank account of $121. (Items 4, 7, 9) 
 
Allegation 1.e, Credit card, $1,043. Disputed. Applicant stated in his Answer that the 
original balance was $3,500, and he paid $2,457. His 2011 credit report confirms the 
balance was reduced by $2,457. The creditor charged off the $1,043 remainder. His 
November 2013 credit report indicates he is disputing the remaining $1,043, though 
Applicant's reason is unclear from the record. (Items 4, 8, 10; Response)  
 
Allegation 1.f, Utility, $118. Paid. Applicant provided documentation from the creditor 
dated June 2013, showing he paid the debt in full and the balance is zero. His 
November 2013 credit report also shows the debt is paid. (Items 4, 8, 10) 
 
Allegation 1.g, Unknown type, $754. Paid. Applicant’s 2011 credit report shows that 
this account was transferred to a collection agency. He provided confirmation from the 
collection agency that he paid $345.90 on May 7, 2013, which settled the account. His 
January 2014 credit report shows a zero balance. (Items 4, 7, 8; Response at 13) 
  
Allegation 1.h, Cable account, $1,152. Duplicate. The SOR lists a cable debt of 
$1,152, the same amount as the medical debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant's 2011 
credit report shows that the same collection agency owned a medical debt ($96) and a 
cable debt for Applicant. His other credit reports show that this debt is a past-due 
 
4 
 
 
medical debt of $1,152. The SOR conflates the two debts; allegation 1.h is a duplicate 
of allegation 1.c. I find for the Applicant on allegation 1.h.2  
 
Allegation 1.i, Cable account, $88. Paid. At his security interview in 2012, Applicant 
stated he did not recognize this cable debt. After completing his interrogatory response, 
and prior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant provided a a chart of his debt 
payments, in which he referred to a bank statement showing he paid $97 to this 
creditor. The bank statement is not included in the record. However, the debt does not 
appear on Applicant's April 2013 credit report. (Items 4, 6, 7, 8, 9; Response) 
 
Allegation 1.j, Unknown type, $634. Paid. Applicant's 2011 credit report describes the 
debt as “unknown loan type” and shows that the balance of $634 was charged off in 
2008. When interviewed in 2012, Applicant did not recognize the debt. In his Answer, 
Applicant stated it was paid. The debt does not appear on his April 2013 credit report. 
(Items 4, 6, 8, 9; Response) 
 
Allegation 1.k, Student loan, $5,282.3 Payment plan. Applicant’s student loans were 
deferred while he was in the Navy. This student loan was in collection status in 2011. 
He provided documentation showing that in February 2013, he entered a loan 
rehabilitation program, with a monthly payment plan of $50. His submission to the DOD 
CAF in June 2013 stated the account was current. Applicant's January 2014 credit 
report shows a balance of $3,287. (Items 7-9; Response at 18) 
 
Allegation 1.l, Auto loan, $24,955. Paid. The alleged amount is the original loan 
balance when Applicant purchased a car in 2001. He made timely payments for 
several years. When his first wife lost her job in about 2006, the account became 
delinquent. He contacted the lender and was advised to surrender the vehicle, which 
he did. He stated in his security interview that it was sold at auction. He believed the 
car’s value at the time was $5,600, and listed this delinquent amount in his 2011 
security clearance application. He has not been contacted by the creditor about a 
deficiency balance since he surrendered the car in October 2006. In his 2014 
Response, he stated the debt is paid. It does not appear on his April or November 
2013 credit reports. (Items 5, 6-10; Response) 
 
Allegation 1.m, Medical, $107. Paid. Applicant stated in his security interview that he 
did not recognize the debt. In his Answer to the SOR, he provided a copy of a check 
showing a payment of $107 to the medical creditor, dated August 1, 2013. Although he 
cites the cancelled version of the check in his Response, he did not enclose the 
cancelled check. (Items 4, 8, 9; Response) 
 
                                                          
2 When the same conduct is alleged twice under the same guideline, one of the duplicate allegations 
should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same 
debt alleged twice). 
 
3 Applicant stated in his Answer he believes this SOR allegation was mis-identified, and it refers not to a 
car loan, but to a collection agency with a similar name that owns his student loan debt of $3,404. (Item 4) 
 
5 
 
 
Allegation 1.n, Cable account, $293. Unresolved. In his June 2013 submission to 
the DOD CAF, and in his January 2014 Response, Applicant stated he paid the debt on 
June 14, 2013. However, the record contains no supporting documentation. (Items 7, 8; 
Response) 
 
Allegation 1.o, Unknown type, $126. Resolved. Applicant stated in his 2012 
security interview that he did not recognize this debt, which was listed as on his 
2011credit report as in collection status. However, it does not appear on his July or 
November 2013 credit reports. (Items 6, 8) 
 
Policies 
 
Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, 
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions 
must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the guidelines, commonly 
referred to as the “whole-person” concept. The presence or absence of a disqualifying 
or mitigating condition does not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. 
However, specific applicable guidelines are followed when a case can be measured 
against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access 
to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by 
the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors 
addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). 
 
A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of 
producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or 
revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able 
to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it 
then falls to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.  
 
Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy 
burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, 
the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national 
interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard

compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in 
favor of the Government.7 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information . . . . 
 
I have considered the following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶19:  
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant's delinquent debts, as listed in the SOR, totaled more than $41,000 
(approximately $39,800 after deducting the duplicate allegation). Some have been 
delinquent for several years. His history of financial delinquencies supports 
application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts) and AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  
 
 Under AG ¶ 20, the following conditions could potentially mitigate security 
concerns:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
                                                          
7 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
7 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant's delinquencies are recent because several remain unresolved. 
However, he has made significant efforts over the past three years to reduce his debt. 
Given his conduct, and his sufficient income, it is unlikely that such delinquencies will 
recur. His debt reduction in the past three years reflects well on his trustworthiness and 
reliability. AG ¶ 20(a) applies. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) relates to financial problems stemming from conditions an 
applicant could not foresee or control. Some of Applicant's debts resulted from such 
circumstances. Applicant's ex-wife became unemployed in 2006,  which affected his 
ability to meet the family financial obligations. When they later divorced, he became 
responsible for child support and alimony for his wife. He also continued to help with her 
support by making payments on her mortgage and utilities. He met these obligations, 
but they caused other debts to become delinquent. For full mitigation, an applicant 
must show that he has acted reasonably in response to the unexpected 
circumstances. Applicant has contacted the creditors, disputed debts he believed to be 
invalid, paid numerous debts, and significantly reduced his delinquencies. AG ¶ 20(b) 
applies. 
 
Although Applicant has not received counseling, he has shown a good-faith 
effort to resolve his debts. He provided evidence of actual debt reduction through his 
actions since 2011: at that time, he had more than 20 delinquent debts listed in his 
credit report. He paid numerous debts before the SOR was issued. Additionally, he 
paid eight SOR debts and established payment plans for two other debts. His April 
2013 credit report lists 14 delinquent debts, and his November 2013 credit report shows 
only 6 past-due debts. His financial situation is under control. Based on his 
persistent efforts, and his sufficient income, it is likely he will resolve the remaining 
debts. AG ¶ 20(c) and (d) apply. 
 
Applicant disputed allegations 1.a and 1.e. His credit reports show that, in both 
cases, he informed the credit agencies of his dispute. The debt at allegation 1.a has 
been removed from his credit report. The record is insufficient to show if his dispute 
regarding allegation 1.e is legitimate. He receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(e). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all 
the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the 
 
8 
 
 
appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have also reviewed the 
record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). 
 
 The Appeal Board has held, “. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, 
to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR.” It also stated, 
“There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for 
the payment of such debts one at a time.”8 
 
 Although Applicant has not resolved all of his delinquent debts, he has shown 
diligence in working to pay many of them over the past three years. He stated in his 
security interview that he would contact creditors, and pay or establish payment plans 
for those that were his. He has followed through on that intention and significantly 
reduced his delinquencies. While he had more than 20 delinquent debts in 2011, his 
2013 credit report lists 6. Based on this history, it is likely he will continue to resolve the 
remaining debts. 
 
 A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information shows 
Applicant has satisfied the doubts raised about his suitability for a security clearance. 
For these reasons, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns arising from the 
financial considerations guideline. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: 
 
 Paragraph 1, guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.o   For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified 
information. Applicant's request for a security clearance is granted.
