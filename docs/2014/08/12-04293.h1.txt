FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on December 21, 2011. On 
February 26, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 5, 2014; answered it on April 10, 2014; 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was 
ready to proceed on April 30, 2014, and the case was assigned to me on May 5, 2014. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 
12, 2014, scheduling the hearing for June 17, 2014. At Applicant’s request, the hearing 
 
2 
 
was postponed. On May 14, 2014, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing, 
rescheduling the hearing for July 15, 2014. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until July 29, 2014, to enable 
Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. I did not receive any additional 
evidence by the closing date. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 23, 2014. 
 
Reconsideration 
 
 On August 8, 2014, I contacted Department Counsel by email to ensure that 
Applicant had not sent any additional evidence to her instead of me. (Hearing Exhibit 
(HX) I.) She responded that she had received nothing but that she had left a voicemail 
for Applicant inquiring about a post-hearing submission. (Hearing Exhibit II.) On August 
19, 2014, Applicant submitted copies of previous emails dated July 28 and July 29, 
2014, which I had not received because one letter had been omitted from my email user 
name. Applicant requested that I consider his additional evidence even though it was 
not timely received. (HX III.) 
 
 There is no express authority in Executive Order 10865 or the Directive for an 
administrative judge to reconsider a decision. However, the Appeal Board, relying on 
federal cases recognizing a federal agency’s inherent authority to reconsider its 
decisions, has long held that it has inherent authority to reconsider its decisions. See 
ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009); ISCR Case No. 98-0521 (App. Bd. 
Nov. 23, 1999); ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 1998). In the absence of 
express authority or an express prohibition, I have relied on the Appeal Board’s 
rationale to conclude that I have inherent authority to reconsider my decisions at any 
time until they become final under the provisions of Directive ¶ E3.1.36. Accordingly, I 
have withdrawn my decision of August 15, 2014, and substituted this decision on 
reconsideration. Department Counsel has not objected to my reconsideration and has 
not objected to Applicant’s post-hearing submissions, which have been marked as AX G 
through M and received in evidence. (HX IV.)  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with 
explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 56-year-old safety manager employed by a federal contractor since 
September 2011. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2001. He served on 
active duty in the U.S. Air Force from February 1977 to December 1981 and was 
honorably discharged. He served in the Air Force Reserve from February 1983 to 
February 1985 and was honorably discharged. He received a security clearance in 
September 2004. In 2010, Applicant completed several training courses to prepare for 
his current position as a safety manager. (AX C, D, and E.) One of Applicant’s 
 
3 
 
colleagues, a retired Air Force chief master sergeant, and his security manager, a 
retired Air Force master sergeant, submitted letters of recommendation, both describing 
Applicant as reliable, loyal, and a “great coworker.” (AX A and B.) 
 
 Applicant married in December 1992. He and his wife have no children, but his 
two adult stepsons and a 14-year-old step-grandson live with them.  
 
Applicant and his wife purchased a time-share vacation home in the mid-1990s. 
The payments became delinquent about a year after they purchased it. (Tr. 42.) They 
did not make any efforts to resolve the debt, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, until Applicant 
received the SOR.  
 
 Around 2000, one of Applicant’s stepsons and his girlfriend had a son. When the 
girlfriend left the stepson and abandoned their three-month-old son, Applicant and his 
wife took custody of the infant and raised him. (Tr. 31-32.)  
 
 Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 2002 
and received a discharge in January 2003. (GX 2 at 7-8; GX 4 at 4; GX 5.) Applicant 
testified that the additional expense of caring for his step-grandson was a major 
contributor to their inability to pay their bills. (Tr. 32.) The payments on the time-share 
were not included in their bankruptcy discharge.  
 
 In 2006, as a result of a down-sizing by Applicant’s employer, he was transferred 
to a new location far distant from his old location. At his old location, he and his wife 
managed their apartment complex in return for a rent-free apartment. After his transfer, 
he incurred additional living expenses and could not afford the lease payments on his 
car. He surrendered the car, incurring a penalty for early termination of the lease, 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. The leasing company obtained a judgment against him. In 
November 2010, he negotiated an agreement to pay $100 per month. (GX 2 at 34; GX 3 
at 2; Tr. 34; Enclosure to Answer.) He has been making regular payments in 
accordance with his agreement. (GX 2 at 35; AX G.)  
 
 In late 2006 or early 2007, Applicant purchased a computer for his step-
grandson, who was then six or seven years old. He stopped making payments shortly 
after the purchase, because he could afford them. (Tr. 49-50.) The debt, alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.c, was charged off and referred for collection in October 2006. (GX 3 at 2; GX 4 at 
11.)  
 
 In early 2007, Applicant and his wife purchased another time-share for about 
$8,300, with a 10% down payment. (Tr. 42, 60.) Applicant failed to make the monthly 
payments beginning in February 2007. In March 2014, he settled the debt, alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.b, for about $1,892. (AX F; Tr. 48.) When asked why he purchased a second 
time-share at a time when he was in financial distress, he attributed the purchase to a 
“pressure sale.” (Tr. 58.) 
 
 
4 
 
 In 2008, one of Applicant’s stepsons moved in with them. A year later, the 
second stepson moved in. (Tr. 35.) Neither of his stepsons finished high school, making 
it difficult for them to find steady employment. (Tr. 33-37.) His two stepsons pay rent 
totaling about $400 per month. (GX 2 at 15; Tr. 41.) In 2010, Applicant’s wife was laid 
off from her job and has been unable to find new employment. (Tr. 36.) 
 
 In response to DOHA financial interrogatories in October 2013, Applicant 
submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) reflecting net monthly income of about 
$5,662; expenses of about $3,981; debt payments of about $255; and a net monthly 
remainder of about $1,426.1 (GX 2 at 15.) The PFS reflects spousal income of $570, 
which is her Social Security retirement pension. The PFS also reflects monthly $114.50 
payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a tax debt of $1,825. Applicant 
testified that the debt was incurred for tax year 2009 because insufficient taxes were 
withheld from his pay. He also testified that he owes taxes for tax years 2011 and 2012 
because of insufficient withholding. (Tr. 55-56, 61-62.) He has continued to make 
regular monthly payments on his tax debt. (AX H through M.) The tax debts are not 
alleged in the SOR.2  
 
 When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed numerous delinquent debts, 
including his federal tax debt for 2009, the computer-purchase debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, and 
the car-lease debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. During a personal subject interview (PSI) in 
January 2012, he disclosed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the more recent time-share 
loan. He did not recognize 11 debts reflected on his December 2011 credit report. (GX 2 
at 7-9.) In response to October 2013 financial interrogatories, he provided evidence that 
he had resolved several debts and successfully disputed several debts that are not 
alleged in the SOR. (GX 2 at 17-41.)  
 
 At the hearing, Applicant testified that in March 2014, after receiving the SOR, he 
borrowed about $3,500 from his 401(k) retirement account and used it to resolve the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. (Tr. 37, 43.) Payments on the 401(k) loan are about 
$336 per month. (Tr. 44.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted documentary 
evidence that he resolved the time-share debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a on March 15, 2014. 
At the hearing, he submitted documentary evidence that he resolved the time-share 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b on March 19, 2014. (AX F; Tr. 48.) In his response to the 
SOR and at the hearing, he claimed that he settled the computer debt, alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.c with a collection company on March 19, 2014. (Enclosure to Answer; Tr. 50-51.) 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s PFS reflected a net monthly remainder of $457, but that number is inconsistent with the 
amounts reflected for net income, monthly expenses, and debt payments. 
 
2 Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge and his current federal income tax debt were not alleged in 
the SOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to 
decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful 
rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006). I have considered his bankruptcy discharge and federal income tax debt for these limited 
purposes.

However, the account numbers and the amount due reflected on the credit report for on 
the collection company do not match the account number and amount due for the 
original creditor. The evidence does not establish that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is settled. 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
6 
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges four delinquent debts: a time-share debt for $900 (SOR ¶ 1.a); 
a second time-share debt for $5,661 (SOR ¶ 1.b); a debt for a computer for $2,746 
(SOR ¶ 1.c); and a car-lease termination penalty of $2,898 (SOR ¶ 1.d). The concern 
under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, testimony at the hearing, and credit reports establish the 
following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 
7 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant did not resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
and 1.b until after he received the SOR. The computer debt in SOR 1.c is not resolved, 
and the judgment for the car-lease debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is not yet satisfied. His delinquent 
debts were numerous and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely 
to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s involuntary transfer to a new 
location and the expenses associated with the transfer were circumstances beyond his 
control. However, his decision to allow his two adult stepsons to live with him and to 
assume responsibility for his step-grandson, while compassionate and generous, was a 
voluntary decision. His purchases of two time-share properties and his purchase of an 
expensive computer for a young boy were voluntary acts. Furthermore, he has not 
acted responsibly. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c became delinquent around 
2006 or 2007, but he took no meaningful actions to resolve them until he realized after 
his January 2012 PSI that his delinquent debts were an impediment to continuing his 
security clearance. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is still unresolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. It is likely that Applicant was required to obtain 
financial counseling in connection with his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2002. He 
has not received counseling regarding the debts he accumulated after his bankruptcy 
discharge. He has resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, but he did so by borrowing 
money and incurring another debt. He settled a third debt with a collection company, but 
 
8 
 
he did not produce evidence showing that the collection company with whom he settled 
held the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. In November 2010, he negotiated a payment plan 
for the car-lease debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, and he has submitted documentary evidence of 
compliance with his agreement up to the present. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. “Good faith” within the meaning of this mitigating 
condition means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Payment of debts motivated by the pressure of qualifying for a 
security clearance is not a “good-faith effort.” Furthermore, a security clearance 
adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure; it is an evaluation of an individual’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 
2010). This mitigating condition is established for the car-lease debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, 
because he negotiated a payment plan and began making payments well before his PSI 
in January 2012, his responses to DOHA interrogatories in October 2013, or his receipt 
of the SOR in March 2014. However, his efforts to resolve the remaining debts in the 
SOR were motivated by pressure to retain his security clearance, and those belated 
efforts do not mitigate the security concerns raised by his history of financial 
irresponsibility.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) has limited applicability. Applicant successfully disputed several debts 
after being confronted with them during his January 2012 PSI. However, he has not 
disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
9 
 
 Applicant has served his country for many years, in uniform and as an employee 
of federal contractors. He has held a security clearance since September 2004. He has 
been exceptionally generous to his stepsons and step-grandson. On the other hand, he 
has repeatedly demonstrated bad financial judgment. He bought a time-share in the 
1990s, allowed the payments to become delinquent within a year, and ignored the debt 
until he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. He bought an expensive 
computer for a young boy in 2006 or 2007, shortly after surrendering his leased car 
because he could not afford the payments. He bought a second time-share in 2007, 
notwithstanding his precarious financial situation, and started defaulting on his 
payments almost immediately. To his credit, he is making payments on the car-lease 
judgment and his federal income tax debt. He has resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 
1.b by incurring a new debt. Overall, his financial history and present financial situation 
leave me with doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and 
E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. 
Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
