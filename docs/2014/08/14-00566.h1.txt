MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant and his spouse underpaid their federal income taxes for tax years 2008 
through 2012. Despite ongoing payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since July 
2009, they owed $23,366.42 in delinquent federal taxes for 2009 through 2012 as of June 
2014. In May 2014, they paid off past-due state taxes of $2,263.74 for tax year 2012, but 
concerns persist about Applicant’s handling of his tax matters and financial affairs generally. 
Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On March 26, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
 
2 
 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
On April 22, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, and he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On May 15, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him. On May 27, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for June 18, 2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and 15 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-O) were admitted into evidence without objection. A chart, which 
was prepared by Department Counsel as a supplement to his oral closing argument, was 
accepted into the record as a hearing exhibit. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript 
(Tr.) received on June 27, 2014. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed 
delinquent federal taxes of $25,452.78 for tax years 2009 through 2012 (SOR 1.a) and 
delinquent state taxes of $2,263.74 for tax year 2012 (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted that he 
owed delinquent federal and state taxes as of the date of SOR, but he disputed the alleged 
balances. He indicated that tax returns were filed as required by law, and that he paid off 
his state tax debt of $1,249.09 on April 16, 2014. Applicant added that he was repaying his 
federal tax debt under a plan established with the IRS. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is 49 years old. He and his spouse have been married since July 1990. 
They have a 22-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old son. (GE 1; Tr. 61-62.) In December 
2012, Applicant began working under the employment of a staffing agency in the 
government security compliance unit of a defense contractor. After his interim security 
clearance was withdrawn in late February 2013, Applicant was removed from his position. 
As of June 2014, he was considered an eligible employee by the staffing agency, but he 
was not being paid. (Tr. 50-53.) He is seeking a secret clearance so that he can be recalled 
to work for the defense contractor. (Tr. 53.) 
 
Applicant retired on August 1, 2007, after 20 years in state law enforcement. With 
overtime, Applicant estimates that he earned about $80,000 in 2006. (Tr. 22.) During his 
career working under the direction and authority of the state police, he was involved in 
numerous criminal investigations. He worked closely at times with federal law enforcement 
personnel and had access to highly sensitive information. Applicant served professionally 
and with distinction. (GE 1; Answer; AEs L, O.) In July 2006, he was given a meritorious 
service award, recognized by the state, for his “generous contributions” to the state and its 
3 
 
citizens. On his retirement, Applicant was recognized for his outstanding service by a field 
office of the U.S. Federal Air Marshals, by the state department of public safety, and by the 
state police union. (AE O.) 
 
 While he was still employed in law enforcement, Applicant earned his master’s 
degree in management in August 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 45.) After he retired, Applicant started 
his own investigations business. (GEs 1, 2; AE J.) He obtained a private detective’s license 
from the state, which has been renewed every two years through October 19, 2015.
1
 From 
November 2007 to May 2008, he held a part-time job with the state’s transportation 
department. Also in May 2008, Applicant had some part-time hours as a field investigator 
working out of his house, and as an assistant program coordinator and substitute teacher 
for a summer program. From July 2008 to September 2008, Applicant was employed full 
time as a security manager for a state summer jobs program. (GEs 1, 2.) 
 
Applicant was employed as a plant security manager by a firearms manufacturer 
from September 2008 to October 2010. Applicant was responsible for ensuring the 
company’s compliance with several government contracts. During his tenure, Applicant 
fired security guards for theft. (GE 2.) An armed security guard was fired in December 2008 
on suspicions (later confirmed) of vandalism and attempted theft of a rifle and laptop 
computer at work. Another security guard was arrested in early 2009 for stealing 
Blackberry phones from the company. (AE G; Tr. 35-40.) Applicant resigned from his 
position in October 2010 because of “professional differences.” His supervisor was not 
receptive to his suggestions to revamp the department, and he could no longer deal with 
the stress. (GE 2; Tr. 35-37.) With bonuses, Applicant’s wages had reached $70,000 a 
year, and he knew resigning would strain his family’s finances. (Tr. 37, 82.) 
 
Applicant has worked as a part-time adjunct instructor in criminal justice, homeland 
security, and public speaking since about January 2008. (GE 1.) He filed for unemployment 
compensation to supplement his part-time earnings as in instructor. His business income 
as a private detective was only $2,234 of his and his spouse’s $148,659 in adjusted gross 
income in 2010. (GE 2.) On November 12, 2010, a state employment security administrator 
denied Applicant unemployment benefits, finding that he left his work with the firearms 
manufacturer voluntarily without good cause. Applicant appealed, and on March 28, 2011, 
an associate appeals referee awarded him unemployment benefits. The appeals referee 
found that Applicant had suffered job-related stress leading to a medical condition for  
which he received treatment, and that the company did not follow Applicant’s 
recommendations to properly staff the office, to discharge an employee with a history of 
misconduct, and to improve security at the workplace. Applicant collected unemployment 
compensation retroactive from October 24, 2010 to March 2011. (GEs 1, 2; AE F.) 
 
In March 2011, Applicant began working full time at $10 an hour as a security officer 
for a hotel. (GE 1; Tr. 83.) In October 2011, Applicant was directed by the manager on duty 
to deliver a newspaper to a hotel guest by use of his master key without notifying the guest 
of his entry. Applicant complied with the manager’s order after informing her that he did not 
feel comfortable doing so. The guest was awake and complained of a violation of his 
                                                 
1 
Applicant paid $800 to renew his private detective’s license in 2009. In 2013, he paid $1,000. (AE I.) 
4 
 
privacy. When Applicant told the hotel manager that he would no longer comply with the 
directive, he was discharged by his employer. (GEs 1, 2; AE H; Tr. 41-43.) 
 
Applicant applied for unemployment compensation. On November 14, 2011, he was 
denied unemployment benefits on the basis that he had been terminated for wilful 
misconduct. Applicant appealed, and on January 23, 2012, an appeals referee granted him 
unemployment, finding that Applicant would have continued delivering newspapers to 
guests if allowed to give proper notice and that the hotel’s directive was unreasonable. 
Applicant collected unemployment retroactive from October 23, 2011, to November 2012. 
(AE H.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse opened numerous consumer credit accounts over the 
years to pay for his business and their home expenses. As debt accumulated, they 
transferred balances and consolidated debt trying to keep up with the payments. They 
stopped paying on some accounts in 2009 and 2010. When they became seriously 
financially overextended, they consulted a bankruptcy attorney, who advised them to stop 
payments to all their creditors. Applicant completed online financial counseling required of 
a bankruptcy. (Tr. 84.) The night before Applicant and his spouse were to file their petition, 
they elected to not pursue the bankruptcy. Instead, his spouse began contacting their 
creditors to make repayment arrangements. (GE 1; Tr. 49, 95-96.) Between June 2010 and 
January 2013, they settled approximately $190,000 in consumer credit debt balances, in 
part with funds from Applicant’s 401(k) from his employment with the firearms company.
2
 
(GEs 2, 4; Tr. 96.) 
 
In December 2012, Applicant was placed by a staffing agency as a contract security 
manager at pay of $85,000 annually in the government security compliance unit of a 
defense contractor. (Tr. 43.) On December 13, 2012, Applicant completed and certified to 
the accuracy of an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), never 
having previously held a DOD security clearance. Applicant disclosed that he fell behind on 
numerous debts due to lack of income from his investigations business, unsteady 
employment, and job losses between 2007 and 2009. He explained that after accounts 
became delinquent, he spoke to an attorney about bankruptcy. He and his spouse elected 
instead to make repayment arrangements (“Currently making payments and working out 
settlements.”). Applicant listed delinquent federal income taxes of about $15,000 for 2009 
through 2011, which he arranged to repay at $400 a month, and about $1,000 in state 
income taxes “for approximate year 2011 with payments.” Additionally, a credit card lender 
had placed a $15,000 lien against his property, but he was making weekly payments of $35 
to resolve the debt.
3
  (GE 1.) Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance around 
December 21, 2012. (AE K; Tr. 48.) 
 
                                                 
2 
The settlement letters in GE 2 confirm the accounts were resolved, but only a few show the amount paid. 
They show Applicant or his spouse paid $5,000 in January 2013 to settle a $17,003 debt; $1,265 in March 
2011 to settle a $2,271 debt; and $2,000 in December 2009 and $560 in May 2010 to resolve his spouse’s 
credit card accounts on which he was an authorized user. (GE 2.) 
 
3 
The judgment lien was released on February 18, 2013, on satisfaction of the debt. (GE 2.) 
 
5 
 
 As of January 2013, Applicant was making timely payments on his mortgage, 
although he had been late 30 days five times. Applicant had two student loans in his name 
with balances of $11,501 and $6,162, which had been delinquent 60 days but were current 
as of November 2012. (GE 4.) 
 
On January 10, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he owed federal 
income taxes for 2009 through 2011 [sic] because he did not have the funds to pay the 
taxes owed when he filed his returns. He indicated he had complied with his IRS payments 
of $400 a month and with his state tax payments of $100 a month for 2010 and 2011. 
Applicant was unable to provide specific information about the delinquent consumer credit 
debts on his record, including those which had been settled for less than the balance, 
because his spouse paid the bills. He had incurred the consumer credit debt to purchase 
household items, to build a deck, and to pay for gas and other bills. Applicant expressed 
his intent to pay all his debts by 2018. (GE 2.) 
 
Around February 27, 2013, Applicant was informed that his interim security 
clearance had been withdrawn, so the defense contractor could no longer use his services. 
He went back on unemployment, which was around $267 a week. Applicant also had his 
retirement pay of $3,132.45 a month and his spouse’s wages to meet household expenses 
and make his tax payments. (GE 2; Tr. 18, 50.) 
 
By mid-January 2014, Applicant and his spouse had satisfied most of the delinquent 
consumer credit accounts on his record. (GE 2.) Two credit card accounts, with balances of 
$4,115 and $10,340, had been charged off as of November 2013. Applicant was an 
authorized user of those accounts, which had been current until August 2013. (GE 3.) 
 
 In response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant completed a personal financial 
statement showing net monthly income of $9,384 ($4,800 his spouse’s net salary and 
$4,584 his retirement and unemployment income), monthly expenses of $2,754, and 
$3,575 in debt payments ($2,556 to the mortgage, $50 to a $610 credit card balance, $266 
to his past-due state taxes, $500 to his federal taxes, and $203 to $16,648 in student 
loans). (GE 2.) 
 
 Available tax records show that Applicant and his spouse filed timely tax returns, but 
they underpaid their federal income taxes for tax years 2008 through 2012. On adjusted 
gross income of $164,366 for tax year 2008, they owed $2,963, of which they paid $200 
when they filed their return. They contacted the IRS about repayment, and on June 1, 
2009, they entered into an agreement with the IRS to repay their debt in $200 monthly 
installments. They missed one payment, in October 2010, and were assessed a penalty 
and interest for the late payment. Their delinquent tax debt for 2008 was satisfied around 
December 2010. (AE D; Tr. 34.) 
 
 On adjusted gross income of $231,907 for tax year 2009, Applicant and his spouse 
underpaid their federal income taxes by $16,330. On December 16, 2010, they established 
an installment agreement with the IRS to repay the debt at $300 a month. They made their 
6 
 
payments through mid-November 2011. They made no payments in December 2011, 
January 2012, or February 2012. In March 2012, they began paying $405 per month to the 
IRS. They missed payments in December 2012 and June 2013.
4 
In October 2013, their 
monthly payment was increased to $500. (AE E; Tr. 92.) On adjusted gross income of 
$208,382 for tax year 2010, they underpaid their taxes by $8,221. On adjusted gross 
income of $176,259 for tax year 2011, they underpaid their taxes by $864. On adjusted 
gross income of $197,412 for 2012, they underpaid their federal taxes by $5,628. As in 
previous years, Applicant and his spouse sent in no payments with their returns. (GE 2.) 
 
 As of January 1, 2014, their unpaid federal tax debt with penalties and interest was 
$25,362.78 ($8,744.90 for 2009; $9,675.88 for 2010, $974.35 for 2011; and $5,967.65 for 
2012). Applicant and his spouse paid $500 a month to the IRS through at least June 2014, 
and those payments were applied to their tax liability for 2009. (AEs B, C, E.) As of June 4, 
2014, their outstanding federal tax balance was $23,366.42, which included penalties and 
interest ($6,366.65 for 2009; $9,891.27 for 2010; $996.91 for 2011; and $6,111.59 for 
2012). (AE C.) Applicant intends to make at least his monthly minimum payment (currently 
$500) until his federal tax debt is satisfied. (Tr. 93-94.) As of mid-June 2014, Applicant and 
his spouse had filed for an extension to submit their federal income tax return for tax year 
2014. Applicant anticipated their return would be filed before the deadline. He indicated 
that he “probably” will owe federal or state income taxes for 2013. (Tr. 65.)  
 
Applicant and his spouse underpaid their state income taxes for 2012. On 
September 12, 2013, they arranged to repay the debt, which was $2,263.74 as of 
December 2013, at $265 per month. (GE 2; AE A.) With a final payment of $11.44 on May 
7, 2014, they satisfied their state tax debt. (AE A.)  
 
 As of May 13, 2014, Applicant was making timely payments on four credit card 
accounts: a business account with a $561 balance (opened in November 2011); an 
individual account with a $277 balance (opened in October 2010); an account with a 
$5,216 balance (opened in March 1999); and an account with a $390 balance (opened in 
March 2013). Two credit card accounts on which he was an authorized user had been 
charged off by November 2013. Last activity on the accounts was in August 2013. 
Applicant was making monthly payments of $70 and $132 on two student loans for his 
graduate study (Tr. 71), which had respective balances of $5,646 and $10,538. He and his 
spouse were $4,018 past due on their mortgage as of March 2014, although they were 
making reduced payments of approximately $1,700 under a partial payment agreement. 
Applicant’s credit report shows that they were past due 30 days on their account seven 
times in the last two years. (GE 3; Tr. 70.) 
 
                                                 
4 
Applicant testified that to his knowledge, he and his spouse have not missed any payments to the IRS. (Tr. 
63-64.) He assumed that had they missed a payment, they would be considered in default by the IRS. (Tr. 91.) 
IRS records show that payments since February 7, 2011, have been applied to their federal tax debt for tax 
year 2009. They made no payments after November 14, 2011 until March 1, 2012, when the amount 
increased to $405 per month. IRS records do not show any payments in December 2012 or June 2013. (AE 
E.) 
7 
 
 Applicant’s spouse has worked as a business manager for a nonprofit organization 
for more than ten years. (Tr. 75.) Her monthly take-home pay is around $4,800. (Tr. 67.) As 
of mid-June 2014, Applicant was still receiving unemployment compensation, although it 
was scheduled to end soon. (Tr. 68.) Applicant estimates the current balance of his primary 
checking account to be between $200 and $1,000. He has $100 in a savings account and 
another $300 in a credit union account from which he pays for some life insurance 
coverage. (Tr. 72-73.) He has about $200 in his business account. (Tr. 73.) 
 
 Applicant’s daughter recently graduated from college and lives on her own. (Tr. 62.) 
Last year, she had an unpaid internship, so Applicant and his spouse paid her living 
expenses, which were “close to $3,000 or $6,000.” (Tr. 79.) Applicant’s son just finished his 
freshman year in college. (Tr. 77-78.) Applicant provided between $500 and $600 monthly 
to his children (primarily his daughter) for their expenses in college during the 2013/2014 
academic year. Their tuition was covered by student loans, which are “partially in their 
name[s].” (Tr. 77-78.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
8 
 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F articulates several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG ¶ 
19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” are implicated by Applicant’s record of income tax delinquency. 
Although Applicant and his spouse filed annual returns, they paid only $200 of $2,963 in 
federal taxes owed for 2008 when they submitted their return. They paid nothing with their 
returns toward their tax debts of $6,176.21 for 2009; $8,553.20 for 2010; $908.81 for 2011; 
and $5,867.07 for 2012. In June 2009, they entered into the first of yearly installment 
agreements with the IRS to repay their late taxes for 2008 through 2012. Even with 
ongoing payments to the IRS since July 30, 2009, they owed delinquent federal taxes of 
$25,362.78 for tax years 2009 through 2012 as of January 2014. In addition, as of 
December 26, 2013, Applicant and his spouse had a delinquent state income tax liability of 
$2,263.74 that they repaid at $265 per month. 
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply. Applicant and his spouse’s tax problems started in 2009, but they 
continued through at least September 2013, when they filed their federal and state income 
tax returns for 2012 and did not submit payment with their returns. 
 
9 
 
 Applicant cites reduction in income and loss of employment as reasons why he has 
not been able to pay his taxes with his returns for the past few years. (Tr. 73.) Loss of 
income is a circumstance contemplated within AG ¶ 20(b), which provides as follows: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 Applicant retired from a 20-year career in law enforcement effective August 1, 2007. 
He opened his own private investigations business, which did not prove profitable. 
Applicant may reasonably have not foreseen the difficulty obtaining clientele for his 
business. Applicant was not without income in that he had his state pension, which netted 
him around $3,516 a month, albeit less than his previous wages. In September 2008, he 
began working for the firearms manufacturer. Applicant and his spouse’s adjusted gross 
income for 2009 was $231,907. Had they handled their finances responsibly, they should 
have been able to pay most, if not all, of their $2,963 tax underpayment for 2008 when they 
filed their federal return in 2009. Similarly, their adjusted gross income was $208,382 in 
2010; $176,259 in 2011; and $197,412 in 2012, which should have been enough to cover 
at least some of the taxes owed when they filed their returns. They owed only $864 for tax 
year 2011. To a large extent, their financial difficulties were caused by overreliance on 
consumer credit. Applicant and his spouse were so far in debt that they contemplated filing 
for bankruptcy. Between 2010 and January 2014, Applicant and his spouse settled about 
$190,000 of consumer credit debt, many accounts for less than the full balance owed.

Even so, AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply to the financial judgment concerns raised by his failure 
to comply with his tax payment obligations for several years, including for tax years 2009 
and 2010 when he had full-time employment. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” are established with respect to Applicant’s state tax liability 
alleged in SOR 1.b. Applicant and his spouse satisfied their delinquent state taxes for 2012 
by repayment from September 2013 to May 2014. Concerning their sizeable federal tax 
liability, Applicant and his spouse have had installment agreements in place with the IRS 
since June 2009. They resolved their delinquent taxes for 2008 around December 2010. 
Payments since February 2011 have been applied to tax year 2009 to reduce their joint

There is no SOR allegation concerning his many delinquent consumer credit accounts, presumably because 
of his efforts to address them between 2010 and 2014. These debts are relevant because Applicant and his 
spouse gave them priority over paying their taxes when due. The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the 
administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an 
applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 
2012).

liability for that year from $17,276.21 (including interest and penalties as of November 
2010) to $6,366.65 as of June 4, 2014. Yet, with interest and penalties, they still owe 
$23,366.42 in past-due federal taxes for 2009 through 2012.  
 
 The DOHA Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to pay off each 
of his delinquent balances before he can be granted security clearance eligibility. It is 
enough that he have a credible plan in place and that he has taken significant steps to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant and his spouse’s installment agreements with the IRS required monthly 
payments of $200 initially, then $300 from February 2011 through February 2012, and 
$405 from March 2012 to September 2013. Since October 2013, they have been required 
to pay $500 a month. Applicant and his spouse have a track record of payments to the 
IRS. However, while Applicant believes that they have missed no payments, IRS records 
show no payments in December 2012 or June 2013. Available credit records show that he 
had an $11,582 credit card debt in collection as of December 2012. As of June 2013, 
Equifax was reporting that the debt had been paid after charge off, although the amount 
paid is not shown. Available funds may have gone to other debts, but missed payments to 
the IRS undermine confidence in Applicant’s financial judgment. His spouse may be 
handling their financial affairs, but Applicant has an obligation to ensure that debts are 
being paid on time. 
 
 Applicant has been without full-time employment since late February 2013, when his 
interim clearance was withdrawn. Despite Applicant’s unemployment, they appear to have 
sufficient income to pay their expenses. Applicant’s and his spouse’s net monthly 
discretionary income has exceeded $2,000, even after accounting for $500 to $600 per 
month for their children’s college expenses. Yet, as of March 2014, they were making only 
partial payments on their mortgage, which was considered $4,018 past due. Over the 
previous 24 months, they had been 30 days late on their mortgage seven times. As of May 
2014, Applicant had two outstanding charged-off credit card accounts with balances of 
$4,115 and $10,340 on his credit record. His previous credit report of January 2013 shows 
he was only an authorized user on those accounts, which are likely his spouse’s legal 
responsibility. It is unclear whether Applicant knows about those delinquencies, but he is 
aware that he and his spouse are paying less than their full mortgage. (Tr. 70.) Applicant 
has not yet persuaded me that his financial situation is currently under control to the point 
where he can be counted on to comply with his income tax payment obligations. AG ¶ 
20(c) and AG ¶ 20(d) do not fully mitigate the financial considerations concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).

The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the

Applicant and his spouse did not have sufficient taxes withheld from their income 
and his pension to cover their federal tax liability for tax years 2008 through 2012, or their 
state tax liability for 2012. Instead of paying their federal taxes when due, they focused on 
their consumer credit card debt, which was excessive. Applicant and his spouse are 
credited with settling about $190,000 of consumer credit debt from 2010 to 2014, although 
several of the accounts were settled for less than the full balance owed. Applicant had a 
distinguished career in law enforcement, and he understandably had ethical concerns with 
previous jobs which ultimately led to periods of unemployment for him. Nevertheless, it is 
well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990). Applicant’s and 
his spouse’s annual adjusted gross income has fluctuated but also exceeded $150,000 a 
year for the past five years. Applicant could reasonably be expected to have complied with 
his income tax payment obligations. With $23,366.42 in delinquent federal income taxes 
owed as of early June 2014, and evidence of other recent financial problems (e.g., the late 
payments on his mortgage), it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
