GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 22, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On April 18, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 6, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated May 
19, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on July 1, 2014. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2014. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on July 25, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
August 12, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and 14 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE N) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2014. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. He 
submitted an additional document which were marked as exhibit AE O and admitted into 
evidence without objection. The record closed on August 26, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., 1.g., and 1.h.). He denied the 
two remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.). Applicant’s answers and explanations are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
August 2013, he has served as a test engineer.2 Applicant was unemployed on several 
occasions for a variety of reasons: from November 2007 until December 2007; from 
September 2008 until November 2008; from February 2010 until April 2010; and again 
from August 2011 until September 2011.3 During some of those periods, he received 
either unemployment compensation or financial assistance from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs while attending school.4 He served on active duty in an enlisted 
capacity with the U.S. Navy from July 1997 until November 2007, when he was 
discharged for alcohol rehabilitation failure and issued an honorable discharge 
certificate.5 Applicant held a secret security clearance while serving on active duty, and 
again since July 2007.6

Applicant graduated from high school in May 1997.7 He attended two different 
universities while on active duty and for some time thereafter, and in May 2013, he was 
awarded a bachelor’s degree in technical management.8 He is currently enrolled in a 
master’s degree program. He was married in May 2001, separated in 2007, and 
divorced in February 2010.9 He has no children. 
 
Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his active military service, Applicant was awarded the Meritorious Unit 
Commendation, the Good Conduct Medal (two awards), the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service 
Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (six awards), the Overseas Service Ribbon, 
and the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Badge.10  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2007. While he 
was on active duty, he was always current on his bills.11 Following his discharge in 
November 2007, Applicant found it “kind of rough” when he first got out of the military, 
and was unemployed for two months. He also separated from his wife due to his prior 
14 military deployments, and incurred additional expenses by maintaining separate 
households for his wife and himself.12 With insufficient money to maintain his monthly 
payments, some accounts became delinquent. However, once Applicant obtained new 
employment, he went overseas in an effort to generate additional income. He was 
deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan on three occasions in support of various combat 
operations.13 During 2008 and 2009, he addressed and resolved a significant number of 
delinquent accounts, and managed to do so by making between $5,000 and $6,000 in 
payments.14  
Applicant’s next period of financial difficulty arose in 2010. In addition to initially 
helping his wife with her separate household, he also assisted her to relocate to her

support his contention that he had established a meaningful track record of resolving a substantial number of non-
SOR accounts during that time period. Instead of accepting the documents and marking them as evidence, without 
objection from Department Counsel, I took official notice that Applicant had established a meaningful track record of 
resolving a substantial number of non-SOR accounts during 2008 and 2009.

home country. He had previously made some poor investments in the stock market, and 
some of the money he had saved was mismanaged.15 Once again, he was unemployed 
for several months. With insufficient money to maintain his monthly payments, 
especially after he no longer had his wife’s income to assist him, some accounts 
became delinquent.  
At some unspecified point Applicant approached a financial counselor at his 
church and sought assistance. She guided him on how to pay some of his accounts and 
how to reduce his debt.16 Applicant recently furnished a personal financial statement. A 
review of that document reveals a total monthly net income of $4,260.90. With routine 
monthly living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and transportation, as well as 
debt payments of $2,689.00, he has approximately $1,571.90 available for discretionary 
spending or savings.17 All of Applicant’s newer accounts are current.18 
The SOR identified eight delinquent debts that had been placed for collection or 
charged off, as generally reflected by an October 2013 credit report.19 Some accounts 
listed in the credit report have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or 
collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit report, in some 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. While the SOR does not include complete or even 
partial account numbers, several accounts in the credit reports are listed with only 
partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current 
status, according to the credit report, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
The debts listed in the SOR can be divided into three separate categories: (1) 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full; 
(2) those that are currently being paid under a repayment agreement; and (3) those for 
which repayment plans and settlements may have been discussed, but which payments 
have not yet commenced.  
The largest number of accounts listed in the SOR fall within the first category - 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full. 
There was a mobile phone account with one provider with two different collection 
agencies or debt purchasers (SOR ¶ 1.c.) for $765 and (SOR ¶ 1.d.) for $640 that were 
placed for collection.20 It appears that the most recent activity, such as the date of the

last payment or the last charge, on the account occurred in July 2010.21 The account 
was transferred from one collection agent to the other in September 2013.22 Applicant 
denied having two separate accounts with the same provider, and contended the two 
allegations refer to the same account.23 He paid the most recent collection agent in 
August 2014, and was advised that the account would be deleted from his credit 
report.24 Despite having two different account numbers (one for each collection agent) 
reflected in the credit report, based on the available evidence, I conclude that the 
allegations refer to the same account; that the account has been paid in full; and it has 
been resolved. Department Counsel concurred in that conclusion.25  
A telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.e.) for $534 was placed for collection.26 Applicant 
and the collection agent agreed to settle the account for $277, and that amount was 
paid, leaving a zero balance.27 The account has been resolved.  
A utility bill (SOR ¶ 1.f.) for $105 was placed for collection.28 The bill was paid in 
full, leaving a zero balance.29 The account has been resolved.  
An employment search-related account (SOR ¶ 1.g.) for $80 was placed for 
collection.30 Applicant paid the collection agent $80.07, leaving a zero balance.31 The 
account has been resolved.  
The second category of accounts alleged in the SOR - those that are currently 
being paid under a repayment agreement, is as follows. There is an unspecified type of 
account, thought to be a credit card or possibly a vehicle loan, from a credit union (SOR 
¶ 1.a.) for $6,756 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser as a

phone which he displayed to Department Counsel. Based on the digital display, Department Counsel was satisfied 
that the account had been paid and resolved, and he moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing the allegation. There 
being no objection, I granted the motion and amended the SOR by deleting SOR ¶ 1.f. Tr. at 22.

factoring company account.32 It was subsequently sold to another debt purchaser.33 
Applicant approached the initial collection agent and they agreed to a repayment plan 
calling for monthly payments of $100. After the account was sold the second time, the 
new collection agent agreed to eventually settle the account for $4,000.34 Applicant has 
been making his monthly payments since before the SOR was issued, and by January 
2014, the remaining balance had been reduced to $6,373.27.35 Applicant intends to 
keep making his monthly payments for the next few months until he can accumulate 
enough funds to make the final $4,000 pay-off.36 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
An automobile loan from the same credit union (SOR ¶ 1.h.) with a high credit of 
$31,473 was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a collection agent.37 The 
SOR allegation is that the account was charged off in the amount of $22,959.56. When 
interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 
November 2013, both Applicant and the investigator referred to this account and the 
one in SOR ¶ 1.a. interchangeably and indicated the remaining balance, as of the 
interview, should be around $6,000.38 There is no evidence to support the allegation 
that any amount had been charged off. Applicant contends he and the collection agent 
have an agreed repayment plan in place under which he is paying $200 per month over 
a period of six months at a time, until such time as he is able to make a final settlement 
of $7,600.39 While Applicant submitted a copy of the plan approved by the collection 
agent, he has not submitted any documentation to confirm that he has actually made 
the down payment or the scheduled $200 payment for August 15, 2014.40 Nevertheless, 
it appears that the account is in the process of being resolved. 
The third category of accounts alleged in the SOR - those for which repayment 
plans and settlements have been discussed, but which payments have not yet 
commenced, consists of only one account. There is permanent change of station (PCS) 
separation travel claim overpayment of $434.40 for travel done when Applicant was 
discharged in 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.b.) that was charged off in the amount of $445.41 Applicant

company that buys "accounts receivable" from a current creditor and then collects on those receivables from the 
debtor. A factored account is not supposed to be an account that is delinquent or charged off.

contended that the original balance was $4,434, and that he had paid it down to the 
current amount, and was under the erroneous impression that the entire balance had 
been paid.42 Applicant has offered two inconsistent explanations as to what has 
transpired regarding the account. In November 2013, he told the OPM investigator that 
he was in a repayment plan under which he paid the balance off in six months in 2010.43 
During the hearing, he claimed he had contacted DFAS in an effort to establish a 
repayment plan, but his efforts were rejected.44 He indicated that when he receives his 
first check from his new employer, he will pay either half or the entire balance.45 Once 
his initial payment is confirmed, the status of the account will transition to being in the 
process of being resolved.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s deputy director of engineering from his former employer, the product 
director from the service program executive office, and Applicant’s civilian and military 
colleagues, are effusive in support of Applicant’s application for a security clearance. He 
has been characterized as trustworthy, dedicated, loyal, highly professional, well 
respected by his peers, a proactive member of the community, dependable, reliable, 
and respectful of privacy, classified information, rules and restrictions.46 Applicant’s ex-
wife supports his application.47 Applicant’s father has urged him to resolve the financial 
issues as quickly as possible, and endorses Applicant in every way possible for 
increased levels of security clearance. He also suggested granting Applicant a 
clearance on a conditional basis, or as he referred to it, as a probationary period to 
evaluate Applicant’s willingness to manage his arrearages.48 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although he encountered some financial difficulties as early as 2007, 
Applicant’s most significant financial problems arose in 2010, and continued for several 
years thereafter. He was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments, and 
various accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged 
off. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are

clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.55  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties initially 
since 2007, but reappearing in 2010 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long 
ago” or “was so infrequent.” While there is some evidence of poor investments in the 
stock market and mismanaged money, Applicant’s financial problems were not caused 
by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, 
his financial problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. Because of his many 
deployments, his marriage collapsed. Maintaining two households, assisting his wife to 
relocate to her home country, and repeated periods of unemployment, merely 
exacerbated his financial problems.  
When he obtained new employment in 2007, and went on additional 
deployments as a civilian contractor to Iraq and Afghanistan, during 2008 and 2009, he 
was able to resolve a significant number of delinquent accounts by making between 
$5,000 and $6,000 in payments. In 2010 and 2011, he was faced with additional periods 
of unemployment. Each time he started making a regular salary Applicant approached 
his creditors in an effort to set up repayment arrangements. Applicant’s overall 
repayment strategy has been successful, and he has resolved, in addition to the 
numerous non-SOR accounts, five of the accounts alleged in the SOR. He is also in the 
process of resolving two other SOR-related accounts that are currently in repayment 
plans. There is one remaining SOR-related account which he erroneously thought he 
had resolved, but which he now intends to resolve with one or two payments, depending 
on his ability to do so.  
He received counseling from a financial counselor at his church, and she guided 
him on how to pay some of his accounts and how to reduce his debt. All of Applicant’s 
newer accounts are current. A review of his personal financial statement reveals that he 
now has approximately $1,571.90 each month available for discretionary spending or 
savings. Applicant acted responsibly by addressing all of his delinquent accounts, and

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

working with his creditors.56 With his current job, there are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.57 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.58       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. He also made some 
poor investments in the stock market, and some of the money he had saved was 
mismanaged. As a result, in 2007, and again in 2010, various accounts became 
delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. One account, the DFAS 
overpayment, has been unresolved since 2007. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. He 
has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. Applicant’s financial problems were not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Rather, his problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. He was a decorated 
member of the U.S. Navy who, in a ten-year period, participated in 14 deployments, and 
subsequently as a civilian contractor, participated in additional deployments to Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Deployments wrecked his marriage. Repeated periodic unemployment and 
the expenses of maintaining two separate households, in addition to his divorce, left him 
with insufficient funds to maintain his monthly payments. However, Applicant did not 
ignore his debts. Instead, whenever he gained regular employment, he addressed 
whatever delinquent debts he could. In 2008 and 2009, he was able to resolve a 
significant number of delinquent accounts. Applicant set up repayment arrangements. In 
addition to the numerous non-SOR accounts, Applicant has resolved, or is in the 
process of resolving, all but one of the accounts identified in the SOR. As for that one 
remaining account, he intends to resolve with one or two payments, depending on his 
ability to do so. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:59 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.60 Overall, the evidence

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
 
13 
                                      
 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
