LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on May 22, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2014. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 24, 
2014, scheduling the hearing for August 12, 2014. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 4 through 6 were admitted in evidence 
 
2 
 
without objection. GE 2 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. The objection to GE 3 
was sustained. Applicant testified, but he did not submit any documentary evidence.  
The record was held open until August 26, 2014, for Applicant to submit additional 
information. He submitted documents that were marked Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
August 21, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer, but at different locations, since March 2010. He transferred to his 
current location in August 2013. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. 
He is a high school graduate, and he attended a technical school from August 2007 
through March 2009. He is single but engaged to be married. He does not have any 
children.1 
 
 The SOR alleges a delinquent $529 medical account (SOR ¶ 1.a); five past-due 
student loans with balances totaling $37,824 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b–1.f); and a collection account 
for $4,602 (SOR ¶ 1.g). All of the debts appear on at least one credit report. Applicant 
denied owing the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, stating he did not recognize the creditor. 
He admitted owing the remaining debts.  
 
 Applicant was unemployed from March 2009 until he was hired by his current 
employer in March 2010. The training and education he received in technical school 
made him eligible to work for his employer. His student loans were deferred while he 
was unemployed. He stated that an official at the technical school was arrested for 
taking student loans out in students’ names and embezzling the money. The official’s 
actions may have affected him, but Applicant also admits that he borrowed about 
$32,000, consisting of the five student loans alleged in the SOR. Four of the loans have 
been consolidated into one loan for payment purposes.2  
 
 Applicant did not pay what was owed every month on his student loans, but he 
stated that he paid what he could. He testified that he paid about $3,000 toward his 
student loans. He incurred expenses when he transferred to his current location in 
August 2013 in order to be closer to his ill mother. He listed his delinquent student loans 
on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he submitted in 
August 2013, and he fully discussed them during his background interview in 
September 2013. He told the interviewer that he would begin paying the student loans 
on a regular basis. Applicant is getting married in a few weeks. The wedding expenses 
made it difficult to pay the student loans. He also indicated that his overtime hours have 
been cut.3

 April 7, 2014   $100   Single loan 
 April 8, 2014   $150   Consolidated loans 
 
Total:    $2,752.084 
 
Only $192.74 of the above payments went to the principal on the loans; the remainder 
went to interest on the loans. The current balance due on the four consolidated student 
loans is $19,635, which includes $1,412 owed in interest. The balance due on the 
individual loan was not provided.5 
 
 Applicant testified that he paid the $529 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a the 
day before the hearing.6 His testimony on that debt is accepted.  
 
 Applicant denied owing the $4,602 collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. He 
stated that he did not recognize the creditor. The debt is listed by Equifax and Experian 
on the combined credit report from September 2013. It lists the date of last action as

October 2007. The debt is not listed on the Equifax credit reports obtained in February 
2014 and August 2014.7  
 
 Applicant stated that he made arrangements to start paying a set amount 
towards his student loans after his wedding. He has a good job, and he will be able to 
pay the monthly amount. He earned about $68,000 in 2013. He also stated that if he 
receives a security clearance, he will be eligible for a higher-paying job, and he will use 
the additional funds to pay the student loans. He is current on his other bills, including 
the $627 monthly payments on a $31,274 car loan that was incurred in August 2012. 
His SF 86 indicates that he visited foreign countries for tourism in May 2012 and again 
in November 2012. He has not received financial counseling.8  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
                                                          
7 Tr. at 35-36, 45-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-6. 
 
8 Tr. at 22-23, 29-33, 43-44, 49; GE 4-6.

the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts, and he was unable or 
unwilling to pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant paid the $529 medical account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a the day before 
the hearing. He disputed owing the $4,602 collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, and 
the debt is not listed on the two most recent credit reports. AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(e) are 
applicable to those debts. 
 
 Applicant was unemployed from March 2009 until he was hired by his current 
employer in March 2010. He transferred in 2013 to be closer to his ill mother. Those 
events were beyond his control. His wedding expenses are not beyond his control. 
 
 Applicant has been steadily employed since March 2010 in a good job that he 
was qualified for because he attended technical school. He has paid $2,752 toward his 
student loans. Since December 2013, he has paid a total of $250, and nothing since 
April 2014. It is difficult to accept that he could not have paid more towards his student 
loans when he vacationed in foreign countries twice in 2012 and he is paying $627 each 
month on a $31,274 car loan. Applicant stated that he will resume paying his student 
loans in September 2014. The Appeal Board has held that “intentions to pay off debts in 
the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible 
approaches.” See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 08-08440 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009)).  
 
 There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his 
debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are no mitigating 
conditions applicable to Applicant’s student loans.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
7 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been steadily 
employed in a good job for more than four years, but he has done little to address the 
student loans that made it possible for him to earn his education and obtain his job. 
Because of interest, he owes more now than when he obtained the loans. His conduct 
raises doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.f:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
