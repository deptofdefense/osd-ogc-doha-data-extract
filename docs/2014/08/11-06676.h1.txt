LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On April 23, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 Applicant responded to the SOR on May 16, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2014. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 24, 
2014, scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2014. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without 
 
2 
 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through G, which 
were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 
21, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since August 2010. He served in the U.S. military from 1988 until 
he was honorably discharged in 1991. He is applying for a security clearance. He 
attended college for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He is divorced with two 
adult children.1 
 
 The SOR alleges an unpaid $11,333 judgment (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a federal tax lien 
of $5,391 for unpaid taxes (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant indicated that he paid the back taxes 
and he has been paying the judgment.  
 
 Applicant was self-employed as a contractor in the home construction industry 
from 1996 until he was hired by his current employer in 2010. He did not pay all his 
federal income taxes when they were due. His business severely declined during the 
housing crisis and never recovered. He was unable to pay all his bills, and several debts 
became delinquent.2 
 
 Applicant listed his unpaid taxes and the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a on 
his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he submitted in 
October 2010, and he discussed them during his background interview in November 
2010. He told the interviewer that he did not have the money to pay the taxes and the 
judgment at that time because of his lack of work due to the downturn in the housing 
market. He stated that he intended to pay the debts.3 
 
 The IRS filed a $5,391 tax lien against Applicant in 2009 for unpaid taxes for 
every tax year from 1999 to 2006. Applicant also owed for tax year 2007. Applicant paid 
the taxes through payments and by the IRS withholding refunds. His 2010 income tax 
refund was withheld to pay his 2001 taxes and part of his 2002 taxes. In July 2011, 
Applicant paid the $1,285 tax bill for 2007 with a loan from his girlfriend. In March 2013, 
the IRS withheld $1,524 from Applicant’s refund for tax year 2012 to pay most of the 
taxes due for tax year 2003. Applicant paid the remaining $57 owed for tax year 2003 in 
March 2013. The final payment of $2,955 was made to the IRS on May 5, 2014, again 
with a loan from Applicant’s girlfriend. The IRS released the lien indicating that Applicant 
“has satisfied the taxes listed below and all statutory additions.”4

 The creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a obtained a judgment against Applicant in 
February 2009. The judgment is accumulating interest. The credit reports all show a 
judgment of $11,333. In August 2012, the creditor showed a total due of $16,425. It is 
likely that the judgment was for $11,333, and $16,425 was the amount due with interest. 
Applicant has been paying the judgment for more than two years. In 2012, Applicant 
agreed to pay $400 per month until the judgment was satisfied. He has been unable to 
maintain that schedule. He has stayed in contact with the creditor, who has accepted 
the payments that Applicant was able to make.5 Applicant documented the following 
payments: 
 
  DATE    PAYMENT 
 
  July 23, 2012  $2,000 
  July 30, 2012  $100 
  August 3, 2012  $100  
  August 6, 2012  $200  
  August 17, 2012  $100

  October 15, 2012  $100 
  October 31 2012  $100 
  December 19, 2012  $200 
  May 31, 2013  $400 
  June 22, 2013  $200

  August 23, 2013  $300 
  October 9, 2013  $500 
  October 21, 2013  $300 
  January 15, 2014  $400 
  June 26, 2014  $100 
  August 5, 2014  $2006 
 
  TOTAL:   $6,900 
 
 Applicant paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. His mother had 
health problems that prevented him from paying more toward the judgment in 2014. He 
was also dealing with his tax problems. He estimated that he still owes about $10,000 
toward the judgment. He stated that with his tax problems resolved, he is better able to

address the judgment. He credibly testified that he will continue with the payments until 
the judgment is satisfied. He has not received financial counseling.7 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts, and he was unable or unwilling to pay 
his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.

 Applicant was self-employed in the housing industry. His business suffered when 
the housing market collapsed. Those events were beyond his control. His tax issues 
were not beyond his control. 
 
 Applicant has worked for his current employer since August 2010. He has been 
working on his financial problems for several years. He paid debts that were not alleged 
in the SOR. His taxes were paid through a combination of payments and the IRS 
withholding his refunds. The final payment was made in May 2014. He has been 
steadily paying the judgment for more than two years. He documented $6,900 in 
payments. He estimated that he still owes about $10,000. With his tax problems 
resolved, he is better able to address the judgment. He credibly testified that he will 
continue with the payments until the judgment is satisfied. 
 
 A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as 
a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant 
need only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions 
to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 I find that Applicant made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. There are clear 
indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. They 
occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are 
applicable. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) are partially applicable. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
7 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
I considered Applicant’s honorable military service, the factors that led to his 
financial problems, and his credible testimony that he will continue to pay the judgment. 
As indicated above, an applicant is not required to establish that he has paid every debt 
listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant establish a plan to resolve the 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. I find that 
Applicant has established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he has taken 
significant action to implement that plan.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
