HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 17 delinquent, collection or 
charged-off accounts totaling $191,530. She failed to provide sufficient documentation 
of progress resolving her financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 30, 2007, and May 17, 2011, Applicant submitted Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) versions of security clearance 
applications (SF 86). (Items 5, 6) On February 27, 2014, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant

or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On April 10, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (Item 3) On April 
16, 2014, Applicant sent an email to Department Counsel, indicating she waived her 
right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated May 28, 2014, was provided to her on June 3, 2014.1 Applicant did not respond to 
the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 11, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a-1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.q.3 She denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.i, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.p. She also provided some extenuating and mitigating information. 
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old systems administrator, who has worked for the same 
defense contractor since 2011.4 In 1998, she graduated with a general diploma from 
high school. In 2000, Applicant married. Her twin children were born in 2004. Applicant 
has never served in the military. Applicant’s husband is on active duty in the Air Force. 
(Item 3 at 16) There is no evidence of security violations, criminal conduct, use of illegal 
drugs, or alcohol abuse. She disclosed her financial problems on her 2011 SF 86. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 17 delinquent, collection or charged-off accounts 
totaling $191,530 as follows: (1)-(3) charged-off bank debts in ¶¶ 1.a ($518), 1.b ($459), 
and 1.c ($397); (4) telecommunications collection account in ¶ 1.d ($696); (5) student 
loan collection account in ¶ 1.e ($4,984); (6)-(7) bank collection accounts in ¶¶ 1.f

Applicant cited her unemployment as the cause of her financial problems. (Item 
3) She was unemployed from March 2002 to October 2006, from April 2010 to October 
2010, and from March 2011 to June 2011. (Item 7 at 22-23) Her October 19, 2013 
personal financial statement (PFS) states she was unemployed when she completed 
her PFS; however, it does not provide the period of unemployment. (Item 7 at 12) 
 
On June 12, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant about her finances. (Item 8) Applicant said she was “contacting 
her creditors to take care of her debts.” (Item 8) She discussed six delinquent debts 
shown on her credit report, including a substantial student loan debt. (Item 8) On August 
23, 2011, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant about her finances. (Item 7 at 24-
27) She discussed most of the debts listed in the SOR with the OPM investigator.   
 
On January 30, 2014, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($459) wrote that if 
Applicant paid $276 over a 12-month period, the debt would be resolved. (Item 3 at 10) 
The creditor noted the debt was charged off on January 29, 2010. (Item 3 at 10) 
Applicant said she planned to pay the creditor $23 monthly. (Item 3 at 10) She did not 
provide proof of any payments. 
 
On January 29, 2014, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($397) wrote that if 
Applicant paid $280 over a 10-month period, the debt would be resolved. (Item 3 at 11) 
The creditor noted the debt was charged off on January 29, 2010. (Item 3 at 11) 
Applicant said she planned to pay the creditor $28 monthly. (Item 3 at 10) She did not 
provide proof of any payments. 
 
On January 30, 2014, the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,984) wrote that 
Applicant had contacted the creditor and was seeking to bring her student loan from 
default status to rehabilitation status. (Item 3 at 12) The loan balance was now $6,283, 
and nine timely payments over a 10-month period were required to bring the account to 
current status. (Item 3 at 13-14) She did not provide proof of any payments. 
 
In 2007, Applicant and her husband purchased a residence for $179,000 and 
financed the purchase with a loan from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).5 (Item 
                                            
5The VA loan guarantee is as follows: “For loans between $45,000 and $144,000, the minimum 
guaranty amount is $22,500, with a maximum guaranty, of up to 40 percent of the loan up to $36,000, 
subject to the amount of entitlement a veteran has available.” As to whether the VA loss on a loan must 
be repaid, the VA explains:   
 
Must the loan be repaid? 
 
Yes. A VA guaranteed loan is not a gift. It must be repaid, just as you must repay any 
money you borrow. The VA guaranty, which protects the lender against loss, encourages 
the lender to make a loan with terms favorable to the veteran. But if you fail to make the 
payments you agreed to make, you may lose your home through foreclosure, and you 
and your family would probably lose all the time and money you had invested in it. If the 
lender does take a loss, VA must pay the guaranty to the lender, and the amount paid by 
VA must be repaid by you. If your loan closed on or after January 1, 1990, you will owe

3 at 23-24) In February 2013, they were four years behind on their mortgage. (Item 3 at 
23-24) Their monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance totaled 
$1,452. (Item 3 at 23-24) Applicant wrote the creditor about the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k (past-
due mortgage amount $78,489; mortgage amount: $176,259).6 Her letter said she 
became unemployed and was unable to make the payments on her mortgage. She and 
her husband attempted to sell the property for three years; however, the market value of 
the property had decreased and was less than the amount of her mortgage. The 
mortgage creditor lost the documentation several times and failed to respond in a timely 
manner to an offer to purchase the property in 2012-2013.7 (Item 3 at 22) In 2013, 
Applicant moved to a different state because her husband had military orders. (Item 3 at 
16) She provided an October 21, 2013 quitclaim deed to the mortgage creditor. (Item 3 
at 19-20) She offered to provide a deed in lieu of foreclosure; however, she wanted the 
creditor to inform the credit bureaus that the debt was resolved “as a satisfied paid 
settlement” and to ask the credit bureaus to remove any negative remarks from her 
credit report. She did not indicate that she was offering to pay any cash to the creditor to 
accept the quitclaim deed. On December 11, 2013, the creditor wrote Applicant that her 
“loan is currently being reviewed for Deed in Lieu.” (Item 3 at 21) As of April 2014, the 
property was not foreclosed, and she was waiting for an answer to her latest attempt to 
resolve the debt. (Item 3 at 3-4)       
 
Applicant said she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($759), and she provided a March 
12, 2014 letter from the creditor indicating the debt was paid. (Item 3 at 9) The creditor 
stated the credit bureau would be informed of the payment. (Item 3 at 9)  
 
Applicant denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($849), 1.l ($488), 1.n 
($370), and 1.p ($529). (Item 3) She said she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($1,252) in 
2003. (Item 3) Her May 1, 2014 credit report includes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l, but not the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q. (Item 9) Her October 10, 2013 credit report 
includes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, but not the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q. (Item 
10) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.q are not in Applicant’s August 26, 2013 credit report. 
(Item 11) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.q is in Applicant’s June 7, 2011 credit report. (Item 12) 
 
Applicant’s October 19, 2013 PFS shows the following monthly amounts: 
spouse’s net salary of $4,400; Applicant’s unemployment compensation of $1,544; 
monthly expenses of $4,065; debt payments of $1,700; and a net remainder of $179. 
                                                                                                                                            
the Government in the event of a default only if there was fraud, misrepresentation, or 
bad faith on your part.

(Item 7 at 12) Debt payments include $1,200 for two car payments. In 2012, Applicant 
and her spouse purchased two vehicles and owe $46,000 to creditors. (Item 7 at 12) 
The two vehicle loans are current.  
 
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of corroborating documentation and other 
mitigating information and explained that Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the 
FORM “in which to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, 
extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate.” (FORM at 5-6) She did not 
respond to the FORM.               
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports and SOR response. She had delinquent debts seven years ago when an 
OPM investigator interviewed her. Her mortgage became delinquent four years ago. 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;8 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
                                            
8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all debts. Applicant did not act responsibly 
under the circumstances. She did not provide sufficient information about her finances 
to establish her inability to make greater progress paying her creditors. Applicant’s 
unemployment damaged her finances and is a circumstance largely beyond her control; 
however, she did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She did not establish 
how long she was unemployed during the last two years or the amount of her income. 
She presented insufficient evidence about what she did over the last two years to pay 
her SOR debts.     
 
 In January 2014, Applicant received correspondence from the creditors for the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($459), 1.c ($397), and 1.e ($4,984), suggesting payment plans 
which would have brought the three debts into current status. In April 2014, she said 
these three debts were in payment plans. On May 28, 2014, the FORM suggested 
these three debts were not mitigated due to lack of evidence of any payments to the 
three creditors. Applicant did not submit proof of payments to the three creditors. 
Applicant did not establish the three debts are current, and they are not mitigated.       
 
Applicant denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($849), 1.l ($488), 1.n 
($370), and 1.p ($529). She said she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($1,252) in 2003. Her 
May 1, 2014; October 10, 2013; August 26, 2013, and June 7, 2011 credit reports 
include inconsistent descriptions of her financial responsibility for these four debts. The 
five debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q are not established, and they are mitigated. 
 
Applicant admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($759). She explained that she paid it, 
and she provided corroborating evidence establishing payment. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o 
is mitigated. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a past-due mortgage amount of $78,489 and a mortgage 
amount of $176,259 for a total liability of $254,748. The VA guarantee is $36,000, and 
veterans “usually have no liability to the government following a foreclosure, except in 
cases involving fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith, such as allowing an unapproved 
assumption” of responsibility to repay the loan.9 In this situation, Applicant’s debt to the 
creditor may be about $218,748 ($254,748 minus $36,000 which would be paid by the

the VA loan guarantee is from the Veterans Administration website, Office of Public and

VA) subject to a credit for the amount received based on the sale of the property. She 
may also owe state property taxes on this house and legal fees relating to the property’s 
sale. At some point, the creditor might accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in that 
event, Applicant would be released from financial liability on her mortgage debt.  The 
current state of the evidence is that Applicant has a substantial unresolved liability 
relating to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k.   
 
Applicant did not provide any of the following documentation relating to the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.f-1.h, 1.j, and 1.m: (1) proof of payments such as 
checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor 
proving that she paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) correspondence to or 
from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact with the creditor;10 (3) a credible 
debt dispute; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement offers or 
agreements to show that she was attempting to resolve these seven debts; (5) evidence 
of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence of progress or resolution of these seven 
SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not occur in the future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
                                            
10 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 34-year-old systems administrator, who has worked for the same defense 
contractor since 2011. In 2000, she married. She has two children, who are 10 years 
old. She has never served in the military. Her unemployment damaged her finances. 
There is no evidence of security violations, criminal conduct, use of illegal drugs, or 
alcohol abuse. She contributes to her company and the DOD. These factors are 
indications of her reliability and trustworthiness.   
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Her mortgage has 
been delinquent for four years. She was well aware of her financial problems, as she 
received notice of them when OPM investigators interviewed her in 2007 and again in 
2011. She provided proof that she paid only one SOR debt in 2014. She established 
that she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($759). She did not provide proof that she made 
any payments to any other SOR creditors in 2014. She denied responsibility for four 
other debts; said she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q; and she is credited with mitigating 
them. She could have made greater progress resolving and documenting resolution of 
more of her SOR debts. Her failure to provide more corroborating documentation shows 
lack of financial responsibility and lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions 
about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. 
See AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security 
concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
