HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges nine delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off debts, totaling $253,108. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
progress resolving her financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 24, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of her security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 5) On August 13, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On September 12, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived 
her right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated October 28, 2013, was provided to her on November 5, 2013.1 Applicant did not 
respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Item 4) 
She did not provide any documentation from creditors, disputes, or other evidence of 
payments as part of her SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 38 years old, and she has worked as an administrative assistant for 
a defense contractor since October 2011.3 In 1995, she married, and in 2000, she was 
divorced. She shared a house with her former spouse after her divorce. Her children 
were born in 1994 and 1998. She has never served on active duty. In 2004, she was 
awarded an associate’s degree. She attended college from September 2010 to May 
2011 as a part-time student. (Item 7) 
 
Applicant was unemployed from April 2009 to September 2010 and from July 
2007 to August 2007. (Item 7) She was an administrative assistant from September 
2010 to October 2011; she was an administrative sales assistant from October 2006 to 
March 2009; and she was a floor manager from September 2005 to October 2006. 
There is no evidence of criminal arrests or convictions or use of illegal drugs or alcohol 
abuse.  
 
When Applicant completed her October 24, 2011 SF 86, she disclosed ten 
delinquent debts that became delinquent in 2006.  Her three largest debts were two 
mortgage debts from a foreclosure and a $24,116 charged-off, vehicle-related debt from 
2006. For most of her debts, she indicated, “getting job to pay debt.”   
 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 29, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated 
November 5, 2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after her receipt 
to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s October 24, 2011 SF 86 
and/or her November 21, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) 
are the primary sources for the facts in the Statement of Facts. (Items 5, 7) 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant’s 
October 24, 2011 SF 86. (Item 5)

Applicant’s SOR and credit bureau reports, dated November 1, 2011; February 
21, 2013; and July 3, 2013, describe nine delinquent, collection, or charged-off debts, 
totaling $253,108 as follows: (1) ¶ 1.a is a mortgage account foreclosed in October 
2006 ($203,620); (2) ¶ 1.b is a telecommunications collection account ($412); (3) ¶ 1.c 
is a collection account ($499); (4) ¶ 1.d is a collection account ($1,148); (5) ¶ 1.e is a 
telecommunications collection account ($482); (6) ¶ 1.f is a vehicle collections account 
($7,584); (7) ¶ 1.g is a mortgage account foreclosed in October 2006 ($39,042); (8) ¶ 
1.h is a telecommunications collection account ($236); and (9) ¶ 1.i is a book club 
collection account ($85).  
 
In September 2005, Applicant and her former husband moved into a home 
together. (Item 5) Her first mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a) was for $204,000, and the second 
mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.g) was for $51,000.  (Item 10) Her monthly house payment was 
about $1,600. (Item 7) In October 2006, Applicant’s former husband moved out. (Item 7) 
He did not assist her with her house payments after moving out, and her home went into 
foreclosure in September or October 2006.  (Item 7) 
 
Applicant said the vehicle collection account ($7,584) in SOR ¶ 1.f resulted from 
a vehicle loan that she and her former husband co-signed. (Item 7) The $7,585 was the 
amount remaining after the vehicle was repossessed and sold. She believed it was her 
former spouse’s responsibility to pay this debt. (Item 7) The vehicle loan became 
delinquent in October 2006. (Items 9, 10) 
 
Applicant did not make any payments to any of her SOR creditors. On November 
21, 2011, she advised the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that she 
was contemplating filing to have her debts discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code in February 2012. (Item 7) She said she would pay the $85 book club 
debt in 2012. (Item 7) On January 10, 2013, Appellant signed a retainer agreement with 
her bankruptcy attorney. (Item 7) In response to DOHA interrogatories she said that she 
planned to file for bankruptcy in March 2013. (Item 7) On March 5, 2013, Applicant 
completed the necessary counseling to file for bankruptcy. (Item 7) On September 30, 
2013, DOHA utilized Pacer to check for Applicant’s bankruptcy filing and was not able to 
locate any documentation. (Item 11) Applicant did not provide a personal financial 
statement (PFS) or detailed income, expense, and budget information.   
 
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of mitigating information and explained that 
Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary 
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as 
appropriate.” (FORM at 8) She did not respond to the FORM or update the status of her 
bankruptcy.               
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or her designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, OPM personal subject interview (PSI), responses to DOHA 
interrogatories, and SOR response. Applicant’s file documents nine delinquent, 
collection, or charged-off debts, totaling $253,108. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. Applicant and her former spouse were living in a house 
together, and he moved out and stopped paying a share of the mortgages.  A vehicle 
was repossessed.  She was unemployed from April 2009 to September 2010 and July 
2007 to August 2007. These are financial conditions largely beyond her control; 
however, she did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide 
sufficient information about her unemployment or changes in her income over the last 
five years to mitigate financial concerns. She did not establish her inability to make 
greater progress paying her creditors. She failed to explain the failure to provide 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

corroborating documentation of such efforts to DOHA. Applicant received financial 
counseling in connection with her Chapter 7 bankruptcy, however, she did not establish 
that there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. 
 
In sum, Applicant did not provide any documentation, such as checking account 
statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that she paid or 
made any payments to any of the nine SOR creditors. There is no financial 
documentation relating to these nine SOR creditors showing: maintenance of contact 
with creditors;5 correspondence to or from the SOR creditors; credible debt disputes; 
attempts to negotiate payment plans; or other evidence of progress or resolution of 
these nine SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are 
being resolved, are under control, and will not occur in the future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant’s 
finances were adversely affected when she was unemployed and when her former 
spouse failed to take greater responsibility for their debts. These two occurrences 
resulted in negative financial conditions largely beyond her control. There is no 
evidence of criminal conduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. She contributes to her 
                                            
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside her [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether she or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that she 
would intentionally violate national security.   
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Several debts on 
her SOR became delinquent more than six years ago. She was well aware of her 
financial problems, as she disclosed them on her October 24, 2011 SF 86 and on her 
November 21, 2011 OPM PSI. She did not provide documentary proof that she 
attempted to settle or make any payments to resolve any of her nine delinquent SOR 
debts, even though five of her SOR debts were less than $500, and one was less than 
$100. She could have made greater progress resolving and documenting resolution of 
her delinquent SOR debts. She failed to mitigate nine delinquent, collection, or charged-
off debts, totaling $253,108. Applicant’s SOR response admitted responsibility for her 
SOR debts, and she indicated in response to DOHA interrogatories that she planned to 
file for bankruptcy in March 2013; however, she did not provide any proof that she had 
filed for bankruptcy. Not everyone who files for bankruptcy is able to successfully 
discharge their nonpriority unsecured debts. Her failure to establish her financial 
responsibility shows lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See 
AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security 
concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
