decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.
On November 12, 2013, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge considered all of the
evidence.  Consistent with the following, we remand the case to the Judge.
Applicant has presented matters from outside the record, the gist of which is that he was
notified by Department Counsel after the decision was issued that the Judge had not reviewed
evidence Applicant submitted after the hearing.1  As a general rule, we cannot consider new
evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  However, in the past we have considered new evidence
insofar as it raises questions of due process or jurisdiction.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  12-01038
(App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2013).  We conclude that the best resolution of this matter is to remand the case
to the Judge for further processing.  
Order
The case is REMANDED.
