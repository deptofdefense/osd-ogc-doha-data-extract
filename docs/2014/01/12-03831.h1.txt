GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 3, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On March 19, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on May 21, 
2013.2 On July 9, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all

adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 
1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on July 19, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
August 29, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on October 15, 2013. The case was assigned to me on October 
21, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on December 3, 2013, and I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on December 18, 2013.3 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 
2, 2014. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took 
advantage of that opportunity. He submitted 19 additional documents, which were 
marked as exhibits (AE J through AE AB), and admitted into evidence without objection. 
The record closed on January 2, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.l., and 1.m.). He denied or 
failed to address the remaining factual allegations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since March 
2009, has served as a full-time technical trainer. He is also a part-time member of the 
U.S. Army National Guard (ANG), and was previously employed by other employers in 
various positions, including welder, security officer, delivery person, and wing fabricator. 
He currently holds a secret security clearance.4 A May 2003 high school graduate, 
Applicant completed some community college and university courses, but he has not 
received a degree. He married his first wife in September 2005, they separated in 2007, 
and were divorced in January 2011. He married his second wife in October 2012, they

 The Directive established that notification as to the time and place of a hearing be furnished to an applicant 
at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, Department 
Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the actual Notice of 
Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and the hearing was less 
than 15 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant specifically waived the 15-day 
notice requirement. See, Tr. at 13-14.

separated in 2013, and are in the process of divorcing.5 Applicant has a daughter, born 
in 2007, and his wife is currently pregnant.6 
 
Military and Civilian Service 
 
 Applicant enlisted in the ANG in March 2002, and was subsequently ordered to 
active duty on two occasions (September 2003 to December 2003, and August 2005 to 
June 2007) and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.7 During his 
military service, Applicant was awarded the Army Service Ribbon, the Army 
Achievement Medal (two awards), the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal, the Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development 
Ribbon, and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal (with M device).8 In addition, in his 
civilian capacity, Applicant was deployed to both Afghanistan (August 2010 to May 
2011) and Iraq (May 2011 to November 2011).9 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about his finances until about 2006 or 2007, when 
Applicant was deployed. He had given his wife a power of attorney and she was 
expected to manage the family finances while he was away. Instead, she opened new 
accounts and failed to pay the incoming bills.10 As a result, some accounts became past 
due or were placed for collection.11 In 2009, Applicant hired an attorney to assist him in 
his efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts by dealing with his creditors and setting up 
repayment plans. Those efforts ceased when Applicant went overseas for his employer. 
He started making his extra overseas salary and felt he could pay off the entire 
balances owed rather than making partial payments under repayment plans.12 
Applicant’s father agreed to assist him to resolve the fiscal mess with Applicant’s extra 
overseas salary, but that plan soon fell apart.  
In 2010, over a six-week period, Applicant’s parents, brother, and brother-in-law 
all were laid off. As a result, Applicant supported his parents, brother, sister, brother-in-
law, and his sister’s two children. In addition, when his sister filed for divorce, Applicant 
paid for it. Applicant put food on the table, made the house payments, utility payments,

insurance payments, and car payments for everybody over a seven-month period.13 The 
financial assistance Applicant expended on behalf of his family was overwhelming and 
resulted in a shortage of available funds, and an inability to address his own accounts. 
As a result, more accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or 
charged off. One account went to judgment. In addition, when Applicant’s divorce 
process commenced, he was finally made aware of the full extent of his financial 
problems when his creditors were identified.14  
On an unspecified, but more recent, date, Applicant hired another attorney to 
assist him in his efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts by dealing with his creditors 
and setting up repayment plans, but that attorney’s fees were simply too high for 
Applicant to afford.15 Applicant also received some informal financial guidance from his 
father regarding obtaining a credit report and contacting his creditors. In addition, 
Applicant has now received formal financial counseling from the financial readiness 
program manager at his local military facility.16 Applicant has contacted all of his 
creditors, and has either already paid off or otherwise resolved some accounts, entered 
into repayment arrangements and is making scheduled payments on other accounts, 
and disputed other accounts. He started with his oldest debts and started moving 
towards his newer debts. He is also willing to start payment arrangements with his 
remaining creditors, as soon as he receives an amount and repayment schedule.17 
In December 2013, Applicant provided a personal financial statement reflecting 
some rather garbled financial information. It was a revised version of a personal 
financial statement he had previously submitted in response to the interrogatories in 
May 2013. It depicted a monthly net income of $5,212.04; monthly household, utility, 
transportation, food expenses, and monthly debt repayments of $4,667.30; leaving a 
monthly remainder of $544.74 available for discretionary savings or expenditures.18 It is 
unclear if several of the items listed are accurate or duplicate entries. The more recent 
personal financial statement also listed $39,561.64 in stocks and bonds. 
The SOR identified 20 purportedly continuing delinquencies. Among those 
accounts that he either already paid off or otherwise resolved, or entered into 
repayment arrangements and is making scheduled payments, are the following:

There was a cable television account with an unpaid balance of $533 that was 
placed for collection and sold or transferred to collection agent in 2013 (SOR & 1.b.).19 
Applicant had closed the account but neglected to return the cable equipment and still 
had a small unpaid balance. He eventually returned the equipment and paid $196.86.20 
Applicant received a letter from the collection agent, on behalf of the original creditor, 
indicating that there was now a zero balance on the account, and that the account 
would be removed from the credit reports.21 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a secured credit card account with a high credit of $5,000 and an unpaid 
balance of $302, of which $73 was past due, that was placed for collection in 2013 
(SOR & 1.e.).22 When the account was closed it still had a small balance, but Applicant 
was not receiving any information or correspondence regarding the account because he 
had moved and the notices were sent to his old residence. He called the creditor and 
learned of the outstanding balance, and quickly agreed to a repayment plan under 
which he agreed to pay the creditor $25 per month until it is paid off.23 Applicant has not 
submitted any documentation to support his contention that he is in a repayment plan or 
that he has been making the monthly payments. Nevertheless, it appears that the 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
There was a credit card account with a credit limit of $2,200 and an unspecified 
past-due balance that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt buyer 
(SOR & 1.f.).24 Once he returned from overseas, he entered into a repayment plan, and 
his final payment came out of his salary check in July 2012.25 There is now a zero 
balance.26 The account has been resolved. 
 
There was a utility account with a past-due balance of $87 that was placed for 
collection in 2007 (SOR & 1.i.).27 Applicant contended that when he moved from one 
state to another, there apparently was a small remaining balance about which he was 
unaware, because he paid his apartment complex for his utilities.28 He made

6, 2014.29 Applicant has not submitted any documentation to support his contention that 
he has made the agreed payment. Nevertheless, it appears that the account has been 
resolved. 
 
There was a personal loan account with a high credit and past-due balance of 
$426 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2007 (SOR & 1.k.).30 Applicant 
and his first wife each had an account with the creditor, and he paid one off, thinking he 
had also paid off the remaining account as well. While Applicant was overseas, his 
father received a telephone call from the creditor regarding the remaining account, and 
the account was paid off in November 2011.31 The creditor has acknowledged that the 
account had been paid in full.32 The account has been resolved. 
 
There was a wireless telephone account with a high credit and past-due balance 
of $1,130 that was placed for collection in 2007 (SOR & 1.n).33 When Applicant returned 
from one of his military deployments, he was unable to find a decent-paying position. 
With mounting bills, he made several efforts to reduce his expenses, but he decided to 
cancel the account, leaving a small balance unpaid.34 Applicant eventually paid the 
collection agent $1,130.78 in November 2011. The creditor has acknowledged that the 
account had been paid in full.35 The account has been resolved. 
 
There was a cable television account with a high credit and past-due balance of 
$888 that was placed for collection and sold or transferred to collection agent in 2007 
(SOR & 1.o.).36 The original creditor was apparently sold to another company. Applicant 
contended he closed the account but neglected to return the cable equipment. He 
eventually returned two digital converter boxes and was credited with $560.00. The 
account was considered satisfied.37 The account has been resolved. 
  
There was an account with a jewelry store with a high credit of $605 that was 
placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser in 2011 (SOR & 1.p.).38 Applicant

eventually paid a third-party collection agent an agreed payoff amount of $272.23 in 
November 2011, over a year and one-half before the SOR was issued. The creditor has 
acknowledged that the account had been paid in full.39 The account has been resolved. 
 
There was an electric utility account in Applicant’s ex-wife’s name with a high 
credit and past-due balance of $87 that was placed for collection in 2011 (SOR &

Applicant paid the collection agent $87.88 in November 2011. The creditor has 
acknowledged that the account had been paid in full.42 The account has been resolved. 
 
There was an account with a children’s book club with a high credit and past-due 
balance of $65 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser in 2012 (SOR

2013. The debt purchaser has acknowledged that the account had been paid in full.44 
The account has been resolved. 
 
There was an account with a regional library with a high credit and past-due 
balance of $65 that was placed for collection in 2007 (SOR & 1.s.).45 Applicant and the 
county school district agreed that the late fees would be dropped if Applicant paid to 
replace the missing books. He paid the agreed amount of $23.45 in November 2011.46  
The account has been resolved. 
 
There was a cable television account with an unpaid balance of $183 that was 
opened by Applicant’s ex-wife while he was deployed and placed for collection and sold 
or transferred to collection agent in 2007 (SOR & 1.t.).47 Applicant contended he paid off 
the account in 2011 when he resolved other accounts.48 The January 2012 credit report

confirms his contention and clearly reflects that the account was paid in November 
2011, leaving a zero balance49 The account has been resolved. 
 
Among those accounts for which Applicant disputed responsibility, claimed an 
inability to resolve, or claimed resolution, are the following: 
 
There is a cable television account with an unpaid balance of $37 that was 
purportedly opened by Applicant’s father (an individual with the identical first and last 
name) while Applicant was deployed and placed for collection and sold or transferred to 
collection agent in 2010 (SOR & 1.d.).50 Applicant contacted the creditors but they 
refused to confirm salient information about the account. While Applicant claimed he 
had disputed the account over a period of months, at the time of the hearing he had not 
formally done so in writing by demanding validation and verification.51 He contended his 
father had actually paid off the balance, but he failed to submit documentation to 
confirm that contention. The March 2013 credit report still lists the account as unpaid,52 
but the June 2013 credit report no longer lists the account.53 In the absence of any 
documentation to confirm that the account is not Applicant’s, that he had disputed the 
account, or that the balance had been paid, I conclude that the account has not been 
resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account opened by Applicant’s ex-wife while he was 
deployed with a high credit of $250 or $395 (depending on which credit report listed the 
account) and an unspecified balance that was placed for collection, charged off, and 
sold to a debt purchaser in 2009 (SOR & 1.g.).54 It was resold to another debt purchaser 
in 2011, which increased the high credit to $557, and the past-due amount to $565.55 
The past-due balance was subsequently increased to $600.56 Applicant contended the 
account was included in his ex-wife’s bankruptcy discharge, but he failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contention. He disputed the account,57 but to date, there 
has been no resolution of his dispute. In the absence of any documentation to confirm 
that the account is not Applicant’s, that the dispute has been decided, or the account 
balance has been paid or otherwise resolved, I conclude that the account has not been 
resolved.

There was a bank account with a high credit of $1,679 that was placed for 
collection, charged off, and transferred or sold to another credit agent in 2008 (SOR & 
1.h.).58 Applicant claimed he was the victim of a fraud or scam, and that the $1,679 was 
withdrawn from his bank account without his knowledge or permission.59 He also initially 
contended that in an effort to clean up his credit when he was able to do so, he paid the 
entire amount in January 2011.60 He subsequently added that the account had been 
included and discharged under his ex-wife’s bankruptcy. Applicant said this was the first 
delinquent account he addressed before his family’s financial problems erupted.61 The 
bank no longer has any record of the account, and Applicant is unable to obtain bank 
records reflecting his payment.62 Applicant has failed to submit any documentation to 
support his contentions that the account has been resolved. However, neither of the 
2013 credit reports reflects the account with another creditor, collection agent, or debt 
purchaser. The only current reference to the original creditor reflects a zero balance.63 I 
conclude the account has been resolved. 
 
There is a secured loan account with a high credit of $1,250, and a balance of 
$1,035, of which $465 was past due, that was placed for collection in 2007 (SOR & 
1.l.).64 Applicant indicated the loan was an emergency loan in the amount of $500 for 
damage to his vehicle, and contended a repayment schedule was set up for automatic 
payments of $100 a month to be taken from his military check.65 Accordingly, he 
believed the account should have been paid off, and he intended to dispute it, but 
apparently did not do so.66 He subsequently learned there had apparently been a glitch 
in the automatic payments, and he purportedly agreed with the creditor to pay $700 or 
$800 over a period of seven months.67 He modified his description of the repayment 
plan and indicated he would pay $20 per month. Applicant has failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contentions that there had been a repayment plan in 
place, that there is a current repayment plan, or that he has made any payments under 
a repayment plan. In the absence of any documentation to confirm any aspect of 
Applicant’s contentions, I conclude that the account has not been resolved.

It is unclear if the remaining accounts alleged in the SOR have been placed in a 
repayment plan or resolution has yet commenced: 
 
There was a three-month lease, for an apartment renting for $550 per month, 
that Applicant and his current wife occupied and vacated. After his wife left him, 
Applicant notified the management office that he too would be vacating when the third 
month expired. He had the apartment inspected, and moved out with no indication of 
any continuing problems.68 Shortly thereafter, he received a notice of a lawsuit filed 
against him alleging smoke damage to the unoccupied apartment. He appeared before 
a judge and was ordered to pay the management office one month’s rent of $713 (SOR 
& 1.a.).69 Applicant contacted the management office to pay the judgment, but the office 
refused the $713 and demanded over $3,000 (SOR & 1.c.).70 Applicant informally 
disputed that amount, and after being unable to convince the management office to 
accept his $713 payment, the matter was ignored for a little over six months.71 Applicant 
requested documentation from the rental office to support the charges of $3,037, but 
they were unable to furnish them.72 There is no indication if Applicant ever formally 
requested validation from the creditor or disputed the $3,037 account listing with the 
credit reporting agencies. After further negotiations, Applicant purportedly offered a 
repayment plan under which he would pay the management office $50 per month, and 
although the management office was unhappy with the plan, it agreed to it. Applicant 
has failed to submit any documentation to support his contentions that there is a current 
repayment plan, or that he has made any payments under a repayment plan. In the 
absence of any documentation to confirm any aspect of Applicant’s contentions, I 
conclude that the account has not been resolved. 
 
There is an automobile finance loan with a high credit of $13,194 that was 
transferred or sold to a collection agent and placed for collection in 2011. Applicant’s 
January 2012 credit report has one credit reporting agency (Experian) listing the 
account with the same high credit and an unpaid balance of $6,585, while another credit 
reporting agency (Equifax) listed the account with a high credit of $7,593 and an unpaid 
balance of $6,585 (SOR & 1.j.).73 The account was charged off, and in 2013, the high 
credit and past-due balance were increased to $15,876.74 Applicant claimed that as part 
of his divorce from his first wife, the account was supposed to be her responsibility, but 
she failed to make the payments and the vehicle was repossessed and sold by the 
creditor.75 Applicant informally disputed the balance. He purportedly spoke to one

representative of the creditor and they were discussing potential repayment 
arrangements for the $6,585 balance, but later spoke to another representative who 
demanded the larger amount.76 No formal dispute has yet been filed with the credit 
reporting agencies. Applicant intended to have his divorce lawyer resolve the issue.77 In 
the absence of any documentation to confirm any aspect of Applicant’s contentions, I 
conclude that the account has not been resolved. 
 
Character References 
 
 Applicant’s military project manager and his former and current direct 
supervisors, are highly supportive of his application to retain his security clearance. 
They have characterized him as professional, committed to duty, responsible, hard-
working, mission and goal-oriented, respected, and trustworthy.78 He has “been a 
source of inspiration to all the military and contractor personnel who observed his 
personal actions.”79 His mother’s employer stressed Applicant’s professionalism, 
trustworthiness, reserved confidence, and integrity.80 Applicant’s mother confirmed 
Applicant’s financial contributions to the family and others, and she characterized him 
as very trustworthy and honest.81 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”82 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”83   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating

conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”84 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.85  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”86 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”87 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in about 2006 or 2007, Applicant started experiencing 
some financial difficulties. Over the next few years, those difficulties increased to the 
point where he was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of 
accounts. His accounts eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for 
collection, charged off, or sold. One account went to judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) 
apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.88 Under AG ¶ 20(e), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the 
                                                          
88
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
14 
                                      
 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(e) partially apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control. His initial financial problems arose in 2006 or 2007 when he 
was deployed and gave his wife his power of attorney. Instead of paying the bills, she 
opened new accounts. The second wave of financial problems occurred while he was 
deployed in 2010, when over a six-week period, Applicant’s parents, brother, and 
brother-in-law all were laid off. With the funds he had hoped to use to resolve his 
delinquent accounts, he instead diverted them to support his parents, brother, sister, 
brother-in-law, and his sister’s two children. He also paid for his sister’s divorce. 
Applicant put food on the table, made the house payments, utility payments, insurance 
payments, and car payments for his entire family over a seven-month period. The 
financial assistance Applicant expended on behalf of his family was overwhelming and 
resulted in a shortage of available funds, and an inability to address his own accounts. 
In addition, he went through one divorce, and is undergoing another divorce. As a 
result, more accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or 
charged off. One account went to judgment. When Applicant’s initial divorce process 
commenced, he was made aware of the full extent of his financial problems when his 
creditors were identified.  
After several false starts and interruptions, Applicant eventually acted responsibly 
by addressing his delinquent accounts.89 He hired an attorney to assist him in his efforts 
to resolve his delinquent accounts by dealing with his creditors and setting up 
repayment plans, but cancelled the effort once he started making sufficient salary to do 
so himself. After the 2010 family issues, he engaged the services of another attorney, 
but that attorney’s fees were simply too high for Applicant to afford. Applicant also 
received some informal financial guidance from his father regarding obtaining a credit 
report and contacting his creditors. Applicant subsequently received formal financial 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
15 
                                      
 
counseling from the financial readiness program manager at his local military facility. 
Applicant contacted all of his creditors, and has either already paid off or otherwise 
resolved most of the accounts, entered into repayment arrangements and is making 
scheduled payments on other accounts, and disputed other accounts. Other accounts 
may have been resolved, but until Applicant submits documentation to support his 
contentions as to the status of those accounts, I have concluded that they are still 
unresolved. Several accounts have not yet been resolved, although Applicant has made 
some efforts to do so, and he is willing to start payment arrangements as soon as he 
receives an amount and repayment schedule. Applicant commenced his efforts with his 
oldest debts and moved towards his newer debts. As noted above, Applicant resolved a 
number of the SOR debts well before the SOR was issued, with others being resolved 
more recently.  
The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
However, those financial problems, especially regarding his entire family’s financial 
devastation within one short period, and the difficulties arising from his ex-wife’s 
handling of his finances while he was deployed, occurred under such circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. As noted above, Applicant essentially informally 
disputed the accuracy of the balances of several accounts, and the responsibility of two 
accounts. While his contentions and informal disputes may have some merit, until 
Applicant submits documentation reflecting formal disputes with the creditors and the 
credit reporting agencies, there is little evidence to substantiate the basis of the 
disputes. Nevertheless, there are clear indications that Applicant’s overall financial 
problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.90 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
                                                          
90
 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
 
16 
                                      
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.91       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection, charged off, or sold, and one account went to 
judgment. When given the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation 
related to specific accounts, Applicant failed to do so for all of those accounts. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has been deployed on three different occasions to locations including 
Afghanistan and Iraq. He is well-respected. Applicant’s financial problems were not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. 
Instead, they were largely beyond his control. Applicant contacted his creditors and 
collection agents, and sought the assistance of two law firms. While he was unable to 
commence making payments simultaneously on all of the accounts, Applicant did 
attempt to enter into repayment plans with his creditors. The result was positive. He 
resolved a number of accounts, including non-SOR accounts, well before the SOR was 
even issued. One account is currently in the process of being resolved and two 
accounts may be in that process. He is either disputing or trying to make arrangements 
to start resolving the few remaining accounts. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:92 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
                                                          
91
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. – 1.t.:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
