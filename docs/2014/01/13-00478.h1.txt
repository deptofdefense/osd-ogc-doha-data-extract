HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
From 1985 to December 2011, Applicant was arrested or cited for five alcohol-
related offenses. He was convicted of driving while intoxicated or impaired (DWI) or 
driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in 1985, 2006, and 2012. He is on probation 
for his most recent DUI. There is no medical diagnosis, evaluation, or prognosis of his 
alcohol consumption; he continues to consume alcohol; and he is not attending any 
ongoing alcohol-related counseling or treatment. After his most recent DUI, he made 
some positive changes in his life; however, more time without alcohol consumption and 
criminal conduct is necessary before alcohol consumption and criminal conduct 
concerns will be fully mitigated. Personal conduct concerns relating to his completion of 
two security clearance applications are mitigated because he did not intend to deceive 
the Government about his alcohol-related criminal arrests, charges, and convictions. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 13, 2006, and September 7, 2012, Applicant submitted his Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance 
applications (SF 86). (GE 1, 4) On May 28, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) the President promulgated on 
December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct), G 
(alcohol consumption), and E (personal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR 
further informed Applicant that DOD adjudicators could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant’s security clearance, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On June 13, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) Applicant waived his 
right to a hearing. On September 16, 2013, Department Counsel generated the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM). (Tr. 14-15, 18, 20-21; HE 5) On October 11, 2013, Applicant 
requested a hearing. (Tr. 17; HE 3) On October 30, 2013, Department Counsel 
indicated he was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On November 14, 2013 
Applicant’s case was assigned to me. On November 22, 2013, DOHA issued a hearing 
notice, setting the hearing for December 6, 2013. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held 
as scheduled. Department Counsel offered 17 exhibits, and Applicant offered one 
exhibit. (Tr. 33-37; GE 1-17; AE A) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-17 
and AE A. (Tr. 35, 37) On December 16, 2013, I received the transcript. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Two procedural issues were resolved at the outset of the hearing. First, Applicant 
agreed to a December 6, 2013 hearing date and to waive his right to 15-days of notice 
of the date, time, and location of his hearing. (Tr. 19-20) Second, SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that 
on September 30, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor 
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, hit and run, and leaving the scene of an 
accident. Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.d because the allegation was not 
substantiated. (Tr. 27, 30, 63-64) The portions of SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 3.b, and 3.c, relating to 
SOR ¶ 1.d are not substantiated and withdrawn. (Tr. 72-73)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, and 2.a, and he 
provided some extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) He denied the remaining 
SOR allegations. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of 
fact.   
 
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or 
locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific 
information. 
 
3 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked as 
a chief operating officer for a government contractor providing services to several 
military installations. (Tr. 6-8, 56) He worked for a government contractor for the last 35 
years and held a security clearance intermittently for 25 or 30 years. (Tr. 7, 58) His 
company will permit him to retain his employment without a security clearance. (Tr. 9) 
However, a security clearance is required in his current position as he is a key 
management person. (Tr. 10, 58) His annual salary is approximately $300,000. (Tr. 95)  
 
In 1972, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He attended college, but 
did not receive a degree. (Tr. 7, 56) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 59-60) In 
1995, he married his spouse. (GE 4) His children were born in 1980 and 1997, and his 
stepchildren were born in 1979 and 1981. (GE 4)    
  
Criminal Offenses and Alcohol Consumption 
 
 On March 28, 1985, Applicant was charged with DUI. (SOR ¶ 1.f) He was 
convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail (27 days suspended), a fine, and community 
service. (Tr. 60) He attended a brief traffic-type class after the DUI. (Tr. 60)  
 
On August 26, 1994, Applicant received a ticket or citation for standing on the 
street with a beer in his hand. (Tr. 61) The citation was for drinking in public. (SOR ¶ 
1.e) He received a fine of about $25. (Tr. 62) 
 
On December 7, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. (Tr. 66; 
SOR ¶ 1.c) On May 10, 2006, he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to one year of 
unsupervised probation, a 3-day class, costs, and a fine. (Tr. 69, 73-74) His lawyer told 
Applicant that the conviction would be taken off of his record. (Tr. 69) 
 
On December 14, 2008, Applicant was drinking alcohol earlier in the evening. 
(Tr. 76) He made an illegal u-turn, and he was going the wrong way on a one-way 
street. (Tr. 75) The police arrested him, and he was charged with DUI. (Tr. 75; SOR ¶ 
1.b) The charge was reduced to reckless driving. (Tr. 77) He was placed on informal 
probation for one year. (Tr. 78) 
 
On December 20, 2011, Applicant drank five to seven, but less than a dozen, 12 
ounce beers over about a three-hour period. (Tr. 104-105) The police stopped Applicant 
because he was driving with a headlight out. (Tr. 80) The police arrested him and 
charged him with DUI. (Tr. 79-80; SOR ¶ 1.a) His blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at 
.178. (Tr. 104) In October 2012, Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to five years 
of information probation, a $6,000 fine ($3,000 suspended), and 60 days in jail (55 days 
suspended), among other punishments. (Tr. 86; GE 16) He is currently on probation; 
however, he is not required to report to a probation officer. (Tr. 87, 101) Applicant was 
required to attend an extensive 19-week outpatient alcohol-treatment program. (Tr. 80; 
SOR response at 9) During the treatment program, he complied with the program’s 
request that he not consume alcohol. (Tr. 83) He resumed his alcohol consumption after 
about six months around April 2013. (Tr. 84) He also attended one year of aftercare.

(Tr. 80; SOR response at 10-11) His driver’s license was suspended for six months, and 
then an interlock device was placed on his car for the next six months. (Tr. 80)  
 
Applicant attended 19 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings from January 9, 
2012 to March 4, 2012, as required by his aftercare program. (Tr. 102) He does not 
attend AA meetings or receive any other ongoing alcohol-related therapy. (Tr. 87-88) He 
met with a medical professional about his alcohol consumption for about 30 minutes. 
(Tr. 82) He did not receive a diagnosis or prognosis. (Tr. 82-83, 103) He continues to 
consume alcohol, but at a lesser level than before his December 20, 2011 DUI. (Tr. 85, 
103) He limits his alcohol consumption to two drinks during an evening. (Tr. 86) He 
does not drive after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 85) He was sorry for some of the decisions 
he made, and he assured that the offenses would not occur in the future. (Tr. 96-97) 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 Applicant told his FSO about the DWI arrest the next day after his December 7, 
2005 DWI arrest. (Tr. 69, 99) When Applicant completed his July 13, 2006 SF 86, he 
was asked whether he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol and 
drugs. (SOR ¶ 3.d) He responded, yes, and he disclosed his December 2005 DWI 
arrest. (Tr. 70; SOR ¶ 1.c) He did not disclose his citation for drinking in public citation in 
1994 because he did not consider it an arrest. (Tr. 71) He did not report the 1985 DUI 
because he thought he was only required to report arrests in the last seven years. (Tr. 
71-72) He did not intentionally attempt to conceal information from security officials. (Tr. 
72) He expressed regret and remorse for his carelessness in the omission of complete 
information on his July 13, 2006 SF 86.  
 
Ms. D, Applicant’s facility security officer (FSO) stated that she was aware of 
Applicant’s DUIs in 2005 and 2008 because Applicant disclosed them to her shortly 
after his arrests. (Tr. 43, 48-50) After he had the 2011 DUI, Applicant discussed it with 
Ms. D, and she told him to disclose it to his FSO. (Tr. 51) Over the years, there were 
some changes in the format and content of the questions on the SF 86, which caused 
confusion. (Tr. 43) Some people have answered questions for seven years instead of 
recognizing that the question sought all of the information about drug or alcohol arrests, 
regardless of how long ago the drug or alcohol offense occurred. (Tr. 44) 
 
 When Applicant completed his September 7, 2012 SF 86, he was asked three 
relevant questions in sections 22 and 24 as follows: (1) “In the past seven (7) years 
have you been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type of law 
enforcement officer?” (SOR ¶ 2.a); (2) “Other than those offenses already listed, have 
you EVER had the following happen to you? . . . Have you EVER been charged with an 
offense involving alcohol or drugs?” (SOR ¶ 2.b); and (3) “In the last 7 years has your 
use of alcohol . . . resulted in intervention by law enforcement/public safety personnel?” 
(SOR ¶ 2.c)  Applicant responded, yes, to the first question and disclosed his 2011 DUI 
arrest; however, he did not disclose his other alcohol-related arrests in 1985, 2005, and 
2008. (Tr. 89; GE 4)  
 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In regard to Applicant’s September 7, 2012 SF 86, he did not report the 
December 7, 2005 arrest because he thought it was outside the seven-year 
requirement, even though it was actually within seven years. (Tr. 90) He did not report 
the 2008 DUI arrest because he believed it was really a reckless driving case. (Tr. 90) 
He did not have records concerning his arrests or consult with his FSO when he 
completed his SF 86. (Tr. 94-95) He also thought the Government knew about the 
arrest already because whenever Applicant had an alcohol-related incident, he notified 
his FSO. (Tr. 30, 108) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, who 
interviewed Applicant on December 14, 2012, was aware of his 2008 DUI arrest. (Tr. 
108; GE 17) Applicant acknowledged he did not read the questions carefully; he 
mistakenly failed to provide the requested information on his SF 86; and it was not his 
intention to deceive the Government about his alcohol-related offenses. (Tr. 31, 91) He 
promised that he would be more careful and scrupulously accurate in the completion of 
his security documents. (Tr. 97) 
  
Character Evidence 
 
 Ms. D was the Director of Security and Corporate Facility Security Officer for 
Applicant’s company from 2005 to 2010. She has 29 years of security experience, 
including more than 20 years as a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service and 
eight years working for Applicant’s company. (Tr. 40, 46, 50) Applicant is very 
supportive and conscientious about security issues. (Tr. 45) He did not commit any 
security violations, and there were never any allegations questioning his moral 
character, integrity, or honesty. (Tr. 45, 54) Applicant is fair, honest, and forthright. (Tr. 
53)        
 
 Applicant’s Chief Executive Officer has known him for more than 12 years. (AE 
A) Applicant has good character and sound judgment. “He performs his duties in an 
exemplary fashion and has become integral to the success of the company. . . . He has 
my trust and support. . . .” (AE A)  
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse 
clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Nothing in this decision 
should be construed to suggest that I based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.”  
   
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Four Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 22 could raise a 
security or trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. Those four 
disqualifying conditions as alleged in the SOR provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; and 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(d) and 22(e) do not apply. There was no diagnosis or evaluation of 
Applicant’s consumption of alcohol. Applicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to 
the extent of impaired judgment on December 20, 2011, when he consumed sufficient 
alcohol to have a BAC of .178, and was arrested for DUI.2 His alcohol consumption or 
involvement from 1985 to December 2011 resulted in four arrests and one citation. He 
was convicted of DWI or DUI three times in 1985, 2006, and 2012. He is on probation 
for his most recent DUI. AG ¶ 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d) apply.  
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-23(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
                                            
2Although the term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Directive, the generally accepted 
definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two hours.
 
The 
definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 
NIAAA Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), http://www.pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/ 
winter2004/NewsletterNumber3.pdf.

(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
AG ¶ 23(a) to 23(d) partially apply. Three of Applicant’s five alcohol-related 
arrests or citations were between 1985 and 1995. Those three alcohol-related offenses 
are too temporally remote to have significant security significance other than to show his 
lengthy history of alcohol-related offenses. Applicant had no alcohol-related involvement 
with the police or courts until 2005, a period of 10 years. He had two alcohol-related 
DWI or DUI convictions in 2006 and 2012. He attended and successfully completed an 
intensive outpatient program after his December 2011 DUI, including aftercare, and was 
able to refrain from alcohol consumption for six months. However, in April 2013, he 
resumed his alcohol consumption; there is no medical diagnosis or evaluation of his 
alcohol consumption; and he is not attending any ongoing alcohol-relating counseling or 
treatment. He has not attended any intensive, inpatient alcohol rehabilitation or 
counseling program.    
Applicant described some alcohol-related counseling and attendance at 19 AA 
meetings from January 9, 2012 to March 4, 2012; however, he is not currently 
participating in alcohol-related counseling or treatment. There are no statements from 
counseling programs positively describing his prognosis.      
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of 
substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless 
there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR 
Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  For 
example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant 
continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge’s 
application of MC 3.”   
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board 
reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB 
had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most recent DUI was in 
2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
 
9 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol 
(not to intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued 
alcohol consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary 
and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) 
(involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and 
reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
After careful consideration of the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption, I conclude his successful completion of an intensive outpatient alcohol 
counseling and treatment program, his abstinence from alcohol consumption until April 
2013, and then his responsible consumption of alcohol thereafter, are not sufficient to 
establish his alcohol consumption is under control. His alcohol consumption continues 
to cast doubt on Applicant’s “current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
Alcohol consumption concerns are not mitigated.       
 
Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, “Criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its 
very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, 
rules and regulations.” 
 
AG ¶ 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may 
be disqualifying in this case, “(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,” “(c) 
allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,” and “(d) individual is currently on 
parole or probation.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 31(a), 31(c), and 31(d) apply. From 1985 to December 2011, Applicant 
was arrested four times and cited once for alcohol-related offenses, including three 
arrests and convictions for DWI or DUI. His offenses resulted in convictions, fines, and 
other penalties. He is currently on unsupervised probation.  
 
AG ¶ 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; 
 
(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those 
pressures are no longer present in the person's life; 
 
(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited 
to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. 
 
Although none of the mitigating conditions fully apply, there are important 
mitigating factors. The most recent offense occurred on December 20, 2011, and he 
has not committed any criminal offenses for more than two years. He complied with all 
the terms of his most ongoing probation. He has been continuously employed for more 
than 30 years. He expressed regret and remorse concerning his alcohol-related 
offenses. The comments in the previous section about mitigation of alcohol-
consumption concerns are incorporated into this section.  
 
The offense described in SOR ¶ 1.e (drinking in public or possession of an open 
container of alcohol in public) was a citation and resulted in a $25 fine. SOR ¶ 1.e is an 
offense, but is not established to be a criminal offense and is mitigated.    
 
Significant factors weighing against mitigating criminal conduct concerns remain. 
He will remain on probation for several years. The state has determined that the 
passage of more time under the conditions of probation and without any serious criminal 
misconduct is necessary to protect society and establish rehabilitation. More time must 
elapse before there is enough assurance that criminal conduct and other behavior 
raising security concerns is unlikely to recur. Criminal conduct concerns are not fully 
mitigated at this time.   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to Applicant’s alleged falsifications of his July 13, 2006, and 
September 7, 2012, SF 86s, “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities.”3  
                                            
3The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
 
11 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
Applicant’s statements explaining why he did not provide derogatory information 
about his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct on his July 13, 2006, and 
September 7, 2012, SF86s are credible. His omissions and misstatements were errors 
made through carelessness and oversight. He refuted the allegations that he 
intentionally falsified his July 13, 2006, and September 7, 2012, SF86s. He regrets his 
mistakes, and he would not make the same mistakes today. Moreover, he corrected the 
omission, concealment, or falsification in good faith. When questioned about his alcohol 
consumption and criminal conduct, he fully and frankly described his history in these 
two areas. Personal conduct concerns raised by his omissions on his July 13, 2006, and 
September 7, 2012, SF86s are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under 
Guidelines J, G, and E are incorporated into my whole-person analysis. Some of the 
factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant 
additional comment. 
 
There is considerable evidence supporting continuation of Applicant’s access to 
classified information. Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who 
has worked as a chief operating officer for a government contractor providing services 
to several military installations. Applicant is conscientious about security issues. There 
                                                                                                                                            
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
were no allegations questioning his moral character, integrity, or honesty. Applicant is a 
fair, honest, and forthright employee with good character and sound judgment, who 
performs his employee and management duties in an exemplary fashion. He has 
worked for a government contractor for the last 35 years and held a security clearance 
for 25 or 30 years without any security violations. There is no evidence at his current 
employment of any disciplinary problems, disloyalty, or that he would intentionally 
violate national security.   
 
The evidence supporting revocation of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial 
than the evidence supporting continuation of his security clearance. Applicant has three 
serious offenses—his three convictions for DWI or DUI in 1985, 2006, and 2012. He is 
on probation for his most recent DUI. Moreover, each and every time he drove while 
impaired or intoxicated is a serious criminal offense in which he endangered himself and 
others. Excessive alcohol consumption followed by driving a motor vehicle shows a lack 
of judgment, rehabilitation, and impulse control. There is no medical diagnosis, 
evaluation, or prognosis of his alcohol consumption; he continues to consume alcohol; 
and he is not attending any ongoing alcohol-related counseling or treatment. “By its very 
nature, [criminal conduct] calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply 
with laws, rules and regulations.” (AG ¶ 30) Alcohol consumption and criminal conduct 
concerns are not mitigated. More time without any alcohol-related criminal offenses 
must elapse to fully mitigate security concerns.  
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude continuation of Applicant’s 
access to classified information is not warranted at this time.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant’s security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is revoked.
