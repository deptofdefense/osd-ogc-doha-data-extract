GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 15, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On April 26, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on May 31, 
2013.2 On September 17, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR, because there is no signed 
receipt in the case file. In a sworn statement, dated October 16, 2013, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on 
November 14, 2013. The case was assigned to me on November 15, 2013. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on December 3, 2013, amended on December 6, 2013, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 18, 2013.3 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and 12 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE L) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 2, 2014. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. She submitted 13 additional documents, which were marked as 
exhibits (AE M through AE Y) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record 
closed on December 30, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted six of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c. through 1.e., 1.g., and 1.j.). 
Applicant’s explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, 
I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor (her cohabitant/ 
fiancée/employer/driving partner) who, since March 1987, has served as a long haul 
truck driver, hauling freight, including military supplies and weapons.4 She never served 
in the U.S. military.5 She has held a secret security clearance since 1989. Applicant 
graduated from high school in May 1968,6 and attended college for six months. She was

 The Directive established that notification as to the time and place of a hearing be furnished to an applicant 
at least 15 days in advance of the time of the hearing.  See, Directive, Encl. 3, § E3.1.8. In this instance, Department 
Counsel and Applicant were in discussions regarding the potential time and location long before the actual Notice of 
Hearing was issued. Nevertheless, because the period between the issuance of the Notice and receipt of the Notice 
was less than 15 days, I inquired of Applicant if the period of notice was sufficient, and Applicant specifically waived 
the 15-day notice requirement. See, Tr. at 19-21.

married in February 1969, separated in January 1984, and divorced in November 
1984.7 She has been cohabiting with her fiancée/employer/driving partner since March 
1987.8 Applicant and her ex-husband have two children, a daughter born in 1969, and a 
son born in 1974.9  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about November 
2006. Although her ex-husband did not furnish her any alimony or child support after 
they separated and eventually divorced, and she supported herself and her two children 
as a single parent, she was able to meet her minimum monthly payments. She helped 
pay for her children’s college education and at least partially supported her children and 
grandchildren.10 By 2006, she had approximately $50,000 in credit card debt, but her 
accounts were all current.  
Commencing in 2001, and continuing through 2013, Applicant’s cohabitant and 
Applicant were periodically unable to work as a team for several months at a time.11 
Health issues arose, including surgeries for bladder, prostate, gall-bladder, eyes, and 
hernia, as well as injuries from accidents, including broken foot, broken ribs, and a 
shoulder injury. In addition, there were times when the truck and trailer needed 
repairs.12 Those various issues sometimes kept them off the road up to 12 weeks at a 
time.13 When they were not on the road hauling freight, they earned no salary.14 When 
the national economy started to deteriorate, Applicant’s cohabitant was confronted with 
higher fuel prices and lower contract rates, essentially reducing Applicant’s income.15  
Credit card issuers started raising their interest rates on her credit cards, and 
because of the increases, Applicant was unable to pay all of her monthly minimum 
amounts. One bank induced her to accept another of its credit cards at a reduced 
interest rate, but instead of substituting the new card for the older card, she was left with 
an additional credit card, making it even more difficult for her to remain current on all of

her accounts.16 Another credit card issuer furnished her convenience checks to use in 
paying her bills, but those checks contributed to the increase in that card’s balance.17 
One of the convenience checks bounced when, in the middle of the transaction, the 
issuer lowered Applicant’s credit limit, causing a problem with the creditor to whom 
Applicant had intended to pay.18 As a result of the increased finance charges and 
additional accounts, various accounts became past due, placed for collection, charged 
off, or transferred or sold to other collection agents or debt buyers. One account went to 
judgment. 
In November 2006, as part of her effort to establish a repayment program, 
Applicant received financial counseling from the consumer Credit Counseling Service 
(CCCS). That effort failed when CCCS informed her that she had insufficient income to 
establish the minimum payment plan, and referred her back to her creditors.19  
In April 2007, Applicant contacted a law firm doing business as a debt settlement 
and consolidation company in an effort to assist her in resolving her delinquent debts. 
The firm was supposed to negotiate with the creditors on Applicant’s behalf by settling 
her unsecured debts at amounts less than that actually owed to the creditors. Applicant 
was told to stop paying her credit card debts and, with their assistance, Applicant’s 
debts would be resolved in three years.20 Pursuant to the debt settlement and 
consolidation program, Applicant made $600 monthly payments for four months. In July 
2007, because of various regulations, there were a number of legal disagreements 
between regulators and the debt settlement industry, and that particular law firm/debt 
consolidation company was not legally permitted to operate in Applicant’s state.21 As a 
result of state intervention, Applicant’s payments were refunded to her.22 By then, 
Applicant was too far behind on her credit card balances to catch up.23 
At some point, Applicant believed the interest and late penalties on the cards 
became greater than the principal owed. She started receiving calls from her creditors 
offering to settle the accounts for reduced amounts provided she made large lump sum 
payments. Those amounts were still too large for Applicant to afford.24 She discussed 
the matter with another attorney who promised to discuss debt consolidation with the

creditors, but he subsequently failed to call Applicant back. She then went to another 
attorney who advised her about the statute of limitations law regarding credit card 
accounts. He said that after three years of inaction, the creditors could no longer obtain 
judgments against her on the accounts.25 Applicant’s delinquent credit card debts are 
old debts on which the statute of limitations has lapsed,26 and, as noted by Applicant, 
should be dropped from her credit report in 2014.27  
Applicant has not applied for any credit during the past six years. Her residence 
is mortgage-free, her automobile is owned outright, and the truck and trucking 
equipment are all paid for.28 Furthermore, Applicant’s residence, motor vehicle, 
household goods, and burial plot have been designated as exempt property by the 
state.29 She is current on all other financial obligations.30 With respect to Applicant’s 
delinquent accounts, after years of harassment calls from collection agents, she no 
longer receives any such calls.31 Various credit card issuers still send her applications to 
open new credit card accounts, but she cuts them up and throws them away.32   
Within the limits of her available financial resources, Applicant made many efforts 
to resolve her delinquent accounts. Nevertheless, her efforts were generally thwarted by 
two pieces of guidance. Although her efforts to pay her accounts were restricted by 
insufficient income, the guidance received in 2007 from one of her attorneys was a 
major consideration in her eventual inaction. The legal advice about the statute of 
limitations was accurate and led her to believe that once the creditors could not obtain 
judgments against her for the delinquent accounts, she would no longer have any 
concern about her finances or her security clearance. Applicant also received periodic 
guidance from her assistant facility security officer (FSO) in which she was advised to 
avoid bankruptcy at all costs because resolution of delinquent debts by bankruptcy 
would be the basis to revoke her security clearance.33 Applicant is financially naive. 
Afraid to file for bankruptcy, and unable to make the necessary minimum monthly 
payments, Applicant relied in her attorney’s advice to do nothing until the statute of 
limitations expired. Some of her non-SOR accounts were paid off, while others were

resolved with the issuance of a Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt), and Applicant’s 
paying the income tax of the cancelled amounts.34 
In May 2013, Applicant provided a personal financial statement reflecting a 
monthly net income, including social security, of $1,618; monthly household, business, 
utility, transportation, and food expenses of $996; and monthly debt payments of $199; 
leaving a monthly remainder of $423 available for discretionary savings or 
expenditures.35 In December 2013, Applicant provided an updated personal financial 
statement reflecting a monthly net income, including social security, of $1,492; monthly 
household, business, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $1,101; and monthly 
debt payments of $197; leaving a monthly remainder of $194 available for discretionary 
savings or expenditures.36 
The SOR identified ten delinquent debts totaling $92,112 that had been placed 
for collection, charged off, or went to judgment, as generally reflected by a 2011 credit 
report37 and a 2013 credit report.38 Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in some instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. 
Several accounts are listed with only partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the 
SOR, some of which are also duplicates of other accounts alleged, and their respective 
current status, according to the credit reports, evidence submitted by the Government 
and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.f., and 1.i.) There is one credit card account with a credit 
limit of $4,500 that was placed for collection and charged off in the amount of $5,561.39 
The account was sold by the original creditor (the one alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.) to another 
lender (the one alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.), which increased the balance to $12,942.40 The 
account was subsequently sold seriatim three additional times. It was sold to one 
company (the one alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i.),41 as well as another company whose name 
does not appear in the SOR.42 It also appears that it was repurchased by one of the

earlier purchasers (the one alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i.).43 Adding to the confusion, the 
account was apparently transferred to another agency that obtained a judgment in the 
amount of $6,005.99 against Applicant in November 2008.44 In July 2009, the balance 
was $7,780.55, plus interest, and by October 2009, the balance was increased to 
$8,095.45 Based on all of the above, I conclude that the four allegations actually refer to 
the same account in various stages of development as reflected in various credit 
reports. SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.f., and 1.i. are considered duplicates of SOR ¶ 1.a. and the only 
unpaid balance is that set forth in the judgment. The various listings are expected to be 
automatically removed from the credit reports in April, June, and August 2014.46 
Nevertheless, that account has still not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $2,000 and a 
high balance and past due balance of either $2,335 or $2,373 that was placed for 
collection and charged off.47 The listing is expected to be automatically removed from 
the credit reports in January 2014.48 The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $3,300, a high 
balance of $3,605, and a past due balance of either $3,567, $3,578, or $3,605, that was 
placed for collection and charged off.49 The listing is expected to be automatically 
removed from the credit reports in January 2014.50 The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $6,200, a high 
balance of $7,192, and a past due balance of either $7,150, $7,154, or $7,192, that was 
placed for collection and charged off.51 The listing is expected to be automatically 
removed from the credit reports in January 2014.52 The account has not been resolved.

Work Performance 
 
 The president, as well as the director of government operations/assistant FSO, 
are both enthusiastically supportive of Applicant’s application to retain her security 
clearance. Applicant has always “presented herself well and performed her job duties in 
the utmost professional manner.” She has moved arms, ammunition, and explosives for 
the troops in a timely and orderly manner. Applicant’s work ethics are considered 
outstanding.  Several customers and government installations have praised Applicant’s 
excellent performance.59 As noted by the Director, Navy Operational Logistics Support 
Center, “Our young sailors sure count on you! Thanks!”60 A social friend, who has 
known Applicant since 1986, described Applicant’s “loyalty to her family, friends, and

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”62 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”63   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”64 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.65

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”66 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”67 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2006, Applicant started experiencing some financial

difficulties. Over the next few years, those difficulties increased to the point where she 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of credit card accounts. 
Those accounts eventually became delinquent and were placed for collection. One 
account went to judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.68 In addition, if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 
20(e) may apply. 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies, AG ¶¶ 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) partially apply, and AG ¶ 20(a) 
does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial 
difficulties since 2006 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was 
so infrequent.” Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, and she did not spend beyond her means. Instead, her financial 
problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. Her cohabitant developed bladder 
cancer, and he and Applicant were unable to work as a driver team for several months. 
Each of them had additional health issues, including surgeries for bladder, prostate, 
gall-bladder, and hernia, as well as injuries from accidents, including broken foot, 
broken ribs, and a shoulder injury. At times, the truck and trailer needed repairs. Those 
various issues sometimes kept them off the road up to 12 weeks at a time, and when 
they were not on the road hauling freight, they earned no salary. The deteriorating 
                                                          
68
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

national economy caused higher fuel prices and lower contract rates. Adding to her 
financial woes, Applicant supported her children and grandchildren.  
Applicant tried working with her creditors, who were less than helpful, to reduce 
her balances; with CCCS, which was unable to assist her to establish a repayment 
program because she had insufficient income to establish a minimum payment plan; 
with a law firm/debt settlement and consolidation company to settle and resolve 
accounts, only to be informed that the attorney was functioning illegally within the state; 
with another attorney to enter a debt consolidation plan; and another attorney who 
advised her not to make any payments and simply wait until the state of limitations had 
expired. She explored bankruptcy, but was frightened off when her assistant FSO 
advised her to avoid bankruptcy at all costs because resolution of delinquent debts by 
bankruptcy would be the basis to revoke her security clearance.  
Applicant attempted to act responsibly by addressing her delinquent accounts.69 
She either paid off, settled, or otherwise resolved all of her non-SOR accounts, and is 
current on all of her newer accounts. The only accounts continuing to be delinquent are 
the 7 (out of 10) accounts appearing in the SOR. Of those seven accounts, some have 
been sold to unidentified debt purchasers, and none of the creditors continue to call or 
write her seeking payment. Although the seven delinquent accounts, totaling $65,514 
rather than the $92,112 alleged, are significant, nevertheless, there are clear indications 
that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting her, following the conflicting guidance from her attorneys and 
the assistant FSO, do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.70 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
                                                          
69
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.71       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Her handling of 
her finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off. In one instance, an account went to 
judgment. She failed to: make minimum monthly payments, enter into repayment plans, 
resolve any of the seven remaining delinquent credit card accounts, or file for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, she awaited the 
expiration of the statute of limitations, and now awaits the dates when the accounts will 
be automatically removed from her credit reports. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and she did not spend beyond her means. Rather, her problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control because of her repeated and sometimes lengthy layoffs due to 
health issues and vehicle repair issues, as well as support of her children and 
grandchildren as a single parent with no child support or alimony from her ex-husband. 
Applicant is financially naive. Nevertheless, she paid off, settled, or otherwise resolved 
all of her non-SOR accounts, and is current on all of her newer accounts. Only 7 of the 
10 accounts appearing in the SOR continue to be delinquent. As noted above, three of 
the purported delinquencies appearing in the SOR are actually duplicates of the same 
account in various stages of development. Nevertheless, there are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting her, following the conflicting guidance from her attorneys and 
the assistant FSO, do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. Applicant has had a clearance since 1989, and her financial problems have 
existed since 2006. Her legal responsibility for the debts, except for the single judgment 
account, under the statute of limitations, has expired. The listings of those delinquent 
debts will be automatically removed from her credit reports within the next few months, 
and the overall security concern should be resolved. The entire situation occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Furthermore, it is interesting to 
note, that although Applicant has a history of delinquent accounts, various credit card 
issuers are still pursuing her in an effort to offer her additional credit cards.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:72 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve her 
non-SOR accounts. Unfortunately, she was unable to resolve the remaining delinquent 
accounts due to insufficient funds and the combination of legal advice and assistant 
FSO guidance. This decision should serve as a warning that her failure to continue her 
debt resolution efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect her 
future eligibility for a security clearance.73 Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
                                                          
72
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
73
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005);

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
