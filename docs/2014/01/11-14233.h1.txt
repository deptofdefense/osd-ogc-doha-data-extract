Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows he has a
longstanding history of financial problems that includes multiple bankruptcy cases and
back taxes owed to state and federal tax authorities. He did not present sufficient
evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Accordingly, this
case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On June 24, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a statement
of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 The falsification allegation in SOR ¶ 2(a) alleges that in September 2011 Applicant made a false statement2
during an official background investigation when he denied missing a payment for his most recent Chapter
13 bankruptcy case. Although his statement was factually incorrect, I am not persuaded it was deliberately
false because he was operating under a mistaken belief or notion at the time due to his interactions with his
bankruptcy attorney. Accordingly, the falsification allegation is decided for Applicant, and this subject will not
be discussed further herein.

national interest to grant or continue access to classified information.  The SOR is1
similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the security
guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for
personal conduct (falsification).   2
Applicant answered the SOR on July 11, 2013, and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me September 11, 2013. The hearing was scheduled for October
8, 2013, but was cancelled due to the shutdown of the federal government. The case
was rescheduled and heard on November 19, 2013. The record was kept open until
December 2, 2013, to allow Applicant to present documentary information concerning
the falsification allegation under Guideline E. Applicant was unable to obtain such
information, and the record closed December 2, 2013. The transcript (Tr.) was received
November 27, 2013.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant admits all the SOR allegations under Guideline F. His admissions are
accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, the following
findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His first marriage
ended by divorce, he remarried in 1996, and he and his wife have a 16-year-old
daughter. His educational background includes a high school diploma as well as
certificates from technical schools received in 1998, 2004, and 2010. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance for his job as a coating technician, a job he has held since
June 2011. To that end, he completed a security clearance application in July 2011.3
A review of Applicant’s security clearance application indicates a degree of
instability based on his employment history and multiple residences. Including his
current job, he has held six different jobs from 2003 to present, and he was

 Exhibit 2. 5
 Tr. 51–52. 6
 Exhibits A–C. 7
3
unemployed from April 2010 to June 2011. And he has had eight different residential
addresses in two states during 1998–to 2013. 
Applicant has a longstanding history of financial problems that is ongoing.  As4
alleged in the SOR, his history includes multiple bankruptcy cases and back taxes owed
to state and federal tax authorities. In addition, the SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts. 
Applicant has had three bankruptcy cases ending in discharge.  The first case,5
under Chapter 13, was filed in 1993 and ended in a discharge in 1996. It was a joint
case with his then first wife. He attributes part of his financial problems at that time to
his first wife’s substance-abuse problem.  The second case, under Chapter 7, was filed6
and discharged in 2003. It was a joint case with his current wife. The third case, initially
under Chapter 13, was filed in 2008 and ended in a discharge under Chapter 7 in 2012.
It was also a joint case with his current wife. The bankruptcy petition listed $11,660 in
secured debt (two auto loans), $14,869 in unsecured priority debt (back taxes owed to
the IRS and the state), and $19,842 in unsecured nonpriority debt (typical consumer
debts). Applicant defaulted on the court-approved payment plan in 2010 and 2011, and
it was converted to a Chapter 7 case in September 2011. A discharge was granted in
January 2012. The bankruptcy paperwork shows that $9,984 was disbursed to creditors
while the Chapter 13 payment plan was in effect.  
Applicant owes back taxes to the IRS, which he is endeavoring to resolve.  The7
SOR alleged an indebtedness of $12,996 for multiple tax years; the most recent
bankruptcy paperwork shows a balance of $17,039 as of October 2011; and paperwork
from the IRS shows a balance of $18,672 for tax years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, and
2010, as of September 2013. Applicant made arrangements to resolve his account with
the IRS in February 2013, when he entered into an installment agreement to pay $75
monthly beginning in March 2013. In addition, in about January 2013, he filed
paperwork with the IRS asking for a determination, for federal tax purposes, concerning
his work relationship with a previous employer. He believes if he prevails, and is found
to be an employee instead of an independent contractor, his federal tax indebtedness
will decrease. His request was pending with the IRS at the time of the hearing in this
case. 
Applicant owes back taxes to his state of current residence, and this matter is not
resolved. The most recent bankruptcy paperwork shows a balance of about $445 owed
to a state tax commission for tax year 2007. In addition, a state tax lien for $1,344 was
 Exhibit 4. 8
 Tr. 20. 9
 Exhibits 5, 6, and 7. 10
 Exhibit 2. 11
 Exhibit 3. 12

filed against Applicant in February 2012.  That lien is in addition to a state tax lien for8
$2,140 filed and released in 1996, and a state tax lien for $1,618 filed and released in
1997. Applicant presented no documentation of the current status of the back taxes
owed the state, but indicated he and his wife are working on it. 
The SOR alleged 16 delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $8 to $13,867
for a total of about $28,634. Of those 16 debts, many were included in the most recent
bankruptcy case. Specifically, Department Counsel conceded that the seven debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1(g) for $30, 1(h) for $8, 1(i) for $18, 1(j) for $36, 1(p) for $164, 1(q) for $55,
and 1(s) for $533 were discharged in the bankruptcy case.  Accordingly, these seven9
debts are decided for Applicant due to this duplication.   
Of the nine remaining debts, the two largest, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1(u) and 1(v),
stem from secured loans obtained from the same credit union to buy autos. Both
accounts are listed in the 2011 credit report, but neither are listed in credit reports from
2012 and 2013.  One of those autos, a Chevy Silverado, was redeemed through the10
bankruptcy case in 2013 for the amount of $7,500, of which $6,500 had been paid by
Applicant, leaving a $1,200 balance due to the credit union.  Applicant paid the balance11
due upon entry of the redemption order, and the Silverado is now in his possession. The
other auto, a Nissan Xterra, was surrendered to the credit union during the bankruptcy
case. Applicant stated he has not received notice of a deficiency from the credit union
after the Xterra was sold. In light of these facts and circumstances, SOR ¶¶ 1(u) and
1(v) are decided for Applicant. 
The other seven debts for a total of about $1,346, which have not been
specifically discussed, were not included in the bankruptcy case as far as I can
determine. Applicant did not present any documentary evidence showing that he has
paid, settled, entered into repayment agreements, disputed, or otherwise resolved those
seven debts. 
Applicant’s current financial situation is difficult. In a recent (2012 or 2013)
personal financial statement, he indicated that expenses exceeded income resulting in a
negative net remainder of about $1,089 per month.  During the hearing, he modified12

estimated their 2012 household income at less than $60,000.   14
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As15
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt16
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An17
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  18
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting19
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An20
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate21
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme22
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.23

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.24
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it25
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant26
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline27
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  28
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. His unfavorable financial history indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The29 30
facts are more than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions. And the same
facts support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. 
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  Based on the evidence31
before me, none of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are sufficient
to fully mitigate the security concern. Applicant has a longstanding history of financial
problems, which is ongoing. It includes three bankruptcy cases, the most recent of
which began in 2008 under Chapter 13 but was converted to a Chapter 7 case in 2011
after he defaulted on the payment plan. With three bankruptcy cases ending in
discharge in 1996, 2003, and 2012, it suggest he intends to manage his finances by
seeking bankruptcy protection every seven to nine years or so. Moreover, he continues
to owe back taxes to both state and federal tax authorities, and it is difficult to predict if
or when he will resolve those matters. 
With that said, I am not overly concerned about the seven debts for $1,346 in
unresolved consumer debt. Viewed in light of the facts and circumstances of this case,
those debts are relatively minor and they add little to the analysis. No doubt, some of
Applicant’s financial difficulties may be traced to his failed first marriage and an
unsteady or inconsistent employment history, including a period of unemployment
during 2010–2011. Nonetheless, those matters are not sufficient to overcome the
totality of his adverse financial history.
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and32
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 33
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).34

outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.33
Here, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
and taken actions to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the security concern
under the Appeal Board’s standard.
Applicant’s history of financial problems raises doubt about his judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I
resolve the doubt in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-
person concept.  Having done so, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate34
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.g–1.v: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant
Subparagraph 2.a: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
