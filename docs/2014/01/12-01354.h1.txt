HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s delinquent nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2003. He subsequently generated 12 
delinquent, collection, or charged-off debts, totaling $35,016, which are listed on his 
statement of reasons (SOR). He failed to mitigate nine delinquent SOR debts, totaling 
$34,301. He did not provide sufficient documentation of progress resolving his financial 
problems. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 9, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 5) On July 23, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On August 9, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and on August 
14, 2013, Applicant waived his right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), dated September 24, 2013, was provided to him on 
November 4, 2013.1 Applicant responded to the FORM, providing a one-page statement 
addressing the SOR debts. Department Counsel did not object to consideration of 
Applicant’s FORM response. The case was assigned to me on December 19, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s August 8, 2013 SOR response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR 
allegations and explained that in regard to SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m, he 
planned to file bankruptcy. (Item 4) He planned to dispute the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.k, 
and 1.l because he believes his insurance should have paid these debts.  He did not 
provide any corroborating documentation from creditors, disputes, or bankruptcy 
schedules as part of his SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 68 years old, and he has worked as an electro-mechanical 
technician since 1995.3 (Item 5) In 1963, he graduated from high school. In 1964, he 
married. His two daughters were born in 1975 and 1977. He has never served on active 
duty. He began his employment with a defense contractor in January 2011. There is no 
evidence of criminal arrests or convictions or use of illegal drugs or alcohol abuse. He 
has previously held a security clearance.  
 
When Applicant completed his November 9, 2011 SF 86, he disclosed a 
delinquent debt of $2,526 that began in October 2010 and resulted in garnishment of his 
pay. He also revealed a vehicle repossession debt of $22,000 that began in October 
2010.   
 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 28, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated 
November 4, 2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt 
to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy.  
 
3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraphs are from Applicant’s 
November 8, 2011 SF 86. (Item 5)

Applicant had hernia surgery and has colon cancer, and his spouse has lupus 
and cancer.4 Applicant indicates that absent these medical problems he would not have 
any delinquent debts. He had medical insurance, which should have paid most or all of 
his medical bills. More than half of the delinquent SOR debt resulted from the voluntary 
repossession of Applicant’s vehicle in January 2006.  Applicant’s spouse had medical 
problems and she could not climb into and out of the vehicle.  Applicant contacted the 
dealership, and they suggested he return the vehicle. Applicant erroneously believed he 
would not owe anything on the vehicle; however, the vehicle was resold for a low 
amount, resulting in a large debt. Applicant has not had any recent financial counseling.  
 
Applicant’s SOR and credit bureau reports, dated November 19, 2011, and 
March 1, 2013, describe 12 delinquent, collection, or charged-off debts, totaling $35,016 
as follows: (1) ¶ 1.a is a judgment filed in May 2009 ($18,436); (2) ¶ 1.b is a judgment 
filed in July 2008 ($1,055); (3) ¶ 1.c is a telecommunications collection account ($612); 
(4) and (5) ¶ 1.d and ¶ 1.e are two telecommunications accounts, originating with the 
same creditor and being collected by the same collection company ($118 and $461); 
(6)-(8) ¶¶ 1.f ($165), 1.k ($133), and 1.l ($417) are three delinquent medical debts; (9) ¶ 
1.g is a charged off account ($497); (10) ¶ 1.h is a charged off debt ($10,488); (11) and 
(12) ¶¶ 1.j and 1.m are telecommunications collection debts ($2,086 and $548). 
 
Applicant’s undated personal financial statement (PFS) shows his monthly gross 
salary is $5,314; his monthly net salary is $3,770; and his monthly net remainder after 
subtracting expenses is $1,190.5 No assets, savings, or investments are listed. He is 
receiving a civil service retirement of $2,370. He provided a statement from Social 
Security indicating he is receiving a monthly benefit of $828. (Item 6) Applicant’s PFS 
lists four debts, and he states he is making monthly payments totaling $250 to two of 
the four creditors. No payments to SOR creditors are indicated on his PFS. 
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy records show that his unsecured nonpriority debts were 
discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2010. (SOR ¶ 1.i; Item 
9) His debts were previously discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
October 1993. (Item 9)6  
                                            
4Applicant’s December 21, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject 
interview (PSI) is the source for the facts in this paragraph. (Item 6) 
 
5Applicant’s personal financial statement is the source for the facts in this paragraph. (Item 6)  
 
6Applicant’s SOR does not allege the 1993 bankruptcy. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR 
may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of mitigating information and explained that 
Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary 
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as 
appropriate.” (FORM at 9) Applicant’s FORM response repeats the information 
submitted in his SOR response.              
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
                                                                                                                                            
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Although the 1993 bankruptcy was cited in Applicant’s FORM, the 1993 bankruptcy will 
not be considered for any purpose because Applicant has not had adequate notice and a full opportunity 
to collect and present evidence of mitigation regarding this allegation.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM PSI, responses to DOHA interrogatories, SOR response, and 
FORM response. His delinquent nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged under 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2003. He subsequently accrued 12 
delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts, totaling $35,016. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all SOR debts; however, he provided some 
mitigating information. Applicant and his spouse’s illnesses and his mistake about his 
liability for the delinquency resulting from the voluntary repossession of his vehicle are 
all financial conditions largely beyond his control; however, he did not act responsibly 
under the circumstances. He did not provide specific information about any 
unemployment or changes in his income over the last five years to establish how the 
illnesses affected his income or debts. On December 21, 2011, the OPM investigator 
discussed Applicant’s delinquent debts with him; however, there has been no evidence 
of progress over the next two years. He failed to establish sufficient efforts to pay his 
creditors or otherwise resolve his delinquent debts and to provide documentation of 
such efforts to DOHA.   
 
Applicant did not explain why it was necessary to file bankruptcy in October 
2003. Applicant received financial counseling in connection with this bankruptcy in 
October 2003; however, there is no evidence of recent financial counseling.  
 
Applicant disputed his responsibility for the three delinquent, collection, or 
charged off medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($165), 1.k ($133), and 1.l ($417). I have 
credited Applicant with mitigating these three medical debts as they are likely the 
responsibility of his private medical insurance, although Applicant may owe some 
copays on these medical bills. Applicant receives some mitigation from his PFS, which 
shows a reasonable budget and an ample monthly remainder of $1,190. He also 
established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some good faith in 
the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting responsibility for 12 of his SOR debts.  
  
In sum, Applicant did not provide any documentation, such as checking account 
statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or 
made any payments to the following nine SOR creditors totaling $34,301 as follows: ¶ 
1.a ($18,436); ¶ 1.b ($1,055); ¶ 1.c ($612); ¶ 1.d ($118); ¶ 1.e ($461); ¶ 1.g ($497); ¶ 
1.h ($10,488); ¶ 1.j ($2,086); and ¶ 1.m ($548). There is no financial documentation 
relating to these nine SOR creditors as follows: financial counseling; maintenance of 
contact with creditors;8 correspondence to or from these creditors; credible debt 
                                            
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
disputes in light of his acceptance of responsibility in his SOR response; attempts to 
negotiate payment plans; or other evidence of progress or resolution of these nine SOR 
debts. There is insufficient evidence that his financial problems are being resolved, are 
under control, and will not occur in the future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant’s 
finances were adversely affected when he and his spouse suffered illnesses. He was 
also unaware that voluntary repossession of his vehicle could result in a large 
delinquent debt. These are two financial conditions largely beyond his control. He is 
credited with mitigating the three SOR medical debts in ¶¶ 1.f, 1.k, and 1.l. He has a 
reasonable budget and an ample monthly remainder of $1,190. He admitted 
responsibility for 12 of his SOR debts; however, he disputed three medical debts. There 
is no evidence of criminal conduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. He contributes to his 
company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he 
would intentionally violate national security.   
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His delinquent 
unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code 
                                                                                                                                            
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

in October 2003. Several debts on his SOR became delinquent more than five years 
ago. His largest delinquent debt resulted from the voluntary repossession of his vehicle 
in 2006. His PFS showed a remainder of $1,190, and he did not describe any payments 
to any SOR creditors, even though three of his SOR debts were less than $500. SOR ¶ 
1.d is $118; SOR ¶ 1.e is $461; and SOR ¶ 1.g is $497. He could have made greater 
progress resolving and documenting resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. He failed 
to mitigate nine delinquent SOR debts, totaling $34,301. Applicant’s SOR response and 
FORM response said he intended to resolve his delinquent debt by obtaining a 
bankruptcy discharge; however, he did not provide any proof that he had filed for 
bankruptcy. Not everyone who files for bankruptcy is able to successfully discharge their 
nonpriority unsecured debts. His failure to establish his financial responsibility shows 
lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.j:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
