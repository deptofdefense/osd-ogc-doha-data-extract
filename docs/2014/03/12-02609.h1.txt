MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant relied on consumer credit to cover living expenses and almost $12,000 in 
medical expenses. As of February 2014, he owed more than $30,000 in delinquent debt, 
which he planned to resolve in two years from the equity in his home. After his hearing, he 
began making $50 payments on six debts, but these recent payments are not sufficiently 
mitigating of his years of disregard of four court judgments and other collection debts. 
Clearance denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On November 12, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was 
unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security 
clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
 
 
 2 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on December 8, 2013, and he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On January 14, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him. On January 17, 2014, I scheduled a hearing for February 12, 
2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) and two 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant also 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 20, 2014. At Applicant’s 
request, I held the record open through March 12, 2014, for further evidentiary submissions 
from him. On March 10, 2014, Applicant submitted eight exhibits, which were entered into 
evidence as AEs C-J without objection. No additional exhibits were received by the 
deadline, so the record closed on March 12, 2014.  
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of November 12, 2013, Applicant owed 
four financial judgments totaling $23,396 (SOR 1.a-1.d); six collection debts totaling $8,146 
(SOR 1.e, 1.l-1.p); and six charged-off debts totaling $21,882 (SOR 1.f-1.k). Applicant 
admitted the debts and explained that they were incurred after he was diagnosed with a 
serious illness in 2008. He lost time at work and used credit cards for expenses not 
covered by insurance. Applicant expressed his intent to satisfy his debts from the equity in 
his home when he retires in two years. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 65-year-old senior engineer, who has worked for his current defense 
contractor employer since January 2005. Applicant previously worked for a different 
defense contractor on the same program from September 1982 to September 2004, when 
his then employer lost the government contract. (GE 1; Tr. 24.) Around 1983, he was 
granted a DOD Secret clearance, which was apparently administratively downgraded to a 
DOD Confidential security clearance in March 2000. (GEs 1, 2.) He seeks to retain a DOD 
Secret clearance, which was renewed around September 2005. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant has been married to his spouse since July 1975. They have two grown 
sons, who were born in November 1980 and January 1987. In September 2004, Applicant 
was laid off from his job of 22 years with a federal contractor in state X when the company 
lost the program contract to Applicant’s current employer. (GE 1; Tr. 24.) Applicant 
received 12 weeks of severance pay and otherwise supported his family on savings and 
 
 3 
unemployment compensation until January 2005, when he began working for his current 
employer in state Y. (GE 1; Tr. 35.) For the first six months, Applicant lived in a motel paid 
for by his employer. (GE 2.) In July 2005, Applicant and his spouse bought their present 
home for $370,000. (AE B.) They paid off the $280,000 mortgage on their previous home 
in state X and took on a mortgage of $296,000 for their new home, which they paid on 
time. (GE 3.) In August 2006, Applicant and his spouse took a vacation at their expense to 
Canada. (GE 2.) It is unclear how much the trip cost them. 
 
Around 2006, Applicant began covering some expenses for his father (e.g., 
telephone bill, car insurance), who battled a serious medical illness before his death in 
December 2010. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) Applicant’s older sister was living on disability income and 
could not help financially. (Tr. 28.) Applicant began to fall behind in his payments on an 
installment loan (SOR 1.c) and some charge accounts (SOR 1.g-1.k). In 2007, Applicant 
began incurring medical expenses of his own. After six months or so of medical testing, he 
was diagnosed with a serious medical illness, which required surgery in May 2008. 
Applicant lost time at work before and after his surgery, although he does not now recall 
the amount of lost income. (Tr. 51-53.) Applicant took cash advances from several of his 
consumer credit card accounts to pay about $12,000 in medical expenses not covered by 
insurance, and he relied on consumer credit for some daily expenses when he was out of 
work.
1
 (Tr. 17-19, 25-26.) He was on short-term disability after his operation.
2
 (Tr. 51.) 
 
 Applicant made no payments on several of his consumer credit accounts. In 
response to collection letters demanding payment in full, Applicant contacted his creditors, 
who advised him to file for bankruptcy or sell his home to pay off his debts. Applicant 
informed his creditors that they would be paid after he retired and sold his house. At the 
time, his home was worth less than what he owed on it. Some creditors continued to 
pursue collection, and between October 2007 and April 2008, four court judgments totaling 
$23,397 were entered against him. (GEs 2-5; Answer; Tr. 17-18, 29-32, 36.) 
 
In 2009, Applicant’s older sister was diagnosed with a serious illness, which proved 
terminal in June 2009. (Answer.) She was on Medicaid, and several of her prescriptions 
were not covered. Applicant helped his sister financially by paying between $200 and $400 
a few times so that she could see a physician specialist. (Tr. 18-19.) On occasion, 
Applicant paid his sister’s electric bill. He also bought items for his niece on credit. (Tr. 19, 
27-28.) Applicant kept no record of these expenditures. He took cash advances from his 
credit card accounts to provide for his sister. (Tr. 20.) 
 
 On October 27, 2011, Applicant executed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to the financial 
record inquiries, Applicant indicated that judgments and liens of $15,000 each had been 
                                                 
1 
Applicant testified that he was responsible for the first $3,000 and then 20% of the remaining balance. He 
had an operation that cost almost $32,000. (Tr. 19.)  He also had tests outside of the network that he had to 
cover at 100%. (Tr. 25.) Applicant did not keep track of his expenditures for his sister or for his father. (Tr. 20.) 
 
2 
Applicant testified that he was on sick leave and then short-term disability, which was at full-pay for eight 
weeks after a first week of “paid off-time.” (Tr. 51.) 
 
 
 4 
entered against him in the local court for delinquent Visa and MasterCard balances. His 
stated reason for the financial difficulty was “Family financial difficulties, sister, father and 
myself had cancer and had to borrow from credit cards.” 
 
 On November 15, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), partially about his finances. Applicant 
indicated that several liens have been placed on his home because of unpaid Visa and 
MasterCard delinquencies. Applicant disputed only an $87 collection debt (SOR 1.e), which 
was for Internet services that he did not receive. Applicant was unable to provide details 
about his undisputed debts. He added that the collection agencies were unwilling to enter 
into repayment arrangements with him, but that his creditors knew of his plan to satisfy his 
debts in full when he sells his home. Applicant expressed his belief that no one would 
question his willingness or ability to pay his debts or live within his means. He was current 
on his day-to-day living expenses. (GE 2.) 
 
 Applicant made no efforts to address his delinquent debts, as set forth in the 
following table.

In an undated letter to the creditor forwarding a March 6, 2014 $50 payment (AE E), Applicant indicated that 
the debt was around $6,593, which is the same amount as the judgment debt owed the creditor in SOR 1.d. 
The evidence is inconclusive about the judgment balance of SOR 1.b. 
 
4 
Applicant testified that most of the debts are now three or four times higher than the original balances due to 
interest. (Tr. 29.) His judgment creditors are apparently entitled to 12% interest annually on the unpaid 
balance. (Tr. 31.)

5 
The debt reportedly had a zero balance after transfer. It could have been purchased by the bank that 
acquired the $5,920 judgment in SOR 1.c (see AE I), although the account number for the debt in SOR 1.i 
does not match that of the debt in SOR 1.c on Applicant’s November 2011 credit report (see GE 3). 
 
6 
Applicant admitted all of the debts in the SOR. However, from the account numbers, it appears that some of 
the debts are duplicated in the SOR. The account number for the credit card debt in SOR 1.j matches that of a 
debt in collection with a balance of $10,615 as of February 2013. It is likely the same debt as the judgment in 
SOR 1.a (see AE H), although the original named creditors are not the same. The debt in SOR 1.g, which had 
a $10,614 balance as of October 2011, is likely an updated balance of the judgment debt in SOR 1.d.

 On March 1, 2013, the DOD CAF asked Applicant about his efforts to resolve his 
delinquent debts. He responded on May 16, 2013. With respect to the debts involved in the 
inquiry, including the previously disputed $87 debt, Applicant responded, “I have talked to 
creditor[s] and informed them that they will be paid when I retire in 2 years and sell our 
house. The money will come from equity in the house.” Applicant asked that the DOD CAF 
consider his “31-plus year” contributions to a military program without any security 
violations. Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) showing monthly net 
discretionary income of only $3 after paying the household living expenses and $50 a 
month toward one credit card, which had a $500 balance.
8
 Applicant reported zero bank 
savings. His home, on which he owed $260,000, was reportedly valued at $358,000. (GE 
2.) 
 
  Applicant was late in his home loan payment in December 2013, but for the most 
part, he has paid his mortgage on time. As of January 2014, the principal balance of his 
mortgage was $252,996. (AE A.) His residential property was valued around $386,500. (AE 
B.) There are currently seven liens against his home because of his nonpayment of his 
debts. (Tr. 32.) 
 
 At his February 2014 security clearance hearing, Applicant testified about his desire 
to make some payments toward his debts to show his good will to his creditors. He testified 
                                                 
7 
Applicant believes the credit card debt (SOR 1.k in collection in SOR 1.n) is one of the judgments. (GE 2.) It 
could be the judgment in SOR 1.b, but the evidence is unclear. 
 
8 
Applicant testified that his living expenses vary from month to month, so his net discretionary income is an 
estimate at best. (Tr. 41.)  
 
 7 
that his two sons were going to try and help him financially because he could not 
jeopardize his employment by continuing to do nothing about his debts. His younger son is 
a policeman and able to help him. (Tr. 41-42.) Applicant had trouble verifying who currently 
holds his accounts because some have been sold or collection activity transferred. (Tr. 20, 
39.) He did not know who held many of his accounts, and could not identify which 
accounts, if any, might be duplicated in the SOR. (Tr. 50.) He had about $800 in checking 
account deposits. (Tr. 44.) Applicant had one open credit card account, which he opened in 
August 2010. The account had a current balance of $355 as of February 2014. (AE C; Tr. 
54.) 
 
 On March 6, 2014, Applicant made $50 payments to six creditors. He expressed his 
intent to his creditors to continue to make payments on the debts until they are fully 
satisfied. (AEs D-J.) Applicant has had no financial counseling. (Tr. 34.) He has had no 
salary increases in the last three or four years. (Tr. 23-24.) Applicant also does not have a 
pension or any 401(k) assets. (Tr. 59.) 
 
 Applicant has held a security clearance for approximately 32 years without any 
evidence of any violations. Applicant does not access classified information in his duties, 
but he requires a security clearance to work in his building. (Tr. 38.) 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
 
 8 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Guideline F articulates several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG ¶ 
19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” are implicated by Applicant’s record of delinquent debts. The 
evidence establishes that Applicant had four financial judgments totaling $23,396 (SOR 
1.a-1.d) entered against him between October 2007 and April 2008. Due to accrued 
interest, Applicant could now owe as much as $31,584 on the accounts.
9
 At least seven 
other consumer credit accounts totaling $8,410 (SOR 1.e, 1.f. 1.h, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p) were 
charged off or placed for collection between 2006 and 2011.
10
  
 
                                                 
9 
The $7,432 judgment in SOR 1.a could now be as high as $10,615, which is the collection balance reported 
by the creditor in SOR 1.j. The collection agency for the $6,593 judgment creditor in SOR 1.d (duplicated in 
SOR 1.g) is reporting an unpaid balance of $11,558. 
 
10 
This $8,410 assumes that the $10,615 credit card debt in SOR 1.j is covered by the judgment in SOR 1.a; 
that the $11,558 credit card debt in SOR 1.g is the same debt as the judgment in 1.d; that SOR 1.k and 1.n 
are the same debt; that SOR 1.h and 1.o are the same debt; and that the debt in SOR 1.i is covered by the 
judgment in SOR 1.c. It has not been shown to represent an additional balance.   
 
 9 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” does not apply. While most 
of the debts (e.g., SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.h, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p) were incurred more than five years 
ago, AG ¶ 20(a) does not mitigate debts that have been long delinquent and are still 
outstanding. 
 
 Applicant explained that he had to rely on consumer credit cards to cover some 
living expenses and also about $12,000 in medical costs associated with treatment for a 
serious medical illness diagnosed in 2008. In addition, he aided his sister and father 
financially, although he kept no record of those expenditures. A medical emergency is a 
mitigating circumstance under AG ¶ 20(b): 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 Of the $12,000 in estimated expenditure for his own medical care, about $8,800 
would have been for his surgery in May 2008,
11
 so the surgery does not explain why he 
stopped paying on several consumer credit accounts in 2006. Even assuming the 
delinquencies were caused by having to pay for medically necessary care, such as 
diagnostic testing, and living expenses for him and close family members, it is difficult to 
find that he acted responsibly toward his creditors between 2011 and February 2014. His 
sister and father died in June 2009 and December 2010, respectively, so he should have 
been in a better position financially to begin to address his debts in 2011.  Applicant may 
have had lingering medical issues that led to lost time at work, but I cannot speculate about 
the extent of any income loss. Applicant’s response to his creditors’ demand for full 
payment, that he would pay his debt when he retires, could explain the lack of any 
settlement offers and the unwillingness of his creditors to work with him on his debts. 
Applicant’s years of disregard of four financial court judgments is not fully mitigated under 
AG ¶ 20(b). 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” are minimally established. Estimated market value for his 
residence and mortgage loan information shows that he has about $130,000 in equity in 
his home, provided he can sell it for around $386,000. While a potentially feasible plan to 
resolve his debts, a promise of satisfaction at some future date satisfies neither AG ¶ 20(c) 
nor AG ¶ 20(d). As of February 2014, Applicant intended to start repaying his debts as a 
show of his good faith, but he could not confirm who held his debts or their balances. On 
March 10, 2014, Applicant forwarded checks showing $50 payments on six debts along

for his $32,000 surgery.

with letters expressing his intent to continue payments. The checks had not yet cleared his 
account, although he had sufficient bank deposits ($800) as of his hearing to cover the 
checks. A single payment to a creditor is not enough to demonstrate a track record of 
repayment in light of his delinquency history. Applicant has not had any financial 
counseling, which could have alerted him to the importance of maintaining good credit. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies to those SOR allegations which were not shown to represent additional debt 
balances (SOR 1.g, 1.i., 1.j, 1.k, and 1.o). While Applicant had disputed the $87 telephone 
debt in SOR 1.e, he made a payment of $50 to the original creditor on March 6, 2014. (AE 
J). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
12
 
 
Applicant began falling behind in his debt payments in 2006. Available credit records 
show a date in 2006 for last activity on several accounts. Serious medical problems 
understandably placed a stress on Applicant’s finances around 2008 if not before then. 
The emotional toll caused by serious medical issues for him and close family members is 
partially extenuating of the delay in addressing debts incurred for medical care. The 
primary concern that persists is whether Applicant did all he could to address his 
delinquencies once the medical crises passed. As of his OPM interview in November 2011, 
Applicant knew he had liens on his residence for nonpayment of debts. He indicated that 
he tried to arrange for repayment, but the creditors were not willing to work with him. 
Applicant was unsure of who held his accounts. As of February 2014, he had taken little to 
no action to even determine updated balances of the court judgments. His disregard of 
these legitimate financial obligations is inconsistent with the sound judgment that must be 
demanded of persons with a DOD security clearance. 
 
The record was held open for him to submit evidence of any income loss, medical 
expenditures, creditor correspondence and contacts, debt payments, and other matters 
that could explain his years of inaction on his debts. After his hearing, he submitted 
evidence of letters to six of his creditors and checks drafted in the amount of $50 on March 
                                                 
12 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

6, 2014. He indicated in his letters that he would “keep sending money until this debt is fully 
paid off.” In making the whole-person assessment required under the Directive, the DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to 
resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant waited until just before the 
deadline for any further evidence to draft letters to his creditors. Available information does 
not show that the letters and checks had been mailed. Applicant could reasonably be 
expected to have acted with greater urgency to make those payments than he displayed. I 
do not doubt the sincerity of his stated intent to continue to make payments. His credibility 
is bolstered by his disclosure of his financial problems on his e-QIP. Yet, given his reported 
$3 in net discretionary income each month, it is difficult to see how he can afford to 
continue to make the promised payments without outside financial help. 
 
Applicant has held a security clearance for over 30 years with no apparent 
violations. Nonetheless, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an 
applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or 
renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 
1990). After considering the facts and circumstances before me in light of the adjudicative 
guidelines, I cannot conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance eligibility at this time.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
