GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 13, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On December 16, 2013, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
to her, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 6, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated 
January 15, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on February 11, 2014. The case was assigned to me on February 
14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 18, 2014, and amended on 
February 24, 2014. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on February 27, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and 28 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE AB) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 7, 2014. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She 
submitted ten additional documents, which were marked as exhibits (AE AC through AE 
AL) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on March 10, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.f. through 1.q.). 
Applicant’s answers and explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
February 2012, she has served as a facilities coordinator lead. She was previously a 
mail services clerk in Iraq, customer service representative, billing agent, and 
administrative specialist.2 Applicant was unemployed from February 2007 until May 
2007, and again from December 2011 until February 2012.3 She never served in the 
U.S. military.4 It is unclear if Applicant ever held a security clearance for she 
acknowledged that an investigation was conducted in early 2011, but there is no 
evidence that one was granted to her.5 She does not currently have a security 
clearance.6 Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in July 2007 and a master’s degree 
in business administration in March 2009.7 She was married August 1990, separated in

1994, and divorced in August 2007.8 Applicant has two children from that relationship (a 
daughter born in 1989 and a son born in 1991), as well as a son (born in 1996) from a 
different relationship that ended in 2009.9 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2007, when a 
series of events occurred, including losing her job, remaining unemployed for several 
months, obtaining only part-time employment, getting a divorce, terminating her 
relationship with her frequently unemployed cohabitant, raising three small school-age 
children, and not receiving child support from either her ex-husband or the father of her 
other child.10 Her annual income was immediately reduced from $40,000 in 2006 to 
under $20,000 in 2007.11 Neither she nor her husband wanted to pay for the divorce, so 
they remained separated for a number of years. Finally, once her financial situation 
enabled her to do so, she went ahead and paid for it herself.12 As of September 2013, 
her ex-husband owed her $71,955.93 in child support,13 and the father of her other child 
owed her $25,384.74 in child support.14 Applicant had some debts before 2007, but she 
managed to keep them current while she was employed. With her unemployment, she 
was forced to make some unspecified necessary financial “adjustments and sacrifices,” 
and eventually exhausted her 401(k) assets to support her family. She sought financial 
counseling from a local homeless coalition on a number of occasions between 2007 and 
2010, but her debts were simply too high for her income.15 Accounts became 
delinquent, placed for collection, or were charged off. Two judgments were entered, tax 
liens were filed, and a house was foreclosed. Applicant eventually approached her 
creditors and, when she had the necessary funds available, attempted to set up 
repayment plans where possible. 
The SOR identified 17 delinquent debts totaling $17,149 that had been placed for 
collection, charged off, went to foreclosure, or went to judgments and became tax liens, 
as generally reflected by a September 2013 credit report.16 Some accounts listed in the 
credit report have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit report, in some instances 
duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a

different creditor name. Several accounts are listed with only partial account numbers. 
Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the 
credit report, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
The debts listed in the SOR can be divided into four separate categories: (1) 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full; 
(2) those that are currently being paid under a repayment agreement; (3) those for 
which repayment plans and settlements have been discussed, but which payments 
have not yet commenced; and (4) various other accounts where the status is unclear.  
The largest number of accounts listed in the SOR fall within the first category - 
those which have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full. 
In 2009, there was a judgment entered and a state tax lien filed for $408, resulting from 
a miscalculation of education credits for the tax period 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.b.);17 there was a 
medical account for professional services in the amount of $258 that was erroneously 
reported to the credit reporting agency as delinquent (SOR ¶ 1.e.). Applicant disputed 
the adverse listing because her insurance explanation of benefits clearly states the 
patient responsibility is zero.18 There was a free cable service account that was part of 
an employment package that, unannounced, went into a charge status once Applicant 
left the employer. The unpaid balance was $242 (SOR ¶ 1.f.).19 There was a medical 
account for professional services in the amount of $100 (SOR ¶ 1.g.) that was settled 
for $80 and paid off in November 2013;20 there was a medical account for professional 
services in the amount of $145 (SOR ¶ 1.h.) that was settled for $116 and paid off in 
November 2013;21 there was a medical account for professional services in the amount 
of $29 (SOR ¶ 1.i.) that was settled for $23.20 and paid off in November 2013;22 there 
was a medical account for professional services in the amount of $38.34 (SOR ¶ 1.j.) 
that was settled for $30.67 and paid off in November 2013;23 there was an account with 
a discount tire distributor with a high credit of $974.66 that was sold to a debt purchaser 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.)24 which offered Applicant a settlement for the reduced amount of $584.78 
in 2011.25 A third-party collection agent indicated the account was settled in full.26 There

was a telephone and internet account in the amount of $257 (SOR ¶ 1.m.) that was 
settled for $128.65 and paid off in January 2014;27 and there was a medical account in 
the amount of $158 for professional services provided to Applicant’s son while Applicant 
was in Iraq (SOR ¶ 1.n.)28 and her family member with the power of attorney failed to 
inform the hospital that Applicant had insurance coverage. By the time Applicant 
learned about the account, the statute of limitations for submitting insurance claims had 
purportedly expired, and Applicant was required to make the payments directly to the 
hospital.29 The account was settled for $75 plus a $6 processing fee, and Applicant 
made her payment on January 8, 2014.30 The creditor has refused to furnish her with 
any documentation indicating the account has been satisfied.31 
 The second category - those accounts that are currently being paid under a 
repayment agreement, includes the following: in 2012, there was a judgment entered 
and a state tax lien filed for $1,479, resulting from a cancellation of Applicant’s overseas 
tax exemption when the base in Iraq at which she was serving closed and she was 
returned to the United States before she had been overseas long enough to qualify for 
the exemption (SOR ¶ 1.a.).32 She entered into a repayment plan in November 2012 – 
over a year before the SOR was issued – and has been making monthly payments of 
$50 since that time.33 As of January 2014, the balance has been reduced to $853.44;34 
in 2012, there was a miscalculation of her 2011 overseas income withholding, resulting 
in a tax deficiency owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $1,135 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.).35 In August 2012, Applicant approached the IRS and a repayment plan 
was established, under which she agreed to a monthly direct debit installment payment 
of $50.36 Commencing September 2012, she made a payment of $153, and each month

thereafter, made $50 payments.37 As of January 2014, the balance has been reduced to 
$998.72, including penalty and interest.38 There was vehicle loan account for a car that 
Applicant purchased for about $27,064 and later transferred the registration to her 
brother, who promised to take over the loan payments. He failed to do so, and the 
vehicle, with a past-due balance of $4,824 (SOR ¶ 1.o.), was charged off and sold to a 
debt purchaser.39 The vehicle was repossessed while Applicant was in Iraq, but her 
brother never informed her of either the delinquency or the repossession.40 A third-party 
collection agent offered Applicant a settlement in the amount of $1,549.95 in March 
2014,41 and Applicant authorized that collection agent to automatically deduct $309.99 
per month from her bank account for five months, beginning on March 7, 2014.42 
 
 The third category - those accounts for which repayment plans and settlements 
may have been discussed, but payments under those plans may not have yet 
commenced, includes the following: there is a department store account with an 
outstanding balance of $1,041.83 (SOR ¶ 1.q.)43 which was settled for $521 with the 
understanding that automatic monthly payments of $43 would be withdrawn from 
Applicant’s bank account commencing April 2, 2014.44 
The fourth category - various other accounts where the status is unclear, 
includes the following: there is a medical account for professional services in the 
amount of $75 (SOR ¶ 1.d.) for which the collection agent is unable or unwilling to 
furnish Applicant any documentation.45 Applicant informally disputed the account and 
contends that at the time of the service, she had medical insurance and was deployed. 
She believes the account is a duplicate of another account, but without further 
information, she is unable to substantiate her belief. The collection agent offered her 
only two payment options; send a check in the mail or make a payment over the 
telephone.46 The parties are at an impasse, and the account has not been resolved. 
There was a department store account with a high credit of $395 and outstanding 
balance of $523.00 that was past due $101 when it was charged off (SOR ¶ 1.l.).47 
Applicant contacted the creditor and was informed that $523.49 was charged off in

2010, and because of the statute of limitations, no further collection efforts or repayment 
arrangements could be made.48 Although Applicant indicated a willingness to resolve 
the account, it is unclear as to what steps she will take to do so. The account has not 
been resolved. There is a bank credit card with a high credit and unpaid balance of 
$5,463 that was $1,221 past due and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.p.).49 Applicant contended 
that before the account was charged off, she had a repayment arrangement in place 
with a collection agent and was making monthly payments of $100 when the actual 
account balance was $7,685.19.50 She has not submitted any documentation to support 
her contentions. Applicant subsequently submitted documentation related to another 
credit card with the same bank, but the account number reflected in the documentation 
differs from the one listed in the credit report.51 There is no evidence that the two 
accounts are the same, or that the SOR account has been resolved. 
 Applicant reduced her expenses in several areas, including rent (by sharing an 
apartment with a roommate), phone bill, and recalculated and reduced student loan 
payments. Once an account is paid off, she intends to apply the newly available funds 
to her remaining accounts.52 At the end of each month, she estimates that she has 
between $200 and $300 remaining available for discretionary savings or expenditures.53

 The quality safety and continuance improvement manager, a retired Army 
sergeant major, has worked with Applicant and believes she is a “great asset and 
trusted employee.” He has personally assisted her since 2012 in straightening out her 
finances. He would trust Applicant with the nation’s secrets.54  Applicant’s manager has 
rated her work performance for two years, and he is very supportive of her application. 
Applicant has been described as extremely pleasant and helpful, with excellent 
motivation, drive, and abilities. “Her willingness to continually go beyond what is 
required marks her as a role model for others to emulate. She is a very positive 
employee who is a real joy to work with.”55

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”56 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”57   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”58 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.59  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”60 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”61 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In 2007, Applicant found herself with little assets to continue making 
her routine monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent and were placed 
for collection or charged off. Two judgments were eventually entered, and tax liens were 
filed. One house was lost to foreclosure. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.

The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.62 In addition, if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 
20(e) may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. AG ¶ 20(e) 
does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing 
financial difficulties since 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” 
or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, and she did not spend beyond her means. Instead, her financial 
problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. Commencing in 2007, Applicant 
started experiencing some financial difficulties when a series of events occurred, 
including losing her job, remaining unemployed for several months, obtaining only part-
time employment, getting a divorce, terminating her relationship with her frequently 
unemployed cohabitant, raising three small school-age children, and not receiving child 
support from either her ex-husband or the father of her other child. Because of her 
unemployment, her annual income was immediately reduced from $40,000 in 2006 to 
under $20,000 in 2007. As of September 2013, her ex-husband owed her $71,955.93 in 
child support, and the father of her other child owed her $25,384.74 in child support. 
With her unemployment, she was forced to make some unspecified necessary financial 
“adjustments and sacrifices,” and eventually exhausted her 401(k) assets to support her 
                                                          
62
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

family. She sought financial counseling from a local homeless coalition on a number of 
occasions between 2007 and 2010, but her debts were simply too high for her income.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing nearly all of her delinquent accounts, 
and working with her creditors.63 Of the 17 SOR-debts, the vast majority of those debts 
have already been resolved, either through settlement or by payment in full. Other debts 
are in repayment plans, and Applicant has either commenced making the required 
payments, or is about to do so.  The status of three accounts remains unclear, but it 
appears that Applicant is still attempting to resolve them. With her current job, there are 
clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s 
actions under the circumstances confronting her, do not cast doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.64 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.65       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Her handling of 
her finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
                                                          
63
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

accounts were placed for collection or charged off. One property went to foreclosure, 
and two judgments resulted in tax liens.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and she did not spend beyond her means. Rather, her problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. Her financial difficulties were generated when she lost her job, 
remained unemployed for several months, obtained only part-time employment, got a 
divorce after a lengthy separation, terminated her relationship with her frequently 
unemployed cohabitant, raised three small school-age children, and did not receive 
child support from either her ex-husband or the father of her other child. If Applicant had 
received the $97,340.67 in child support her ex-husband and the father of her other 
child owed her, she would not be in debt, and none of her accounts would have become 
delinquent. All but 3 of the 17 SOR-debts have been paid off, settled, or otherwise 
resolved, or are in the process of being resolved. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting her do not cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:66 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I

conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
