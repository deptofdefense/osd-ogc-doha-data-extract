GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 13, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On August 26, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set of interrogatories. She 
responded to the interrogatories on September 13, 2013.2 On October 25, 2013, the 
DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information

(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on November 6, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
November 22, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2013. The case was assigned to me on 
January 17, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 3, 2014, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on February 26, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and 25 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE Y) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and two other witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 7, 2014. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. She submitted four additional documents, which were marked as 
exhibits (AE Z through AE CC) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record 
closed on March 7, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.h.). Applicant’s 
answers and explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, 
I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
May 2013, she has served as a senior systems applications (SAP) and products 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) analyst. She was previously a customer service 
representative, a quality assurance analyst, process improvement and quality 
assurance, SAP production support, and competency center quality assurance 
support.3 Applicant was included in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) contractor workforce layoff and was unemployed from May 2011 until May 
2012.4 She never served in the U.S. military.5 She has never held a security clearance.6

Applicant received an associate’s degree in August 1986 and a bachelor’s degree in 
December 1990.7 She has never been married.8  
 
Financial Considerations 
Applicant worked in support of NASA from 1985 until 2011, and by the time she 
was laid off in May 2011, she was earning approximately $150,000 per year. In 2002, 
being financially secure in her job, she developed a life-long horse hobby into an equine 
breeding business as a sideline. She purchased several rental houses and built the 
facility on a ten and one-half acre site, stocked it with three stallions and several brood 
mares, and over the next several years, purchased additional adjacent land, purchased 
equipment, and hired employees. At one point, she had 55 horses in her facility. In 
2006, Applicant expanded her operation with the intention of producing and selling an 
increased number of foals per year. The production doubled from 6 to 12 foals. The 
acreage was up to about 120 acres.9  
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2007 – 2008, 
when “the bottom fell out of the economy” and people starting decreasing their 
expenditures on luxuries like hunt clubs and thoroughbreds.10 Renters were unable to 
continue making their monthly rental payments, and either moved out or were evicted. 
Her horses still had to eat and be maintained. During this period, while loading horses, 
Applicant was injured when she was “slam-dunked” into the ground, resulting in her 
requiring neck surgery and being somewhat incapacitated for seven or eight months.11 
Nevertheless, while the economy raised some financial issues, Applicant was able to 
handle her finances and pay her bills until shortly after she was laid off in May 2011.12 
Her monthly income was immediately reduced to $1,000 in unemployment 
compensation. She contacted her banker, her accountant, and a bankruptcy attorney, 
and obtained a credit report.13 She immediately set about to avoid delinquencies, and 
by August 2011, Applicant had sold off 63 acres of her property and one of the rental 
houses. She was unable to sell her home, 32 acres, and the remaining three rental 
houses because an auction failed to materialize bids to cover the loans, so she 
refinanced where she could.14 She raised her insurance deductibles and dropped less 
critical policies to reduce her financial obligations. She sold all non-essential farm

equipment and laid off two full-time and three part-time employees.15 Until she could 
secure another good job, she accepted a much lower paying job with an equine hospital 
about 70 miles away in another state, where she earned $24,000 per year.16 By April or 
May 2012, Applicant had exhausted all of her assets. She had a minimal salary, was 
unable to sell horses because of market conditions, and could not address her 
remaining debts. As a result, accounts became delinquent, placed for collection, or were 
charged off. One real estate property was lost to foreclosure. 
In September 2013, Applicant provided a personal financial statement reflecting 
a monthly net income of $3,070.13; monthly household, business, utility, transportation, 
and food expenses of $1,813; and monthly debt payments of $983.50; leaving a 
monthly remainder of $273.63 available for discretionary savings or expenditures.17 In 
addition to Applicant’s net income, she noted that she generally judges four to six horse 
shows per year, averaging $400 per day, and that she sells an occasional horse for 
between $500 and $3,500 per sale.18 
The SOR identified eight delinquent debts totaling $156,325 that had been 
placed for collection, charged off, or went to foreclosure, as generally reflected by a May 
2013 credit report19 and an August 2013 credit report.20 Some accounts listed in the 
credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in some 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. Several accounts are listed with only partial account 
numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according 
to the credit reports, evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) There is bank home equity line of credit (also referred to as a 
second mortgage) with a credit limit of $45,000 that was past due in the amount of 
$44,384.21 Applicant managed to remain current on the account until May 2012.22 At 
some point in 2012, a modified loan schedule was adopted when the bank would not 
agree to refinance the account until the lender holding the first mortgage agreed to 
refinance the first mortgage.23 Applicant continued to make her modified payments until

the refinance could occur. The original note matured and was discharged,24 and on 
December 12, 2013, the bank refinanced the by-then $45,502.72 loan. Under the terms 
of the new promissory note, Applicant is to pay $377.85 per month until December 
2028.25 She is current on her new payments.26 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.) There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $16,000 and a 
past-due balance of $3,399 that was placed for collection and charged off.27 Applicant 
managed to remain current on the account until April or May 2012.28 She attempted to 
work out a modified payment plan but the bank servicing the account refused to do so.29 
In January 2014, a new collection agency agreed to a settlement. Applicant paid the 
agreed settlement of $1,700 in January 2014, and the account was considered paid 
off.30 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is bank unsecured line of credit with a credit limit of $10,000 
that was initially past due in the amount of $1,648, and charged off in January 2013.31 
Applicant managed to remain current on the account until April or May 2012.32 She 
attempted to renegotiate a new payment schedule, but her efforts were refused.33 Once 
she obtained her new position, she approached the collection agent, and they offered to 
settle the account for $6,882.88, but she was unable to make a lump-sum payment of 
that amount.34 She subsequently contacted the next collection agent, and in January 
2014, a new settlement was offered, in the amount of $5,407.97, and a repayment plan 
was approved.35 Under the terms of the repayment agreement, Applicant made an initial 
electronic debit payment of $901.27, plus a $8.95 processing fee, on January 31, 
2014.36 The second payment was made two days after the hearing, and the final

payment is expected to be made on June 30, 2014.37 The account is in the process of 
being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a home mortgage account on Applicant’s residence with a 
high credit of $292,000, and an unpaid balance of $242,952, that was past due in the 
amount of $19,271.38 Applicant approached the lender and entered into a Home 
Affordable Unemployment Program (HAUP) under which she made modified loan 
payments ($355.88 per month) for a year.39 In October 2013, Applicant entered into the 
Home Affordable Modification Trial Period Plan under which her monthly payments 
increased to $453.13.40 In January 2014, she was enrolled into the Home Affordable 
Modification Program (HAMP), and the loan agreement was automatically modified, 
effective March 1, 2014.41 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) There is a home mortgage account on one of Applicant’s rental 
properties with a high credit of $54,400 that became past due and was placed for 
collection.42 When Applicant had insufficient income to maintain the mortgage payments 
and was unable to rent the property, she agreed to relinquish the deed to the lender in 
lieu of foreclosure. The title transfer occurred in October 2012.43 A Form 1099-C 
(Cancellation of Debt) was issued in January 2013, reflecting the amount of the debt 
discharged was $50,679.77.44 Although the Warranty Deed clearly states that the 
parties agreed on the amount of the indebtedness ($55,392.47, including principal, 
interest, and expenses) that was to be credited to Applicant for the conveyance of the 
title,45 the lender mistakenly reported to the credit reporting agencies that there was a 
$13,315 deficiency balance still owed by Applicant.46 According to the senior credit 
officer at the lender, “once the bank accepted the property deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, I 
believe the balance of the loan should have been satisfied. . . . We will work diligently to

credit report as zero.48 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.) There is a home mortgage account on another of Applicant’s rental 
properties with a high credit of $57,000 that became past due and was placed for 
collection.49 When Applicant had insufficient income to maintain the mortgage payments 
and was unable to rent the property, she agreed to relinquish the deed to the lender in

Although the Warranty Deed clearly states that the parties agreed on the amount of the 
indebtedness ($53,040.69, including principal, interest, and expenses) that was to be

resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.) There is a home mortgage account on another of Applicant’s rental 
properties with a high credit of $45,000 that became past due and was placed for 
collection.56  She explored a loan modification with the lender, but her efforts were 
rejected. Instead, the lender advised her that it was unable to work with her until she 
was two or three months behind in her payments.57 Applicant made partial payments, 
but because they were not complete payments, they were not credited to her account.58

(Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property) that was issued that month, 
reflecting the amount of the debt discharged was $42,222.79.60 The February 2014 
Equifax credit report reflects a zero balance.61 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.) There is a credit card account with a high credit of $15,495 and a 
past due balance of $10,187 that was placed for collection and charged off.62 She 
attempted to work out a modified payment plan but the bank servicing the account 
refused to do so.63 Instead, Applicant was advised that she had to be in arrears for over 
two months before any agreements could be made. At the end of the period, the bank 
only informally agreed verbally to accept reduced payments until she could return to the 
full payment schedule.64 She made a variety of payments, ranging from $10 to $50, with 
the most recent one made in February 2014.65 Applicant’s intention is to increase her 
monthly payments once she has satisfied the account set forth in SOR ¶ 1.c. The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
Character References 
 
 The president of the local bank first met Applicant through fox hunting, but 
subsequently assisted her in financing various real estate transactions over the years. 
They confer on a regular basis to discuss her liabilities and efforts to resolve her 
financial situation. On a couple of occasions they have discussed bankruptcy, but 
Applicant was “absolutely opposed to it.”66 He attributed that financial situation to two 
major factors. In the beginning of 2008, the entire economy deteriorated and Applicant’s 
side business of raising very expensive thoroughbred horses was affected just like the 
rest of the luxury market - beach houses, country clubs, and other expensive hobby-
type businesses. The other factor was her being laid off. Until the lay-off, he contends 
Applicant was “able to hold things together.”67 Applicant’s general reputation in the 
community is that of being trustworthy, reliable, and diligent in her affairs.68

The retired dean of the college of liberal arts has known Applicant for nearly 40 
years since Applicant first trained her and her horse for various horse shows. They are 
in the same circle of friends. Applicant has a strong reputation within the community for 
honesty and integrity.69  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”70 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”71   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”72 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.73  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”74 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”75 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In about April or May 2012, Applicant found herself with little assets 
to continue making her routine monthly payments and various accounts became 
delinquent, and were placed for collection or charged off. One real estate property was 
lost to foreclosure. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.76 In addition, if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 
20(e) may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2012 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and she did not spend beyond her means. Instead, her financial problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control. Commencing in about 2007 - 2008, Applicant started 
experiencing some financial difficulties when the bottom fell out of the economy and 
expenditures on luxury items like horses and hunt clubs started decreasing. In addition, 
she was injured and became somewhat incapacitated for seven or eight months. While 
                                                          
76
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

those factors raised some financial issues, Applicant was able to handle her finances 
and pay her bills until another significant factor occurred: she was laid off in May 2011, 
and her monthly income plummeted to $1,000 in unemployment compensation.  
Applicant contacted her creditors, her banker, her accountant, and a bankruptcy 
attorney, and obtained a credit report. In an effort to avoid delinquencies, she reduced 
her financial obligations and sold off 63 acres of her property and one of the rental 
houses. She was unable to sell her home, 32 acres, and the remaining three rental 
houses because an auction failed to materialize bids to cover the loans, so she 
refinanced where she could. She raised her insurance deductibles and dropped less 
critical policies; sold all non-essential farm equipment; and laid off employees. She 
accepted a much lower paying job with an equine hospital about 70 miles away in 
another state, where she earned $24,000 per year. By April or May 2012, Applicant had 
exhausted all of her assets. She had minimal salary, was unable to sell horses because 
of market conditions, and could not address her remaining debts. As a result, accounts 
became delinquent, placed for collection, or were charged off. One real estate property 
was lost to foreclosure. 
She explored bankruptcy, but was opposed to it. Instead, Applicant acted 
responsibly by addressing her delinquent accounts, and working with her creditors.77 
With the assistance of her mortgage lenders, she refinanced her home mortgage under 
HAUP and HAMP, as well as her second mortgage, and both of those mortgages are 
now current. She relinquished the deeds to two rental properties to the mortgage lender 
in lieu of foreclosure, receiving Forms 1099-C in return, without incurring any 
deficiencies. She relinquished a deed to another rental property as part of a foreclosure, 
and received a Form 1099-A, without incurring a deficiency. With regard to AG ¶ 20(e), 
the credit reports reflected three deficiencies resulting from the two deed transfers in 
lieu of foreclosure, and the one actual foreclosure. Those reports were in error. The 
senior credit officer at the lender for two of the transactions acknowledged the error was 
caused by the lender, and there was no deficiency incurred, contrary to the allegations 
in the SOR. The foreclosure of the third rental property also was without any deficiency. 
Applicant paid off one credit card and is currently making agreed payments on another 
credit card, so those accounts are either resolved or in the process of being resolved. 
She entered into a repayment plan for her unsecured line of credit, and is making the 
agreed monthly payments on an account that should be resolved in June 2014. 
Applicant has resolved all of her non-SOR accounts, and is now current on all of her 
SOR accounts. With her current job, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting 
her, do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.78

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.79       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Her handling of 
her finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off. One rental property went to 
foreclosure.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and she did not spend beyond her means. Rather, her problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. In about 2007 - 2008, the bottom fell out of the economy and 
expenditures on luxury items like horses and hunt clubs started decreasing, having an 
impact on her outside earnings. In addition, Applicant was injured and became 
somewhat incapacitated for seven or eight months. While Applicant started 
experiencing some financial difficulties when those events occurred, she was able to 
handle her finances and pay her bills. But, in May 2011, she was laid off, and her 
monthly income plummeted to $1,000 in unemployment compensation. In an effort to 
avoid delinquencies, she reduced her financial obligations and, among other actions, 
sold off some real estate, sold all non-essential farm equipment, and laid off employees. 
She also accepted a much lower paying job which paid her $24,000 per year. She 
managed to survive financially for another year, but by May 2012, all of her assets had 
been exhausted. Applicant eventually secured another, better-paying position, and she 
has paid off, settled, or otherwise resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all of her

accounts, including non-SOR accounts and those accounts appearing in the SOR. 
There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting her do not cast doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:80 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
