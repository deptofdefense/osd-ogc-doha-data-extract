GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 22, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On October 22, 2013, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under

Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could 
not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 24, 2013. In a statement, notarized 
November 12, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, supported by 
documentation, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 On November 14, 2013, he submitted an amended response to the SOR, and 
furnished additional documentation.3 A complete copy of the Government’s file of 
relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on December 6, 2013, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the 
FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as “the ‘Guidelines’ 
applicable to [his] case.”4 It appears, however, that the version of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines furnished was an outdated, superseded version of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.5 The result of that action was that Applicant may have relied on modified, but 
incorrect, adjudicative guidelines when he responded to the SOR. While it does not 
appear that the error was ever corrected, in his February 2014 response to the FORM, 
he did refer to the correct AG, and the issue has been minimized. Applicant received the 
FORM on December 20, 2013, and he submitted responses on January 6, 2014, and 
February 14, 2014. By letter, dated March 11, 2014, Department Counsel did not object 
to the response. The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., and 1.d. through 1.f.). 
Applicant’s admissions and other comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a field service representative since April 2013. He was previously employed 
as an aircraft inspector, and an airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic.6 He was 
unemployed from September 2012 until April 2013, when the airline he worked for went

into bankruptcy.7 Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Army National 
Guard (ANG) from May 1969 until May 1971, and was administratively discharged 
under honorable conditions with a general discharge certificate due to unsuitability.8 He 
received an associate’s degree in June 1972, and attended a community college for 
seven additional months, but did not obtain another degree.9 Applicant was married in 
September 1987, and divorced in April 2002.10 He has one son, born in October 1993.11 
He has never held a security clearance.12 
 
Financial Considerations13 
 
 There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until he went through a 
financially distressing divorce process in 2001 – 2002, and then incurred unexpectedly 
large medical bills in 2003, resulting from his affliction with kidney stones.14 Additional 
financial problems occurred when his employer went bankrupt and Applicant became 
unemployed in September 2012. He remained unemployed until April 2013. He had 
previously enjoyed “very good credit” until 2001.15 At some point, because of insufficient 
money to continue making all of his monthly payments, some of his accounts became 
delinquent, placed for collection, or were charged off. Two accounts went to judgment. 
He contacted his creditors and, when he was able to do so, he entered into repayment 
arrangements or settled some accounts for less than the full amount. In an effort to 
address his remaining accounts, when Applicant obtained his current position, he 
immediately volunteered for a potentially dangerous overseas deployment to generate 
additional salary.16  
 
The SOR identified seven delinquent debts totaling $12,313 that had been 
placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment, as generally reflected by a May 
2013 credit report17 and a September 2013 credit report.18 Some accounts listed in the

 Other than two credit reports furnished by Department Counsel, Applicant’s submissions serve as the only 
other source of the information in evidence, for the file does not contain any interrogatories, personal subject 
interview, or a personal financial statement. An investigation was performed by the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), but no portion of the report of investigation (ROI) is included in the FORM. Also troubling is that 
Applicant indicated he had enclosed several documents along with his February 14, 2014 submission, but those 
documents are not in the FORM.

credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in some 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. Several accounts are listed with only partial account 
numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according 
to the credit reports, evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding the same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) There is an account with an automobile rental company in the 
amount of $102 for automobile insurance that Applicant’s former employer (the bankrupt 
airline), after the fact, refused to pay. Applicant explained his predicament to the creditor 
and even offered to settle the account for 50 percent, but the creditor refused.19 
Applicant both disputed and admitted the allegation, and acknowledged that he is willing 
to pay the balance.20 The account is not listed in either of the 2013 credit reports, and 
while it is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet 
the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations under ¶ E3.1.14 of 
the Directive for pertinent allegations, the absence of any such credit report adverse 
information should be considered in a positive light.21 Furthermore, the source of the 
allegation is unclear. Nevertheless, it appears that this account has not yet been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.) There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $3,200 and 
high credit of $3,807 that was acquired by a larger bank and subsequently placed for 
collection before it was sold to a debt purchaser.22 In October 2012, that debt purchaser 
obtained a default judgment against Applicant in the amount of $4,015.23 In September 
2013, the debt purchaser offered to settle the account for $2,800,24 and on October 7, 
2013, Applicant’s attorney forwarded a check in that amount to the debt purchaser.25 On 
November 6, 2013, a Satisfaction of Judgment was filed in the court, and any cause of 
action against Applicant was waived and discontinued with prejudice.26 The account has 
been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is a bank credit card account with an unspecified credit limit 
or high credit that was placed for collection before it went to judgment against Applicant 
in the amount of $1,974 in September 2010.27 In September 2013, Applicant’s attorney 
forwarded a check to the creditor, and on October 2, 2013, a Satisfaction of Judgment 
was filed in the court, announcing that the judgment had been “wholly satisfied.”28 The 
account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $2,500 and 
high credit of $2,555 that was past due $2,653 when it was placed for collection and 
charged off.29 Applicant contends the account was closed and settled for less than the 
full amount,30 but it is unclear if he had submitted any documentation to support that 
there was a settlement for any amount, or that there were any payments made. In this 
regard, in his February 14, 2014 Response to the FORM, Applicant indicated that he 
had enclosed several photocopies of Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt), two of which 
were related to his accounts with this particular creditor (the same creditor identified in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.), to show that the accounts were settled for less than the full 
amount.31 Those documents were not included in the FORM, and in the absence of 
such documentation, it is impossible to determine if the documents refer to this 
particular account. Although he indicated it has been his intention to fully pay the 
account when he is financially able to do so, he also believes this “older debt” should no 
longer be listed on his credit report.32 It remains unclear if the account has been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $1,000 and 
high credit of $1,219 that was past due $1,259 when it was placed for collection and 
charged off.33 Applicant contends the account was closed and settled for less than the 
full amount,34 but it is unclear if he had submitted any documentation to support that 
there was a settlement for any amount, or that there were any payments made. In this 
regard, see my comments above regarding the Form 1099-C. Although he indicated it 
has been his intention to fully pay the account when he is financially able to do so, he 
also believes this is another “older debt” that should no longer be listed on his credit 
report.35 It remains unclear if the account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.f.) There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $1,000 and 
high credit of $1,233 that was past due $1,556 when it was placed for collection and 
charged off.36 Applicant contends the account was closed and settled for less than the 
full amount,37 but it is unclear if he had submitted any documentation to support that 
there was a settlement for any amount, or that there were any payments made. In this 
regard, see my comments above regarding the Form 1099-C. Although he indicated it 
has been his intention to fully pay the account when he is financially able to do so, he 
also believes this is another “older debt” that should no longer be listed on his credit 
report.38 It remains unclear if the account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.) There is a regional hospital medical account with a past-due 
balance of $754.53 that was placed for collection in March 2013.39 Applicant attributed 
the unpaid balance to the fact that his former bankrupt employer’s insurance failed to 
cover the medical procedures he received.40 Applicant paid the collection attorney $100 
on May 28, 2013, and $754.53 on August 16, 2013.41 He received a refund of $100 in 
September 2013.42 The account has been resolved. 
 
 There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial 
counseling. 
 
 Department Counsel noted that despite alleged financial hardships, Applicant 
had managed to take annual trips to a particular Caribbean island from 2008 through 
2012.43 Applicant explained that he took those trips while he was employed by two 
airlines, and the airfare was free. The sole purpose of the trips was to visit and bond 
with his only child.44 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”45 As Commander in Chief,

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”46   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”49 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. While Applicant occasionally experienced some degree of financial 
difficulties between 2001 and 2012, at some point after September 2012, he found 
himself with insufficient funds to continue making his routine monthly payments and 
various accounts became delinquent, and were placed for collection or charged off. Two 
accounts went to judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG

¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.51  
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2012 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were substantially beyond 
Applicant’s control. Commencing in about 2001 - 2002, Applicant started experiencing 
some financial difficulties when he went through a financially distressing divorce 
process. He was divorced in 2003. He also incurred unexpectedly large medical bills 
when he underwent treatment for kidney stones. His main financial problems arose 
when his employer went bankrupt and Applicant became unemployed. He remained 
unemployed until April 2013. During that period, some accounts became delinquent, 
placed for collection, or were charged off. Two accounts went to judgment. Applicant 
contacted his creditors and, when he was able to do so, he entered into repayment 
arrangements or settled some accounts for less than the full amount. In an effort to 
address his remaining accounts, when Applicant obtained his current position, he 
immediately volunteered for a potentially dangerous overseas deployment to generate

Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts and working 
with his creditors.52 With the assistance of an attorney, he focused on two of his three

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

largest accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.) and resolved them. He also paid off his 
delinquent medical account (SOR ¶ 1.g.). There were also three credit card accounts 
with the same creditor (SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.). Applicant contends the accounts 
were closed and settled for less than the full amount, but it is unclear if he had 
submitted any documentation to support that there were settlements for any amounts, 
or that there were any payments made. As noted above, in his February 14, 2014 
Response to the FORM, Applicant indicated that he had enclosed several photocopies 
of Form 1099-C, two of which were related to his accounts with this particular creditor, 
to show that the accounts were settled for less than the full amount. Those documents 
were not included in the FORM, and in the absence of such documentation, it is 
impossible to determine if the documents refer to these particular accounts. The FORM 
did not address the absence of the claimed submissions. Applicant has apparently 
resolved all of his non-SOR accounts. In addition, he has definitely resolved three of the 
seven SOR accounts, is willing to resolve another small SOR account, and has possibly 
resolved the remaining three SOR accounts. With his current job, while there is no 
evidence that he has ever received financial counseling, there are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.53 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.54

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off. Two accounts went to judgment.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and, despite the assertions of Department Counsel that he found money for recreation in 
the Caribbean rather than for paying his bills, he did not spend beyond his means. 
Rather, his problems were substantially beyond Applicant’s control. Commencing in 
about 2001 - 2002, Applicant started experiencing some financial difficulties when he 
went through a financially distressing divorce process. He was divorced in 2003. He also 
incurred unexpectedly large medical bills when he underwent treatment for kidney 
stones. His main financial problems arose when his employer went bankrupt and in 
September 2012, Applicant became unemployed. He remained unemployed until April 
2013. Applicant eventually secured another position, and he immediately volunteered for 
a potentially dangerous overseas deployment to generate additional salary. He has paid 
off, settled, or otherwise resolved, or is in the process of resolving, nearly all of his 
accounts, including his non-SOR accounts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. The entire situation occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:55 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue 
his debt resolution efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his 
future eligibility for a security clearance.56 Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005);
