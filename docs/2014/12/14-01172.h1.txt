Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 16 delinquent collection or 
charged-off debts for $18,887. Her debts resulted from unemployment, medical 
problems, and underemployment. She paid one debt for $1,800. She paid $3,500 to 
address her student loans. She paid some non-SOR debts. She has a track record of 
paying her debts. She committed to paying her remaining debts. Financial 
considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 6, 2013, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (GE 1)1 On May 1, 2014, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-
R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the 
                                            
1 Applicant’s SF 86 indicates she received inpatient emotional or psychiatric treatment from 
September 2011 to April 2012 and from August 2013 to December 2013. (GE 1) The SOR did not 
indicate that her underlying medical or emotional condition raised a security concern, and it was not 
discussed during her hearing.

adjudicative guidelines (AG) as revised by the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligence on August 30, 2006, which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (HE 2) 
DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such 
access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) On 
October 15, 2014, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On October 20, 2014, 
the case was assigned to me. On November 17, 2014, DOHA issued a hearing notice, 
setting the hearing for November 20, 2014. The hearing was held as scheduled. 
Applicant had more than 15 days of de facto notice of the hearing. (Tr. 17) Moreover, 
she waived her right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing and 
asked to proceed with her hearing without delay. (Tr. 16-17) At hearing, Department 
Counsel offered two exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 19-20; GE 1-2) 
Applicant said she mailed three letters to DOHA for inclusion in the record. (Tr. 12-13) 
On December 3, 2014, I received the transcript of the hearing. On December 8, 2014, I 
received seven documents from Applicant (includes Department Counsel’s email and 
Applicant’s fax cover sheet as separate exhibits), which were admitted without 
objection. (Tr. 47-48; AE A-G)   
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.p, and she provided extenuating and mitigating information. Her admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old customer service representative employed by a 
defense contractor to assist with medical records. (Tr. 6, 28) In 2003, she graduated 
from high school. (Tr. 6) She attended college full time for three years, majored in 
psychology, but did not receive a degree. (Tr. 7, 22) She has not served in the military. 
(Tr. 7) She has never been married; however, she has a 17-month-old son. (Tr. 7) Her 
fiancé, her son, and Applicant live together. (Tr. 27, 35) There is no evidence of 
reportable criminal offenses, alcohol or drug abuse, or violations of her employment 
rules.    
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her December 6, 2013 SF 
86, December 28, 2013 credit report, SOR response, and hearing transcript. (GE 1, 2, 
                                            
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

HE 2, 3) Her SOR alleges 16 delinquent, charged-off, or collection debts for $18,887 as 
follows: (1)-(3) ¶ 1.a ($4,785), ¶ 1.b ($3,588), and ¶ 1.c ($3,517) are for student loan 
debts; (4) ¶ 1.d ($1,820) is a collection debt; (5)-(13), (15)-(16) ¶¶ 1.e to 1.m, 1.o, and 
1.p ($5,076) are medical collection debts; and (14) ¶ 1.n ($101) is a utilities debt.    
 
 Applicant is current on her income taxes. (Tr. 35) Her three student loans in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a to 1.c now total $10,335. Her federal income tax refunds of $2,400 were 
intercepted to pay her student loan debts. (Tr. 35-38) In 2014, her refund of $1,200 was 
applied to her student loans. (Tr. 36) She paid a total of about $3,500 to address her 
student loans. (Tr. 38) Her student loans were placed into a rehabilitation program; she 
made her payments; she completed the rehabilitation period; the amount of the required 
payments were increased to an unaffordable level; and the student loans went back into 
default status. (Tr. 45) 
 
 Applicant paid off three credit card debts over the last four years, including the 
credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.d (1,820), which was paid using allotments from her pay. 
(Tr. 23-25, 46; AE F) She also paid three medical debts. (Tr. 39) Applicant and her 
fiancé are able to pay all of their current debts and expenses. (Tr. 40) Applicant does 
not own a vehicle, and she obtains rides to work from friends, her mother, or her fiancé. 
(Tr. 40) Her mother cares for her son when she is at work. (Tr. 40-41)  
 
Applicant’s medical bills were generated when she was unemployed and did not 
have health insurance. (Tr. 31) She had gall bladder surgery in 2009, and most of the 
bills were not pursued; however, a few of them were placed on her credit report. (Tr. 32-
33) When she was pregnant with her son, she qualified for subsidized medical benefits. 
(Tr. 35) Applicant was able to receive health insurance on January 1, 2014. (Tr. 35) One 
collection company is seeking payment of eight of the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.h 
and 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p; however, the collection company has not communicated with 
Applicant recently, and most of her medical debts are related to the treatment she 
received in 2009. (Tr. 42-44) The two debts for $870 in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g may be the 
same medical debt. (Tr. 43) 
 
Applicant planned to pay the utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.n for $101. (Tr. 42) She did 
not pay it earlier because she lost the bill and forgot that she owed it. (Tr. 42) 
 
 Applicant was unemployed for three years after leaving college because she was 
caring for a sick relative and then she became sick herself. (Tr. 30) She obtained part-
time employment from October 2012 to February 2013. (Tr. 29) Applicant committed 
herself to paying her debts. 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Two of Applicant supervisors and a coworker lauded Applicant’s work 
performance. (AE B-D) They described her as reliable, trustworthy, conscientious, 
professional, and positive.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance [or 
trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 
484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” 
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit report, SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges 16 delinquent 
collection debts for $18,887. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.

  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
  AG ¶¶ 20(a) to 20(c) are applicable. Applicant’s debts resulted from 
unemployment, underemployment, and medical problems. She paid one SOR debt for 
$1,800. She paid $3,500 to address her student loans. She paid some non-SOR debts. 
Applicant provided evidence that she established and maintained contact with some of 
her creditors.4   
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence5 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
  Applicant paid about $5,000 to address her SOR debts over the last three years. 
She has made steady progress reducing her delinquent debt. There is no evidence of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Her 
illness, loss of employment, and underemployment are circumstances largely beyond 
her control. She understands what she must do to establish and maintain her financial 
responsibility.6 The Appeal Board explained that circumstances beyond one’s control 
                                            
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
5 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
6The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
can cause unresolved debt, and are not necessarily a bar to having access to sensitive 
and classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions 
to resolve as much of her SOR debts as was possible based on her circumstances. 
There are clear indications the problem is being resolved and is under control. Her 
efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old customer service representative employed by a 
defense contractor who works with medical records. In 2003, she graduated from high 
school. She attended college full time for three years, majored in psychology, but did

not receive a degree. She has a 17-month-old son. Her fiancé, her son, and Applicant 
live together. Two of her supervisors and a coworker described her as reliable, 
trustworthy, conscientious, professional, and positive. There is no evidence of 
reportable criminal offenses, alcohol or drug abuse, or violations of her employment 
rules. She is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her public trust 
responsibilities. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States, the DOD, 
and her employer.   
 
Applicant is credited with admitting responsibility for her delinquent debts on her 
SF 86. Her illness, loss of employment, and underemployment caused her to have 
financial problems. These are all circumstances largely beyond her control. The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She paid about $5,000 over the last three years to address 
about $18,000 in delinquent SOR debts. She took reasonable actions under her 
particular financial circumstances to address her delinquent debts. Her overall history 
shows a “meaningful track record” of debt repayment. I am confident she will continue 
her establishment and maintenance of her financial responsibility.7   
                                            
7Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of access to sensitive information now does 
not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to 
reconsider [trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct 
having negative [trustworthiness] significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). 
Violation of a promise made in a [trustworthiness] context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.p:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
