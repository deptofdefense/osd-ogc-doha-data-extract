GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 26, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (E-QIP).1  On June 
13, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – 
Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective 
within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness 
concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct), and 
detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative

 Government Exhibit 1 ((e-QIP), dated December 26, 2012). 
 
2 
                                      
 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to 
support a contract with the Department of Defense, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2014. In a written 
statement, notarized on July 18, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on September 29, 2014, and the case was 
assigned to me on October 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 27, 
2014, scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2014. I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled. 
 
 At the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the 
SOR by withdrawing the allegation under Guideline E. There being no objection by 
Applicant, the motion was granted, and SOR ¶ 2 and its subparagraph (2.a.) were 
withdrawn.2 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and 
one Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 26, 2014. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it, but he did not take advantage of that 
opportunity. The record closed on November 21, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f., and 1.h. through 1.j.) of the 
SOR. He denied the one remaining allegation as well as the one factual allegation 
related to personal conduct. 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain his eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the 
Department of Defense. He served on active duty with the U.S. Army from July 1992 
until July 1997, and received an honorable discharge.3 He is a June 1992 high school 
graduate.4 He was unemployed from May 2011 until August 2011.5 Applicant joined his 
current employer in February 2013.6 He was married in May 1993, divorced in June 
1999, married again in June 2006, and divorced in August 2008.7 He has three sons, 
aged 19, 16, and 8.8

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant initially started experiencing financial difficulties when he was going 
through his first divorce in 1999. He was in the process of recovering from those 
difficulties when a series of events occurred, resulting in the exacerbation of his 
financial problems.9  In early 2007, he accompanied his second wife (who was in the 
U.S. Army) to a new duty station in an area where the living expenses were higher. As a 
result of the move, he also relinquished a job that paid him roughly $20,000 more each 
year than the one he was able to obtain following the move.10 He had greater expenses 
and less money to pay them, and things “kind of snowballed from there.”11 As he 
subsequently noted: “I wasn’t in a good place, and I let things fall behind, and rather 
than being responsible and addressing these problems head on, I shamefully closed my 
eyes to them, and let it - - I couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t deal with it, I should say.”12 He 
added: “I decided that making her happy was more important than doing the things that 
I felt probably would have been right, and so that’s when things really started to pile 
up.”13  
 
Applicant has child support agreements with both ex-wives. He is supposed to 
pay his ex-wives approximately $400 per month for his two oldest sons and $670 a 
month for his youngest son.14 While he contends he is making the payments for his 
youngest son,15 the same is not true regarding his two older children. Because of his 
decreased salary, the amount he pays for his youngest son “is almost equal to the 
amount that [he brings] home.”16 Accordingly, he is not making the support payments for 
the two older children, and claims he has an unspecified arrangement with their 
mother.17 Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant is apparently delinquent in paying 
his child support for his two older children in the amount of $4,330.18 He stated: “I’m not 
making enough money to make ends meet. I’m eating Ramen noodles, and still I’m 
falling further and further behind.”19

The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies as generally 
reflected by credit reports from January 201320 and March 2014,21 totaling 
approximately $14,643. Three of those accounts, while not listed in the credit reports, 
total $7,400, and are for unpaid income taxes for the years 2004, 2007, and 2008. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): While Applicant was out of town, someone broke into his 
apartment. The landlord never contacted him and simply repaired the door. Although he 
was in the middle of his lease, Applicant broke his lease and, as he characterized it, 
“unwisely” moved out.22 The account, with a remaining balance of $3,301, was placed 
for collection in 2011.23 Applicant explained that he no longer had a job and was unable 
to afford the rent.24 He also claimed he would dispute the amount,25 but offered no 
evidence of a dispute or any documentation to support any such action. He 
acknowledged he never contacted the creditor in an attempt to resolve the matter 
because he was not in a financial position to do so.26 The account has not been 
resolved. 
 
There are two telephone accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. for $370, and 1.f. for $148) that 
were placed for collection;27 one credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.c. for $450) that was 
charged off and sold or transferred;28 two credit card accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d. for $2,346, 
and 1.e. for $532) that were placed for collection;29 and one utility account (SOR ¶ 1.g. 
for $96) that was placed for collection.30 Applicant contended he paid the utility 
account,31 but offered no documentation to support his contention. As for the other 
accounts identified above, Applicant made no efforts to contact the various creditors to 
set up repayment arrangements, and has made no payments on any of those 
accounts.32 None of the accounts have been resolved.

(SOR ¶¶ 1.h. through 1.j.): Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2004 
on time, may have received a refund, but subsequently was notified that he owed 
additional money.33 He currently owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
approximately $1,887 in unpaid taxes.34 He filed his federal income tax return for 2007 
in 2010, and owes the IRS approximately $2,351.35 He filed his federal income tax 
return for 2008 in 2010, and owes the IRS approximately $3,161.36 At one point, 
Applicant and the IRS agreed to a repayment arrangement under which $25 would be 
garnished from his wages each week, but when he left his employer in mid-2011, he 
failed to notify the IRS of his relocation or to reestablish the automatic debit from his 
salary.37 Applicant has still not contacted the IRS.38 Although he currently has money 
withheld from his salary for current salary, he has insufficient funds available to pay his 
old income tax delinquencies.39 None of the accounts have been resolved. 
 
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his state or federal 
income tax returns for 2012 or 2013.40 He has no excuse for not timely filing his income 
tax returns.41 He is currently a month and a half behind in his rent payments.42 Applicant 
has never received financial counseling.43

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”45 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”46 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”47 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.48  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”49 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.50  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.51 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise concerns. As noted above, Applicant has been experiencing financial 
problems since 1999, and while he may have recovered from some of those difficulties, 
he was beset by new and continuing financial issues in early 2007. With insufficient 
funds to make his monthly payments, accounts were placed for collection, one account 
was charged off, and some federal income taxes remain unpaid. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply.

The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial concerns may be mitigated where “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”52  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies, but ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. The 
conditions that may have contributed to Applicant’s initial financial problems were his 
first divorce in 1999, but he failed to specify how that divorce negatively impacted his 
finances. His relocation in 2007, reduced salary, unemployment in 2011, and second 
divorce also caused some financial strain, but aside from some generalities regarding 
his second wife, and his child support payment obligations, he has offered very little 
specificity as to the negative impact those matters had upon his finances. Over the 
years, Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts.  As to his non-tax accounts, he never contacted any of his creditors and failed to 
initiate any effort, much less a “good-faith effort,” to start repaying any of them before 
the hearing. As to his IRS delinquencies, while he contends he made payments in early 
2011, he offered no documentary evidence to support his contentions, and he failed to 
reinstitute any such payments once he relocated to a new job. Instead, Applicant 
ignored his debts and continues to do so. He never received any financial counseling. 
Applicant failed to act responsibly under the circumstances.53  
                                                          
52
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

53
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He served 
honorably with the U.S. Army, and has been supporting his youngest son. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant generally ignored his creditors and did not make any efforts to pay them. His 
long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange 
payment plans, as well as his apparent failure to support his older children or file his 
federal income tax returns on time, while not alleged in the SOR, reflect traits which 
raise concerns about his fitness to hold a public trust position. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a Public Trust Position to support a contract with the Department of Defense.  
Eligibility is denied.
