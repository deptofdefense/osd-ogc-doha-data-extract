Decision 
______________ 
 
 
TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Clearance 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 14, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 31, 2014, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). The action was 
taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 On August 25, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR. On September 23, 2014, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On September 29, 2014, DOHA 
assigned the case to me. On October 16, 2014, DOHA issued a notice of hearing 
scheduling the hearing for November 4, 2014. The hearing was held as scheduled. 
2 
 
At the hearing, the Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, 
which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered 
Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received into evidence without 
objection. 
 
I held the record open until November 14, 2014, to afford the Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE D through K, 
which were received into evidence without objection. On November 14, 2014, DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all of the SOR debts with explanations. After a thorough 
review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Background Information 
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old senior engineer, who has been working for a defense 
contractor since March 2014. He seeks a security clearance, which is a condition of his 
continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24, 79.) 
 
 Applicant graduated from high school in June 1974. He was awarded a bachelor 
of science degree in civil engineering in May 1983. Applicant also attended several 
classes in management and finance at a community college. (GE 1; Tr. 24-26.) 
 
 Applicant married in May 1981, and has four adult children – a 27-year-old 
daughter, a 25-year-old son, and two 21-year-old twin sons. Applicant maintains two 
residences in two different states, one located near his place of employment and the 
other in an adjacent state where his wife and three adult sons live and are dependent 
on him for support. Applicant’s wife and three sons suffer from severe depression. His 
wife was employed as a nurse until 2010 and has been unable to work since then 
because of her medical condition.  (GE 1; Tr. 26-29, 35, 81-82.) Applicant did not serve 
in the armed forces. (GE 1; Tr. 15.) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR contains ten separate allegations – a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in 
July 2010 that was dismissed in October 2013 for failure to comply; five state tax liens 
filed in May 2004 for $4,008, in August 2007 for $8,227, in November 2007 for $5,287, 
in February 2009 for $8,785, and in August 2013 for $2,610; a charged-off student loan 
for $47,932; a utility collection account for $146; and two charged-off student loan 
accounts with the same lender for $13,488 and $30,240.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.j; GE 4; Tr. 
76-77.) 
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his wife’s “on and off employment 
because of her mental condition” that began in “about 2003” which interrupted their 
income stream. Applicant took on additional contract work to make up the income 
3 
 
shortfall following his wife’s inability to work. In 2010, Applicant’s wife stopped working 
completely after suffering a nervous breakdown. Applicant estimated from 2003 to 2010, 
his wife was unable to work 70% of the time. Additionally, Applicant was unemployed 
from December 2009 to April 2010. (SOR answer; GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 29-33, 35.) His wife’s 
family has a history of mental illness that has adversely affected his wife and three 
sons, as well as his wife’s brother, who is institutionalized. (Tr. 41-47.) Applicant stated 
that the majority of his financial problems stem from his family’s mental health problems. 
However, he was unable or unwilling to produce any documentation of same. (SOR 
answer; GE 2; AE D; Tr. 72, 75.) 
 
Following this difficult economic time, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 
July 2010 with aggressive monthly payments of $3,200 in addition to making student 
loan payments he had co-signed for three of his children. He continued to pay into his 
wage earner plan until approximately October 2013 and was able to significantly reduce 
his overall debt. (SOR ¶ 1.a; SOR answer; GE 2; Tr. 33-34, 35-41, 47-51, 74-75.)  
 
Applicant submitted documentation post-hearing that the five state tax liens 
totalling $28,917 alleged in his SOR have been paid down to $7,563 as of October 16, 
2014. The same documentation; however, reflected that his state taxing authority was 
unable to enter into an installment payment plan with Applicant because his tax returns 
were missing for tax years 2011 and 2012. (AE I.) Applicant’s state tax problems stem 
from his failure to file tax returns for supplemental contract work and did not have tax 
withheld, discussed supra. Applicant attributed this shortcoming to “some extenuating 
circumstances that came into play . . . we had some emergencies that popped up.” 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.f; SOR answer; GE 2, AE A; Tr. 51-58, 64, 72-74.) He has made 
progress with his tax problems, but his failure to file tax returns for 2011 and 2012 
makes resolution uncertain.  
 
The utility collection account for $146 was paid as of October 16, 2014. (SOR ¶ 
1.h; AE B.) Debt resolved.  
 
Applicant’s post-hearing documents indicate that he entered into a payment plan 
with the lender for his charged-off $47,932 loan effective November 21, 2014 for $300 
per month. With regard to his remaining charged-off student loan accounts for $13,488 
and $30,240, the lender advised Applicant that full payment is required for both 
accounts, due to the length of account inactivity and that a “deferment option is off the 
table.” (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, 1j; SOR answer; Tr. 58-62, 74; AE J.)  One student loan being 
resolved and two student loans remain unresolved. 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $126,000. Factoring in the costs of maintaining two 
residences, and supporting himself, his wife and three adult sons, Applicant has a net 
monthly remainder of $535. It is clear from his budget that Applicant maintains a modest 
lifestyle and lives within his means. (Tr. 64-69, 74; AE H.) Applicant participated in the 
mandatory financial counseling when he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2010 and 
found it to be “very helpful.” (Tr. 75-76.)

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant submitted two favorable reference letters. The first letter was from his 
current manager and the second letter was from a co-worker and senior engineering 
specialist. Both individuals were supportive of Applicant and recommend him for a 
security clearance. (AE F, AE G.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
5 
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is established by the evidence presented. The 
Government established disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because there 
is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt is 
a “continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 
(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Nevertheless, he receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(a) 
because the debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. 
Nevertheless, his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. 
 
Partial application of AG ¶ 20(b) is warranted. Applicant’s brief period of 
unemployment in 2009 and 2010 and his family’s history of mental illness could not 
have been anticipated. However, I would have been inclined to give greater weight to 
Applicant’s emphasis on his family’s history of mental illness as mitigation had he 
provided documentation of same which would have included dates, levels of debilitation, 
and to what extent the levels of debilitation contributed to Applicant’s financial situation.1  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially is applicable. Applicant benefited from the financial 
counseling he receiving during the 2010 bankruptcy process. However, that process 
has not netted him the status of regaining full financial responsibility. When his Chapter 
13 was dismissed without discharging his debts, the value of counseling was shown to 
be somewhat less than optimal. 
 
Applicant produced sufficient documentation to warrant partial mitigation under 
AG ¶ 20(d).2 Applicant paid down a significant amount of debt during the Chapter 13 
                                                          
1
“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his 
debts current. 
 
2
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
7 
 
bankruptcy process, paid off the majority of his back state taxes, began making 
payments on one student loan, and paid off a modest utility bill. Unfortunately, his 
remaining state tax liability of $7,563 is unresolved and two of his three student loans 
remain unresolved with large balances. Applicant did not set up a payment plan for the 
remaining two student loans until after the hearing.  AG ¶ 20(e) is not relevant. 
   
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under 
Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are 
warranted. 
Applicant’s employment as a Government contractor weighs in his favor. He is a 
law-abiding citizen and contributes to the national defense. Apart from his SOR debts, 
there is no evidence to suggest that he is not current on his day-to-day expenses. 
 
A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010.) An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish 
a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
8 
 
simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid 
first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).   
 
However, Applicant’s inability to address a significant amount of debt precludes a 
favorable decision. I am not unmindful of the circumstances that led to his financial 
difficulties or his past efforts to regain financial responsibility. It would have been helpful 
for him to have documented and developed his family’s history of mental illness, but 
having done so does not suggest that he would have for certain been able to mitigate 
security concerns raised. He did not sufficiently address a significant amount of student 
loans and unpaid delinquent state taxes and the substantial priority debts cannot be 
ignored. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole-person, I conclude he has not mitigated 
financial considerations security concerns. 
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative 
process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. 
For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.f: Against Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.h: For Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.i to 1.j:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
