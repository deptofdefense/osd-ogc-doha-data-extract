DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 24 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s security clearance. On June 29, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. This case was assigned to me on August 18, 2014. On September 
 
2 
 
 
11, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of 
Hearing scheduling the hearing for September 25, 2014.1 The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
6. GE 1 and 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant’s objections to 
GE 4 (records of judgments), 5 (credit report), and 6 (credit report) were overruled. After 
questioning Applicant about GE 2, Department Counsel withdrew GE 2 (summary of an 
Office of Personnel Management interview). Applicant testified and offered Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted into evidence without objection. After 
the hearing, Applicant submitted documents that were marked as AE F through J and 
admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was 
received on October 3, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old software engineer. He graduated from high school in 
1976, earned three bachelor’s degrees in 1984 and 1985, and has completed all of the 
classes for a master’s degree but has not yet been awarded that degree. He has not 
served in the military. He has been married and divorced four times. His latest marriage 
ended in 2008. He has five children, ages 12, 13, 19, 31, and 33. He has held a security 
clearance for a number of years without incident.2 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling $24,358 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one allegation (SOR ¶ 
1.d) and denied the others. His admission is incorporated as a finding of fact.3  
 
This is a reapplication for a security clearance. Applicant was previously denied a 
security clearance following a hearing (ISCR Case No. 09-01321, dated November 23, 
2009). The previous SOR alleged 26 delinquent debts under Guideline F, totaling about 
$79,000. The majority of those debts became delinquent between 2002 and 2004. The 
Administrative Judge traced Applicant’s financial problems to him being “forced to quit” 
a good-paying job in 2002 after his manager found out that he was doing contract work 
for a competitor company, creating a conflict of interest. Although not alleged in the 
SOR, the Administrative Judge noted Applicant had been $38,140 in arrears in child 
support payments in January 2007 for which his wages were garnished and, by August 
2009, had reduced the arrearages to $11,196. In that case, Applicant entered into a 
debt management agreement with a credit counseling service following receipt of 
financial interrogatories. He provided no proof of payments under that agreement. The 
Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant partially resolved two of the delinquent 
                                                          
1 At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. See Tr. 12-13.

debts, but failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility and made no 
effective progress in resolving his debts.4  
 
Applicant stated that, after the denial of his security clearance request in 2009, 
he has not had stable employment. He testified that he was unemployed four times 
since 2009 and applied for unemployment compensation for each of those periods. His 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) reflected that he was 
unemployed from May 2012 to July 2012 and from August 2013 to November 2013, but 
otherwise indicated continuous employment since 2009 with a number of employers. He 
indicated that he had difficulty finding a permanent job without a security clearance. He 
noted that he worked temporary jobs, including six-month contracts. At the hearing, he 
indicated that he was unemployed and had stopped working about two weeks earlier.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – judgment for $2,826. This was an apartment lease that Applicant 
signed when he was living with his ex-wife and their children. During the lease, 
Applicant moved out of the apartment, while his then-wife and children continued to live 
there. He believed the judgment may have been for cleaning service expenses or 
damage to the apartment and considered those charges his ex-wife’s responsibility. The 
judgment was filed against him in February 2008. He provided no proof of payments 
toward this debt, but indicated that he would pay it. He also stated that he disputed the 
debt before the judgment; however, he presented no documentation of the dispute.6  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – collection account for $16,570. This was a child support arrearage 
for Applicant’s two youngest children. His child support payments for those children are 
about $1,259 per month. He presented a payment record that showed he was making 
inconsistent child support payments in 2013. Starting in December 2013, his wages 
were garnished for those payments. Additionally, his income tax refunds for tax years 
2012 ($1,885) and 2013 ($4,192) were withheld for this debt. He testified that he has 
not received an income tax refund “for a while.” He reunited with his ex-wife and two 
children for a year and a half in 2011 and 2012. He continued to make child support 
payments while they were together and later petitioned the court to credit him for those 
payments. He testified that a judge reduced his monthly child support payments, but 
also extended those payments until his two children reached the age of 19. He did not 
provide any documentation supporting the claimed modification, but did submit a credit 
report dated September 23, 2014, reflecting this child support arrearage was $9,217.7

reflected in his e-QIP. See Tr. 45-46, 65; GE 1.

SOR ¶ 1.c – collection account for $4,076. This was a child support arrearage for 
Applicant’s third youngest child. This account was from a different state than the 
account listed in SOR ¶ 1.b, above. He indicated that he got behind on these child 
support payments when he was laid off from a job in 1996. In his Answer to the SOR, 
he provided a court record dated April 11, 2014, reflecting the termination of the 
garnishment order for this debt. His credit report dated September 23, 2014, reflected 
this debt was paid and closed.8  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – charged-off account for $423. This was a credit card account that 
had a date of first delinquency/date of last activity of December 2007. Applicant stated 
that he tried to contact the creditor, but could not reach anyone to pay. He also 
indicated that he received a letter from the creditor about three weeks before the 
hearing that offered a settlement, but he had not yet responded to the letter at the time 
of the hearing.9  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – collection account for $155. This was a cable television account that 
was placed for collection in July 2008. In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he stated that 
he paid this debt. No documentation was presented to show this debt was paid or 
otherwise resolved. It did not appear on credit reports that Applicant presented, but 
appeared on credit reports from a different credit reporting bureau that Department 
Counsel presented. Insufficient evidence was presented to conclude this debt was 
resolved.10  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g – collection accounts for $123 and $100, respectively. These 
were medical debts that were placed for collection in June 2009 and June 2012. 
Applicant testified that he paid these debts. He provided no documentation showing the 
payments. These debts did not appear on credit reports that Applicant presented, but 
appeared on credit reports from a different credit reporting bureau that Department 
Counsel presented. Insufficient evidence was presented to conclude these debts were 
resolved.11  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – collection account for $85. This was for an unpaid parking ticket. It is 
unknown when this account became delinquent, but it was opened as a collection 
account in December 2009. In Applicant’s reapplication request, he provided a money 
order showing this debt was paid in July 2012.12

Applicant established an account with a credit repair company in July 2014. 
However, no documents were presented to show the efforts, if any, that company has 
taken to help resolve his financial problems. His credit reports reflect that he resolved 
six past-due debts that were not alleged in the SOR. The amounts of those 
delinquencies are unknown. His most recent credit report also reflected that he had nine 
current accounts.13 
 
Applicant had a judgment entered against him for $1,294 in October 2007 that 
was not alleged in the SOR. No evidence was presented to show this judgment was 
resolved. He stated that the judgment was his ex-wife’s responsibility, but indicated that 
he would address it. His pay stub reflected two garnishments – one for child support in 
the amount of $375 per week and another for $200 per week. He initially indicated that 
the garnishment for $200 was for repayment of unemployment compensation. This 
overpayment apparently occurred because he was receiving unemployment 
compensation in one state, obtained employment in another state, and did not 
immediately notify the former state of his re-employment. He did not know how much 
unemployment compensation he was required to pay back. He indicated that the 
garnishment was still in effect when he stopped working about two weeks before the 
hearing, but also stated the amount owed had been repaid. He further contradicted 
himself by stating that the $200 garnishment was for child support payments and that he 
was still paying a little over $100 per week for the overpayment of unemployment 
compensation. Based on his testimony, the basis for the $200 garnishment was 
unclear.14 
 
Applicant testified that he had about $2,000 in bank accounts at the time of the 
hearing. He also said that 2014 was a tough year financially because of the added 
expenses of having his two youngest children with him over the summer.15 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v.

considered (a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful 
rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; or (e) to provide 
evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive Section 6.3 . . . ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct 24, 2003).” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006). Non-alleged conduct will only 
be considered for these limited purposes.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
 
7 
 
 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to satisfy 
over an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;   
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
8 
 
 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant was divorced in 2008. He also indicated that he had difficulty obtaining 
stable employment since 2009 because he did not have a security clearance. His 
divorce, unlike the prior denial of his security clearance, was a condition beyond his 
control. Under AG ¶ 20(b), an applicant must show not only that his financial problems 
were the result of a condition largely beyond his or her control, but also that he or she 
acted responsibly under the circumstances. Here, Applicant failed to show that he acted 
responsibly in addressing his delinquent debts in the intervening six years since his 
latest divorce. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies.  
  
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. In his prior security clearance 
proceeding, the SOR alleged 26 delinquent debts totaling about $79,000. In the present 
proceeding, the SOR alleged only eight delinquent debts totaling about $24,000. His 
credit reports reflected that six non-alleged, past-due debts were paid. What action 
Applicant took to resolve the delinquent debts alleged in the first SOR is unknown. 
While Applicant is making progress in reducing his financial problems, those problems 
are ongoing, significant, and continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. He provided proof that he voluntarily resolved one 
of the alleged debts (SOR ¶ 1.h), which was approximately $100. One child support 
arrearage was resolved through garnishment. He was making inconsistent payments on 
the other child support arrearage in 2013 before his pay was again garnished. The 
biggest reduction in that remaining child support arrearage occurred when his 2013 
income tax refund was withheld. No track record of payments was presented for the 
other debts. Based on the evidence, I cannot find that his financial problems are under 
control, are being resolved, and are unlikely to recur. AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies. AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. He presented no documentation to show he has a 
legitimate basis for disputing any of the debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
9 
 
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the whole-person factors as well as the potentially disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this 
case. Despite the presence of some mitigation, the security concerns under Guideline F 
remain. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
       
   Subparagraphs 1.a -1.b:  Against Applicant   
   Subparagraph 1.c:  For Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.d -1.g: Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.h:  For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
