LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 22, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 24, 2014. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
November 10, 2014, scheduling the hearing for December 2, 2014. The hearing was 
convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in 
 
2 
 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through M, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until 
December 15, 2014, for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted 
documents that were marked AE N through P and admitted without objection. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 10, 2014.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has an 
associate’s degree with additional college credits. He is married with a stepchild and an 
adult child from a previous relationship.1 
 
 Applicant worked overseas for a defense contractor from 2007 to November 
2011. He was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer in October 2012. 
He was unable to pay all his bills while he was unemployed, and a number of debts 
became delinquent. He could not pass a physical for his overseas assignment, and he 
was on medical leave from December 2013 through March 2014.2 
 
 The SOR alleges six delinquent medical debts with balances totaling about 
$17,000 and seven miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $13,285. Applicant 
admitted owing the $4,897 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He denied owing the remaining 
debts, either because he paid the debts or because they were not his debts. 
 
 Applicant had a delinquent loan and a delinquent credit card account with the 
credit union identified in SOR ¶ 1.a. The unpaid $4,897 loan was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
The delinquent credit card debt of $4,548 was not alleged in the SOR. The first seven 
numbers of the accounts are identical, so it is difficult to differentiate the two accounts. 
Applicant paid the credit union $2,338 in December 2013, $1,556 in May 2014, and 
$2,048 on December 1, 2014. The $2,048 payment was in settlement of the $4,897 loan 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The $1,556 payment went toward the credit card. It is unclear 
what account was credited with the $2,338 payment.3 
 
 Applicant settled the $719 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b in December 2014. He 
settled the $540 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d for $243 in May 2014. He settled 
the $2,475 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f for $991 in May 2014.4   
 
 In May and June 2014, Applicant paid or settled the medical debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($820), 1.k ($469), 1.l ($260), and 1.m ($217).5

 Applicant denied owing the remaining debts. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an $808 debt to 
a credit card company. SOR ¶ 1.h alleges an $833 debt to a collection company on 
behalf of a bank. These are the same debts because the credit card company acquired 
the credit card holdings of the bank in 2012.6 The debt to the credit card company is 
listed on the June 2013 credit report. It is listed on the December 2013 and November 
2014 credit reports, but the reports list the debt as being in dispute with a zero balance. 
The debt to the collection company on behalf of the bank is listed on the December 
2013 credit report as in dispute with an investigation in process. It is not listed on the 
November 2014 credit report.7 
 
 Applicant denied owing the $3,013 department store credit card account alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.e. The debt is listed on the December 2013 credit report as in dispute with 
an investigation in process. It also reported that the account was transferred, and it had 
a zero balance. The debt does not appear on the November 2014 credit report.8 
 
 Applicant stated that he paid the $581 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j. He 
denied responsibility for the $14,656 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. The debts are 
listed on the 2013 credit reports. The $14,656 debt is listed as in dispute with an 
investigation in process. Neither debt appears on the November 2014 credit report.9 
 
 Applicant testified that his finances have greatly improved. He owes the IRS 
about $2,500 for tax tear 2012. He credibly testified that he will pay his taxes. He is 
working overseas again making enough money to pay all his bills, including his taxes. 
He has not received formal financial counseling.10 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables

known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable:   
 
 
 
5 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts and was unable to pay his financial 
obligations. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable.  
 
 The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. 
When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of 
the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 
03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). SOR ¶ 1.h is 
concluded for Applicant. 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
  Applicant worked overseas for a defense contractor from 2007 to November 
2011. He was unemployed for almost a year until he was hired by his current employer 
in October 2012. He could not pass a physical for his overseas assignment, and he was 
on medical leave from December 2013 through March 2014. These events were beyond 
his control. To be fully applicable, AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that the individual act 
responsibly under the circumstances.  
   
 
6 
 
  Applicant has resolved all the debts alleged in the SOR. He paid or settled eight 
debts, and he successfully disputed the remaining debts. His finances are not perfect 
because he still owes the IRS. He credibly testified that he will pay his taxes. 
 
  I find that Applicant made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial 
problems occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 
20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(a) is not completely applicable because Applicant still has 
his tax debt to be resolved. AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the successfully-disputed debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 I considered the events that contributed to Applicant’s financial problems, and the 
steps he has taken to resolve those problems. I am convinced his finances are 
sufficiently stable to warrant a security clearance.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.m:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
