O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for 
financial considerations. His request for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 3, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) that detailed security concerns under Guideline F 
(financial considerations). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992) as amended; and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the four allegations under 
Guideline F. 
 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of 
Hearing on September 5, 2014, setting the hearing date for September 24, 2014. 
Before the hearing, Department Counsel provided Applicant with a copy of the 
Government exhibits to be offered. I marked Department Counsel’s cover letter 
accompanying the documents as Hearing Exhibit I. At the hearing, I admitted into 
 
 
 
2 
evidence four Government exhibits (GE 1-4).1 The Government’s exhibit list is 
marked HE II-a.2 Applicant testified and presented seven exhibits, admitted into 
evidence as Applicant exhibits (AE) A-G. I granted Applicant's request to hold the 
record open for additional documentation. He timely submitted seven exhibits, 
which I admitted as AE H-N. I marked Department Counsel’s memorandum in 
response to Applicant’s post-hearing submission as HE III. DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 2, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a 
thorough review of the pleadings and the evidence, I make the following 
additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 36 years old. He married in December 2005, and has 4 
children 8 to 14 years of age. Three of the children do not live with him, and he 
provides child support. He is attending college and expects to complete a 
bachelor’s degree in information technology in 2017. He has worked for the past 
two years as a satellite communications engineer and project coordinator for a 
defense contractor. Applicant has held a security clearance for approximately 12 
years. (GE 1; Tr. 32-42, 47) 
 
From 1999 to 2002, when he was 21 to 24 years old, Applicant worked in 
the United States and lived with his parents. His mother completed his income tax 
returns, and he signed them. He believes he received refunds. Starting in 2002, 
he served in the Army National Guard for several years. He then began working 
for defense contractors, and was employed overseas in countries A (May 2004 – 
February 2007) and B (June 2007 – January 2009).3 (GE 1; Tr. 29-32, 43-53) 
 
Applicant did not timely file federal income tax returns for 2004 through 
2012, or state tax returns for 2005 through 2010.  While living overseas between 
2004 and 2009, coworkers told him that his income was not taxable because he 
was working outside the United States, and that after he returned home, he had 
three years to file the returns. (Tr. 60) When asked to clarify, he testified,  
 
                                                 
1 At the hearing, Applicant noted that his 2002 credit report, GE 4, lists an incorrect address. He 
also noted that an address he provided during his security interview (at page 11 of his DOHA 
interrogatory response), is incorrect. With these corrections, Applicant did not object to the 
exhibit. (GE 2, 4; Tr. 14-18) 
 
2 Department Counsel inadvertently offered an inaccurate exhibit list, included in the record as 
HE II-b. She replaced it with a corrected version, marked as HE II-a. (Tr. 12) 
 
3 Applicant’s security clearance application indicates he left country B in November 2009, but he 
testified he left in January 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 49) 
 
 
3 
APPLICANT: From when you came back stateside, you had at 
least three years for each tax year.  
 
ADMIN. JUDGE O'BRIEN: So, if you came back in 2010, you thought 
you would have three years from 2010 to 2013, to file your 2004 tax 
return? 
 
APPLICANT: Yes, yes, Ma'am. 
 
He also believed that because he was owed refunds, he did not have to file 
returns. He planned to recover the refunds by filing when he returned to the 
United States. However, he did not recoup refunds, because he did not file returns 
within the required time frame. Applicant also testified he did not claim the 
appropriate filing status for his income level, which resulted in his owing taxes to 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to his state of residence. He has now 
adjusted his filing status to single with no exemptions in order to avoid such 
problems in the future. (GE 1; Tr. 29-32, 43-53, 59-61, 74, 82) 
 
On July 21, 2011, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for tax years 
2004 through 2007. It was based on returns the IRS had filed for Applicant, and 
showed delinquent income taxes totaling $42,248. Applicant stated in his June 
2013 response to DOHA interrogatories that the $42,248 balance was inaccurate 
because he was due refunds for 2004 through 2008. However, the IRS tax lien 
document shows he owed balances for 2004 through 2007. On September 26, 
2011, he filed his first delinquent tax return, for tax year 2008.4 The lien was 
released on May 29, 2013. (GE 2; AE K, L, N) 
 
 At his security interview in May 2012,5 Applicant stated he was aware that 
the federal government might have filed a tax lien against him because he had not 
filed timely returns between 2004 and 2011. He also stated he filed his 2004 and 
2008 federal returns before completing his security clearance application in April 
2012. As of the date of his security interview, he planned to file his returns one at 
a time, every other week. He believed a refund was due to him for each unfiled 
tax year. He planned to pay any penalties he owed, and have all his back taxes 
resolved by August 2012. (GE 2) 
                                                 
4 Applicant's interrogatory response shows his 2005 tax return was filed in January 2006. (GE 2 
at 54) However, Applicant denied that it was filed then because he was in country B at the time. 
The 2005 return does not show Applicant's signature or indicate when it was filed. Applicant's AE 
K shows the 2005 return was filed in 2012. (GE 2; AE L; Tr. 65) 
 
5 DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the written report of his security interview to review. He 
made one comment concerning a disputed insurance debt, which is not alleged in the SOR. He 
signed a notarized statement on June 11, 2013 indicating that, other than the disputed insurance 
debt, the report accurately reflected the information he provided during the interview. (GE 2)

  Applicant submitted a chart (AE K) stating that he filed his federal returns 
between 2011 and 2014, as follows:  
 
• 2004, 2005, 2006  April 26 through May 21, 2012 
• 2007    April 17, 2013 
• 2008    September 26, 20116  
• 2009 through 2013  February 11 through April 7, 20147 
 
Applicant’s income tax delinquencies appear in his credit report of April 
2012. He testified that he currently owes the IRS $30,500. He stated the IRS 
would not allow him to begin a payment plan until it had finished processing all his 
returns. He stayed in touch with the agency regarding processing. On May 5, 
2014, he requested the IRS accept a payment plan of $200 per month toward his 
delinquencies, and he paid $200 in June, July, and August 2014. Subsequently, 
he was able to increase the payment. On August 20, 2014, the IRS agreed to a 
payment plan of $450 per month. In September 2014, he paid $450. The four 
payments he made in 2014 were applied to his 2009 tax liability. If Applicant fails 
to meet the plan conditions, the IRS can take enforcement action including a tax 
lien or a levy on his wages or bank accounts. Interest and penalties will continue 
to accrue until his taxes are paid. (GE 3; AE C, E, G; Tr. 74-82) 
 
As to his delinquent state income taxes, Applicant provided evidence of a 
May 2014 agreement with his state taxing authority to pay a balance of $670 in 14 
monthly payments. (Answer at 4) In May and June 2014, he made payments of 
$50 and $65 toward his 2010 state income tax. A September 23, 2014 printout 
from the state department of taxation shows that currently he has paid the taxes 
for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010. He made a payment of $49 on June 25, 
2014, which paid his 2013 state income tax in full. In July, August and September, 
he paid a total of $150 toward his 2011 state tax debt. As of September 23, 2014, 
he owed $383 in delinquent state taxes for tax years 2011, and $219 for 2012. 
(Answer; AE D, F) 
 
 Applicant’s June 2013 personal financial statement (PFS) shows that he 
and his wife earned net monthly income of $7,580. At that time, he estimated 
monthly expenses of $2,825, debt payments of $626, and a monthly net 
remainder (MNR) of $4,129. However, at the hearing, Applicant testified that the 
2013 PFS was inaccurate. After the hearing, he provided pay statements showing 
he and his wife currently earn monthly net income of $7,237. He also provided an 
updated budget, which includes the $450 monthly IRS payment and $50 monthly 
state payment. It shows a detailed list of monthly expenses, which total $7,309. 
His current MNR is negative $74. (GE 2; AE H, I, J; Tr. 82-94) 
                                                 
6 Applicant's documentation shows his tax preparation service billed him for the 2008 tax return 
preparation on August 25, 2011. (AE N) 
 
7 Applicant filed his 2013 federal return timely, on April 7, 2014. (AE K) 
 
 
5 
 Applicant provided character reference letters, which describe him as 
having exceptional integrity, a strong work ethic, subject-matter expertise, and 
professionalism. A former military officer and current project manager, who works 
with him daily, describes him as honest and trustworthy, and recommends him 
for a security clearance. His facility security officer notes that Applicant is a 
dedicated worker with good moral character. In 2009 and 2010, Applicant was 
inducted into a group of high achievers in his company. He has received 
numerous certificates of appreciation for his contributions to U.S. military 
missions overseas. (AE A, B, M) 
 
Policies 
 
Each security clearance decision must be a fair and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material 
information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and policy in the AG.8 
Decisions must reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the 
Guidelines, commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept. The presence 
or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not determine a 
conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
are followed when a case can be measured against them as they represent 
policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
In this case, the pleadings and the information presented require consideration of 
the adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations).   
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest9 for an applicant to either 
receive or continue to have access to classified information. The Government 
must produce admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to 
deny or revoke a security clearance. Additionally, the Government must prove 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, then 
the applicant must refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case. Because 
no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of 
persuasion.10 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust. The Government has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as her or his own. 
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of 
any reasonable doubt about suitability for access in favor of the Government.11

Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
AG ¶18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial 
considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and 
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of 
which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An 
individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . 
 
 Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2004 
through 2012. He also failed to file his state income tax returns for tax years 2005 
through 2010. He currently owes approximately $30,000 in federal taxes and 
$600 in state taxes. The record supports application of the following disqualifying 
conditions under AG ¶19: 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required. . . .  
 
 The Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can 
mitigate security concerns. I have considered the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 
20, especially the following: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant’s failure to file returns began in 2005, with his failure to file his 
2004 federal return, and it continued to 2011, when he filed his first delinquent 
return. His failure to meet his duty to file income tax returns is not recent. 
However, it was frequent, because it involved returns for numerous years. The 
fact that Applicant did little during a period of six years to investigate the validity 
of information from coworkers about his tax obligations casts doubt on his 
reliability and judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) applies where an individual experiences events over which he 
had no control, and which affected his finances. Nothing in the evidence 
indicates that events beyond Applicant’s control caused him to fail to timely file 
his income tax returns. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply.  
 
 Applicant contacted the IRS, worked with the agency on his delinquencies, 
and received advice on how to resolve them. He has paid back state taxes for 
four tax years, and is making payments on his federal and remaining state 
delinquencies. However, his current PFS, including the $450 monthly payment to 
the IRS and the $50 payment to the state, shows a negative monthly remainder. 
Applicant's ability to maintain his payment plans is unclear. Applicant receives 
partial credit under AG ¶ 20(c).  
 
 Applicant cannot receive full credit for a good-faith effort to meet his tax 
obligations. The Appeal Board has defined “good faith” as, “[r]easonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.”12 Here, Applicant failed 
in his civic obligations when he did not investigate or confirm the advice of his 
coworkers regarding his tax obligations; as a result, his tax returns went unfiled 
for years. He did not file his first delinquent return until two years after he 
returned to the United States, after the IRS filed a tax lien against him. At the 
time of his security interview in 2012, he had filed one delinquent return; he 
stated he would file the remaining returns over the next several months, but he 
failed to do so. His 2004, 2005, and 2006 returns were not filed until 2012. 
Although his state income taxes were relatively small, his state tax payment 
agreement was not established until May 2014. Only limited mitigation is 
available under AG ¶ 20(d).

Whole-Person Analysis 
  
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate 
the applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited 
guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in 
light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  
 
I have considered the positive aspects of Appellant's history. He is a 
responsible husband and father, and is in the process of earning a bachelor’s 
degree. He provided laudatory character references. He has worked with 
defense contractors for more than a decade, and has been acknowledged for 
providing outstanding support to U.S. military forces. He has established 
payment plans for his federal and state taxes, and made payments on his 
delinquencies. 
 
 When Applicant worked for defense contractors overseas, he was in his 
twenties. He showed immaturity by accepting the statements of coworkers about 
his tax obligations, without further investigation. Even after his return to the 
United States, he did not take appropriate action regarding for his federal and 
state tax obligations. He failed to demonstrate reliability when he waited two 
years to file his first delinquent return, after the IRS issued a tax lien in 2011. 
 
 Applicant owes approximately $30,000 in back taxes to the federal 
government. The delinquencies have been paid in part through seizure of tax 
refunds. Although he has begun payment plans with the IRS and the state, he did 
not begin them until 2014. It appears that Applicant is currently operating at a 
deficit each month, and it is unclear if he will be able to maintain his payment 
plans.  
 
 
 
9 
 The Appeal Board had held,  
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s 
judgment, reliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. 
[citations omitted] . . . Indeed, the Board has previously noted that a 
person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal obligations to file 
income tax returns may be said not to have demonstrated the high 
degree of judgment and reliability required for access to classified 
information.13 
 
 The evidence at this time fails to satisfy the doubts raised about 
Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the financial considerations 
guideline.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant 
access to classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is 
denied.
