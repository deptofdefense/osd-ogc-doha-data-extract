MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant defaulted on about $43,126 in consumer credit obligations between 2009 
and 2010. As of September 2013, he had reduced a $1,933 charged-off balance to $90.85, 
and a $2,627 debt had been paid after collection. He failed to corroborate claimed 
payments of $9,200 toward $16,116 in collection balances or the elimination of other debts 
through his spouse’s bankruptcy filing. More documented progress of debt resolution is 
needed before I can conclude that his financial problems are safely in the past. Clearance 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 4, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and explaining why it was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance. The DOD CAF took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
 
 2 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on March 7, 2014. On March 14, 2014, 
Applicant indicated that he would accept the opinion of a Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge based upon review of the written record. On March 
31, 2014, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of ten 
exhibits (Items 1-10). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed 
him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on April 8, 2014. 
On April 14, 2014, he submitted his rebuttal. On April 18, 2014, Department Counsel 
indicated the Government had no objections to its admission. 
 
On April 29, 2014, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
On review of the file, I accepted Applicant’s rebuttal to the FORM into the record as 
Applicant exhibit (AE) A. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of February 4, 2014, Applicant owed 
$51,013 in delinquent debt that had been charged off (SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.f) or placed for 
collection (SOR 1.d-1.e and 1.g-1.k). (Item 1.) In his Answer, Applicant admitted all the 
debts, although he believed that SOR 1.d and 1.h were the same debt. He added that he 
had paid $550 on another account that had been delinquent in the amount of $822, and 
that the debts in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k were included in his spouse’s bankruptcy 
filed in February 2014. When he declined a hearing, he explained that most of his available 
money had been spent helping a young man. (Item 3.) 
 
After considering the Government’s FORM, including Applicant’s Answer (Item 3), 
and Applicant’s rebuttal (AE A) to the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 70-year-old married electronic technician. He served in the United 
States military for 20 years, from 1962 to 1982. In July 1982, he began working for a 
defense contractor. He was with the company over 19 years when his then employer lost 
the contract to Applicant’s current employer in February 2002. Applicant has held a DOD 
Top Secret clearance since January 2003. (Items 4, 10.) 
 
On December 15, 2008, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his DOD security clearance eligibility. He 
responded negatively to whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in 
the last seven years and to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debts. (Item 4.) 
 
As of December 19, 2008, Applicant was making timely payments on a joint car loan 
taken out in February 2007 for $19,155, to be repaid at $344 per month; on a second joint 
car loan taken out in January 2008 for $23,428, to be repaid at $435 per month; on a joint 
mortgage balance of $277,029; and on $30,776 in credit card balances on nine accounts in 
his name. He had no delinquent accounts on his credit record. (Item 5.) 
 
 3 
Around August 2008, Applicant’s spouse promised to help care for a friend’s 
grandson, who had drug-related legal problems. Applicant asserts, without corroboration, 
that he and his spouse spent about $90,000 of their own money
1
 in legal fees, court fines, 
and warrants for the young man, who died of a drug overdose in January 2011. This 
unreimbursed expenditure caused Applicant to fall behind on his own accounts. (Item 10.) 
 
On November 22, 2010, an incident report was submitted to the DOD CAF 
indicating that Applicant was delinquent on most of his financial obligations and that his 
automobile had been repossessed. (Item 6.) A check of Applicant’s credit on February 18, 
2011, revealed that Applicant had been chronically past due 30 days in his payment of the 
February 2007 auto loan, but it was now current. The other car loan had been charged off 
in July 2010 in the amount of $15,494 (SOR 1.f). He had defaulted on his and his spouse’s 
mortgage payments of $1,382 per month, and around June 2010, their mortgage lender 
had foreclosed on their home to settle the debt. In addition, several credit card accounts 
had been charged off or placed for collection starting in 2009. (Item 7.) The delinquencies 
are shown in the following table.

In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant stated that he, his spouse, and the woman’s grandson spent altogether 
“5,000,000 plus dimes at least” (AE A), which is considerably more than what he told the OPM investigator. He 
did not provide any corroborating documentation of court costs, attorney fees, or other expenditures for the 
woman’s grandson.

On March 16, 2011, Applicant was interviewed about his adverse credit accounts by 
an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant 
acknowledged that his account with the lender in SOR 1.a was in collection, and that his 
vehicle (SOR 1.f) was repossessed in 2010. He claimed that the accounts in SOR 1.b-1.e, 
1.g, and 1.i-1.k were in his spouse’s name, and that he knew no details about the debts. 
Applicant also indicated that he and his spouse had a home loan foreclosed in 2010. They 
owed about $190,000 on the mortgage, and the house sold for $70,000. She had been 
living in the home while Applicant occupied a separate residence, which he had paid off in 
1995. After the foreclosure, she cohabited with Applicant until February 2011, when she 
went to stay with one of her sons out of state. Applicant asserted that the delinquencies 
 
 5 
were beyond his control. He did not intend to fall behind on his financial obligations in the 
future, but he also did not intend at present to repay his past-due debts. He was 
contemplating whether to pursue bankruptcy. On his monthly gross income of $8,200 
($6,500 from employment and $1,700 in military pension) and his spouse’s $3,500 monthly 
social security and unemployment benefits, Applicant estimated their joint net income at 
$8,200. Their monthly living expenses and current debt payment totaled $440. His reported 
assets included one acre of land and a trailer valued at $45,000, checking account 
deposits of $1,500, a classic airplane worth $60,000, and a car valued at $7,000. (Item 10.) 
 
As of September 9, 2013, Applicant’s credit record showed the past-due balances 
alleged in SOR 1.a-1.f. The accounts in SOR 1.g and 1.h reportedly had zero balances 
after being charged off and transferred or sold. The accounts in SOR 1.i-1.k were no longer 
on his credit record. (Item 8.) 
 
On September 11, 2013, the DOD CAF asked Applicant about any efforts to resolve 
his delinquent debts since his March 2011 interview. (Item 9.) In response, Applicant 
provided a credit report of September 22, 2013, showing the unpaid balances in SOR 1.a-
1.f, but no new delinquencies. Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement on 
October 2, 2013. He reported joint monthly income after deductions of $8,659.78 and 
monthly expenses of $1,807. As for debt payments, he indicated that he had paid off the 
debt in SOR 1.e on September 30, 2013, and that he was scheduled to begin making $950 
monthly payments on the collection debt in SOR 1.d on October 10, 2013, although the 
arrangement was “on hold for Gov. 10/01 layoff.” (Item 10.) 
 
Applicant’s spouse apparently filed for bankruptcy around February 20, 2014. He 
expects all of the remaining past-due debt on his record to be eliminated through her 
bankruptcy discharge anticipated around May 2014.
2
 As of April 14, 2014, she was still 
living apart from Applicant. She lives on a social security benefit of $1,050 per month and 
on what Applicant provides for her subsistence. (AE A.) 
 
Applicant has not had any credit counseling. He lives frugally and no longer uses 
any credit cards. He keeps between $3,000 and $5,000 in his checking account. He plans 
to retire in September or October 2014, although if he should lose his security clearance 
access eligibility, he intends to retire immediately, sell his assets, and move from his area. 
Applicant has four vehicles:  a 1976 truck with poor gas mileage; a 1979 sports car that he 
considers unreliable for all but local travel; a 2005 car with low mileage; and a 2007 car for 
commuting. He still has an old airplane that he bought around 1972. He had hoped to fly it 
someday but it needs more repairs than he had planned, so he may sell parts. Applicant 
has a 401(k) account, in which he has “a few dollars.” (AE A.) 
                                                 
2 
In the FORM, Department Counsel expressly encouraged Applicant to submit documentation of any 
payments on his debts. Applicant presented no documentation to verify payments or his spouse’s bankruptcy 
filing, so it is unclear which debts, if any, would be eliminated in a Chapter 7 discharge. With the exception of 
the debt in SOR 1.b, on which he was an authorized user per his December 2008 (Item 5) and February 2011 
(Item 7) credit reports, the accounts were opened jointly or in his name only. He is legally liable for repayment, 
even assuming that his spouse ran up the debt on some of his accounts. See AE A (“I found it hard to 
understand how my wife could amass so much debt on some of the credit cards before it was shut off.”).

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns about financial considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
 
 7 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Between 2009 and 2010, Applicant defaulted on ten consumer credit accounts in his 
name, including a car loan opened jointly. Around $43,126 of delinquent debt was charged 
off or placed for collection. Another credit card account, on which he was an authorized 
user, was charged off in the amount of $635 (SOR 1.b). Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 
19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply. The evidence also shows that he and his spouse lost a home 
to foreclosure around June 2010, after they fell behind in the mortgage payments. While 
the property sold for around $70,000, when they owed about $190,000 on the loan (Item 
10), there is no evidence that the lender is pursuing them for the deficiency balance. Even 
so, it shows the extent to which Applicant and his spouse were willing to go to make good 
on a promise to his spouse’s friend.
3
 
 
Applicant’s financial problems are too recurrent and recent to fully apply mitigating 
condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” All of the accounts 
became delinquent in 2009 or 2010, and several had not been paid as of the SOR. With 
the exception of the debt in SOR 1.b, on which he was an authorized user, he was legally 
liable to pay the delinquent balances, even if they were incurred by his spouse on his 
accounts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” is not sufficiently established. Applicant’s sole explanation for 
falling behind is that he and his spouse spent around $90,000 in legal costs for a young 
man that his spouse had promised to help. Even assuming Applicant believed in good faith 
that he and his spouse would eventually be reimbursed, one has to question Applicant’s 
financial judgment in paying as much as $90,000, if not more, in legal fees and fines for a 
young man who was in and out of jail for drug offenses, especially when the support came 
at a cost to Applicant’s own credit worthiness. 
                                                 
3 
The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). The mortgage cannot provide a separate basis for 
disqualification since it was not alleged in the SOR, but it is still relevant to assessing Applicant’s financial 
judgment generally. In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant stated, “I bet my wife wishes that she had done more to 
protect our future and [the young man’s].” (AE A.) Even if his spouse is primarily liable for exhausting their 
assets for the benefit of this young man, Applicant bears some responsibility for not limiting the financial 
support.   
 
 8 
As of September 2013, the collection agent for the debt in SOR 1.a was reporting 
only $90.85 owed on an account charged off in the amount of $1,933. The credit bureaus 
were reporting a $317 past-due balance on that account, although it is likely that the debt 
status had not been updated on his credit record. Applicant maintains that he satisfied the 
debt on September 16, 2013. He provided no corroboration of the payment, although 
payments have obviously been made to reduce the balance from $1,933 in February 2010 
to $317 as of August 2013. Another debt, of $2,627 (SOR 1.g), is shown as paid after 
collection on Applicant’s credit record as of February 22, 2013.
4
  AG ¶ 20(c), “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” are 
partially implicated by payments to resolve the delinquencies in SOR 1.a and 1.g. When he 
answered the SOR, Applicant indicated that he had made payments of $950 each between 
October 2013 and February 2014 toward the collection debt in SOR 1.d and that he had 
made a debit payment of $4,450 toward the collection balance in SOR 1.e. He provided no 
corroboration of those payments, which, if made, would fall short of fully satisfying the 
debts without some evidence of an agreement by the creditor to accept less than the full 
balance in settlement. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any payments on the credit 
card account in SOR 1.c, for which he is individually responsible, or on the automobile loan 
in SOR 1.f, which is a joint debt. Neither AG ¶ 20(c) nor AG ¶ 20(d) is satisfied as to those 
delinquencies. 
 
Applicant indicated that he expects the debts in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, to be 
discharged in his spouse’s bankruptcy. There is no confirmation that those accounts have 
been included in a bankruptcy filing. Since Applicant was only an authorized user on the 
account identified in SOR 1.b, it may well be covered in a bankruptcy filing by his spouse. 
As of February 2011, the credit reporting agencies were showing that Applicant was 
contractually liable for a $2,110 collection balance (SOR 1.i) and a $645 medical debt in 
collection (SOR 1.j). It is unclear whether his spouse has any legal liability for those debts.  
The $3,613 charged-off credit card debt (SOR 1.c) and $507 collection balance (SOR 1.k) 
are reportedly Applicant’s individual responsibility (Item 7), so they would presumably not 
be covered by her bankruptcy. Available documentation is insufficient to show that most of 
the debts in the SOR are not his responsibility. Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(e), “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the 
dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” applies only to the debts in 
SOR 1.b and 1.h. Whereas Applicant is listed as only an authorized user on the account in 
SOR 1.b, I accept that the credit card belongs to his spouse and that she incurred the debt. 
The debt in SOR 1.h is duplicated in SOR 1.d and does not represent an additional 
                                                 
4 
In the FORM, Department Counsel inaccurately indicated that the account in SOR 1.g was listed as a $2,100 
past-due balance on Applicant’s September 22, 2013 credit report. (Item 10.) Both Experian and Equifax 
reported the balance as $0.00. Experian reported $2,100 as the credit limit while Equifax reported $2,100 as 
the high balance on the account. Both Experian and Equifax indicated the debt as charged off and transferred. 
Trans Union reported a high balance of $2,627, a credit limit of $2,100, and a current balance of $0.00, and 
paid after charge-off/collection. The credit report relied on by the Government does not establish a current 
delinquency on the account in SOR 1.g. 
 
 
 9 
delinquency. Nonetheless, the financial concerns raised by his record of delinquent 
accounts are only partially mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept  
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).

Applicant brought on his financial problems. He failed to limit the expenses paid for 
a young man in legal difficulty. If Applicant’s spouse incurred much of the credit card debt 
on his record, then he bears responsibility for not controlling her access to his personal 
credit. Consequences of his extremely poor financial judgment included the loss of the 
home that his spouse occupied and the repossession of a vehicle. Several consumer credit 
card accounts in his name were charged off or placed for collection as well.  
 
Applicant is not required to resolve all of his delinquent debts before he can be 
granted security clearance eligibility. Even so, the DOHA Appeal Board has required that 
an applicant demonstrate that he has a realistic plan established to resolve his financial 
problems and that he has taken significant actions to implement that plan. See ISCR Case 
No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Even if I accept 
his uncorroborated claims of payment on some $16,116.97 in collection debt (SOR 1.d and 
1.e), Applicant has no plan in place to resolve the $15,494 car loan balance on his credit 
record. Weighing in his favor, Applicant has a long history of employment in the defense 
industry following his retirement from the United States military. At the same time, it is well 
settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See 
Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990.). For the reasons noted above, 
based on the facts before me and the adjudicative guidelines that I am required to 
consider, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant’s security clearance eligibility at this time.
