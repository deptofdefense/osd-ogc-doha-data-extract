GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 28, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on July 22, 2013.2 On September 
25, 2013, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For

Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 
1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF adjudicators could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In addition to the SOR, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as 
the ‘Guidelines’ applicable to his case. It appears, however, that the version of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines furnished was an outdated, superseded version of Enclosure 2 
of the Directive.3 The result of that action was that Applicant may have relied on 
modified, but incorrect, adjudicative guidelines when he responded to the SOR. In a 
statement notarized October 17, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was prepared by the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The FORM was provided to Applicant on 
December 5, 2013, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on December 24, 2013. However, on February 
13, 2014, because of the issue pertaining to the outdated, superseded version of 
Enclosure 2, Department Counsel furnished the correct version and afforded Applicant 
an additional 30 days to submit another response to the FORM. Applicant’s response 
was due on April 26, 2014, but on January 12, 2014, he submitted his only response, 
supported by documentation,5 to which Department Counsel offered no objection. No 
supplemental response to the FORM was ever received. The case was assigned to me 
on May 1, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the four factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.). He denied 
SOR ¶ 1.c. Applicant’s admissions and other comments are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:

Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as an installation technician since July 2002. He was previously employed as a 
driver.6 He was laid off due to a lack of work in January 2002, and remained 
unemployed until July 2002.7 Applicant has never served in the U.S. military.8 He 
dropped out of high school, but received a General Educational Development (GED) 
diploma in April 1995, and did not attend college.9 Applicant was married in September 
2006.10 He has one daughter and one son from a prior relationship, born in September 
1992 and January 1994, as well as a stepson, born in July 1991.11 He has held a secret 
security clearance since September 2002.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until July 2011. In 2006 or 
2007, Applicant began rebuilding a 30-year-old rental property and he subsequently 
obtained a loan of $100,000. The drawings and the actual start of construction took one 
and one-half years    much longer than he had anticipated. When he paid off his credit 
card accounts, his credit line was decreased dramatically, leaving him without the 
anticipated resources to retire the loan. In addition, his tenants were unable to pay the 
monthly rent of $1,200, and they vacated the residence in September 2011. Applicant’s 
monthly mortgage payment was $2,193, and without the rental payments, he was 
required to use his own resources to make the entire monthly mortgage payment. The 
combination of a reduced credit line and the absence of rent made it difficult for him to 
do so. Applicant used the construction loan and funds from his wife’s 401(k) to pay the 
family bills. He searched for new renters and tried refinancing his family residence. 
Nevertheless, at some point, because of insufficient money to continue making all of his 
monthly payments, some of his accounts became delinquent, placed for collection, or 
were charged off.  
 
Applicant hoped to lower his monthly mortgage payments on his family 
residence, considered selling his two properties or allowing them to go into foreclosure, 
but decided against doing so for sentimental reasons. He also rejected the possibility of 
bankruptcy.13 Applicant contacted his creditors and, when he was able to do so, he 
entered into repayment arrangements and brought some accounts into a current status.

From some creditors, he sought to obtain a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt. In 
October 2013, he finally sold his rental property.14 At one point, the DOD CAF was 
interested in nine of Applicant’s purportedly delinquent accounts. 
 
The SOR identified four delinquent debts totaling $338,414 that had been past 
due, placed for collection, or charged off, as generally reflected by credit reports from 
July 2002,15 October 2011,16 February 2013,17 July 2013,18 and December 2013.19 
Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the 
credit reports, in some instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the 
same creditor name or under a different creditor name. Several accounts are listed with 
only partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective 
current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence already in the case file, 
and Applicant’s submissions regarding the same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) There is a department store charge account (used for the purchase 
of several large appliances) with a credit limit of $4,150, high credit of $6,175, and an 
unpaid balance of $4,838, that was 120 days past due in the amount of $868.20 The 
account was charged off and eventually transferred or sold to a debt purchaser.21 The 
account balance is now zero.22 In October 2013, Applicant indicated that he was in the 
process of seeking a Form 1099-C,23 but in January 2014, he was unable to furnish a 
copy of one, claiming that during the period January through April 2014, he would be 
addressing the debt.24 Although there is no evidence of any subsequent action taken by 
Applicant, since the December 2013 credit report reflects a zero balance, I conclude 
that the account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.) There is an electronics company-sponsored bank credit card 
account (used for the purchase of a stereo system) with a balance of $4,747 that was 
180 days past due when it was closed by the creditor and placed for collection in August

2011.25 Two months after receiving the account, the collection agent increased the high 
credit, balance, and past due balance to $4,884.26 In less than two years, the collection 
agent had increased the high credit, balance, and past-due balance to $6,327.27 In 
October 2013, Applicant indicated that he was in the process of seeking a Form 1099-
C,28 but in January 2014, he was unable to furnish a copy of one, claiming that during 
the period January through April 2014, he would be addressing the debt.29 There is no 
evidence of any subsequent action taken by Applicant to resolve the debt. The account 
has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is an unspecified type of account with an unidentified creditor 
that was transferred, sold, or placed for collection with a debt purchaser. The debt 
purchaser reported that the account had a high credit of $5,121, and past due and 
unpaid balances of $5,604.30 In June 2013, the debt purchaser filed a law suit against 
Applicant seeking an unspecified amount.31 The matter was continued to February 
2014. Applicant disputed the account, claiming it is the same account as that alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a. The identity of the creditor of that account is known, but the identity of the 
creditor of the other account is not. The credit reports reflect different account numbers. 
In the absence of additional documentation clarifying the disputed issues, it is 
impossible to determine if Applicant’s contentions are supported. Accordingly, I 
conclude that the account has not been resolved.  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a conventional home mortgage account on Applicant’s 
rental property with a high credit of $340,000 and a balance of $326,778 that was past 
due $2,193 in August 2011.32 By May 2013, the past due balance had increased to 
$46,018, and the foreclosure process had started.33 Applicant approached the mortgage 
lender about the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Short Sale Program 
in mid-2013,34 and by October 2013, a short sale of the property had been approved by 
the mortgage lender. On October 25, 2013, Applicant sold his rental property for 
$231,994.64.35 There is now a zero balance,36 and the account has been resolved.

 In July 2013, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement. At that time, 
Applicant’s family monthly net income was $6,862.81. With monthly household 
expenses, mortgage, and debt payments, totaling $7,241.72, he had a net deficit of 
approximately $378.91.37 With only $200 in savings, it is unclear what the impact of the 
sale of his rental property may have been on Applicant’s finances, or how he manages 
to make all of his monthly payments. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant 
ever received financial counseling. 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”38 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”39   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”40 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
 
7 
                                      
 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.41  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”42 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”43 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In September 2011, Applicant found himself with insufficient funds to 
continue making his routine monthly payments, various accounts became delinquent, 
and they were placed for collection or charged off. One account entered into the 
foreclosure process. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.44  
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2011 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he 
seemingly did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were in 
some measure beyond Applicant’s control. Applicant had previously obtained a loan for 
$100,000 to rebuild his rental property, and during the planning and rebuilding stages, 
                                                          
44
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

he managed to pay off a number of credit card accounts. When he did so, his credit 
lines were decreased. Commencing in 2011, Applicant started experiencing some 
financial difficulties when his tenants were unable to continue paying their monthly rent 
and vacated the rental property. It became necessary for him to make the monthly 
mortgage payments of $2,193 entirely from his own available funds. However, with the 
reduced income from the loss of the rent, and diminished capability for obtaining 
additional capital because of the decreased credit lines, he was unable to do so. As a 
result, some accounts became delinquent, placed for collection, or were charged off. 
The rental property entered into the foreclosure process.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts and working 
with his creditors.45 He contacted his creditors and, when he was able to do so, he 
entered into repayment arrangements and brought some accounts into a current status. 
He used funds from his wife’s 401(k) to pay the family bills. He searched for new renters 
and tried refinancing his family residence. Applicant apparently resolved his non-SOR 
accounts, and then focused on his largest account - the home mortgage on the rental 
property - that had entered into the foreclosure process. The mortgage lender approved 
a short sale and the property was withdrawn from foreclosure and eventually sold, 
leaving Applicant with a zero balance. Unable to pay off two SOR accounts, he has 
been seeking Forms 1099-C from the two creditors, including one whose account had 
been sold to a debt purchaser. Applicant contends that two of the SOR accounts are 
actually the same account, although the credit reports reflect different account numbers 
and identify the creditors as one vendor and one debt purchaser. As indicated above, in 
the absence of additional documentation clarifying the disputed issues, it is impossible 
to determine if Applicant’s contentions are supported. It is unclear what the impact of 
the sale of Applicant’s rental property may have been on Applicant’s finances, or how 
he manages to make all of his monthly payments. While there is no evidence that he 
has ever received financial counseling, there are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are now under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.46 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.47       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off. One account entered into the 
foreclosure process.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were in some measure 
beyond Applicant’s control. In 2011, Applicant’s tenants were unable to continue paying 
their monthly rent and vacated his rental property. The reduced income from the loss of 
the rent, the diminished capability for obtaining additional capital because of the 
decreased credit lines, and the exhaustion of his wife’s 401(k) funds, resulted in an 
inability to maintain his accounts in a current status. Accounts became delinquent, 
placed for collection, or were charged off. The rental property entered into the 
foreclosure process. Applicant did not ignore his creditors. He searched for new renters, 
tried refinancing his family residence, resolved his non-SOR accounts, and then focused 
on the home mortgage on the rental property, to save it from foreclosure. He was 
successful, and the property was sold, leaving Applicant with a zero balance. Applicant’s 
efforts have not ceased, but he has vowed to continue attempting to resolve the few 
remaining accounts. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:48 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of

 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue 
his debt resolution efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his 
future eligibility for a security clearance.49 Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
       
  
                                                          
49
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); 
ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
