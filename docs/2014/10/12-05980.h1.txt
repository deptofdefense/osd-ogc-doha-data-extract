HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts totaling $85,123. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
his progress in resolving his financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 27, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 5) On July 17, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On August 7, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated September 15, 2014, was provided to him on September 23, 2014.1 On 
September 29, 2014, Applicant responded to the FORM. The case was assigned to me 
on October 9, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a-1.g.3 He also provided some extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old engineer, who has worked for a defense contractor 
since October 2011.4 He attended a state university from 2001 to 2008, and he received 
a bachelor’s degree in 2008. In November 2010, Applicant married. He does not have 
any children.  
 
Applicant has never served in the military. From December 2004 to present, he 
has been self-employed in on-line marketing. He also worked from January 2009 to 
October 2011, for a retail tire sales company, and from October 2011 to present, he was 
employed as a simulator technician. He was unemployed for four months in 2008, for 
nine months in 2007, and for nine months in 2006. His unemployment in 2006, 2007, 
and 2008 was due to school attendance. There is no evidence of security violations, 
criminal conduct, use of illegal drugs, or alcohol abuse.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and the SOR allege, and Applicant admits, 
responsibility for seven delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts totaling $85,123 
as follows: (1) ¶ 1.a ($18,657) is a judgment owed to a bank; (2) ¶ 1.b ($7,769) is a 
charged-off student loan debt; (3) ¶ 1.c ($19,564) is a charged-off bank debt; (4) ¶ 1.d 
($19,433) is a charged-off bank debt;  (5) ¶ 1.e ($13,828) is a charged-off bank debt; (6) 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 17, 
2014, and Applicant’s receipt is dated September 23, 2014. The DOHA transmittal letter informed 
Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response. (Item 4)   
 
4Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s January 27, 2012 SF 86 is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph and the next paragraph. (Item 5)

¶ 1.f ($4,354) is a charged-off bank debt; and (7) 1.g ($1,518) is a collection debt. (Item 
1)  
 
When Applicant completed his January 27, 2012 SF 86, he disclosed 10 
delinquent debts. (Item 5) He stated that for eight of his debts he was “in [the] process 
of arranging payments.” For two student loan debts, totaling $26,652 and $128,476, he 
was in debt “[c]onsolidation and in [the] process of arranging payments.” (Item 5)  When 
he responded to the SOR on August 8, 2014, he indicated his delinquent debts were 
generated for education and living expenses while he was attending a university and 
earning his bachelor’s degree in engineering. (Item 4) He intended to pay his debts and 
was current on a portion of his student loans. (Item 4) He has two car loans and other 
bills that he is current on and has been making payments. He concluded: 
 
I do demonstrate self-control, trustworthiness, and a willingness to abide 
by rules and regulations. I am no longer financially overextended in my 
daily functions, as I was while obtaining my degree. I do not gamble and 
strive daily to be a better employee than yesterday so that I may continue 
to advance in my current[] workplace. (Item 4) 
 
Notice to Applicant of Necessity for Additional Information 
 
The FORM notes that Applicant has not submitted any evidence that “he has 
attempted to satisfy the judgment or that he has contacted any of the creditors listed in 
the SOR. Nor has he presented any evidence that he has made any payments on, or 
made any payments for, the accounts at issue.” (FORM at 6). The FORM states: 
 
Applicant's overall unresolved indebtedness remains a lingering concern 
impacting his eligibility for a security clearance. In the absence of 
additional documentary evidence, submitted in response to this 
FORM, to show that Applicant has been able to begin [to] regain some 
financial stability by establishing a meaningful track record of 
resolving his delinquent debts, this concern must be decided against 
him in evaluating his suitability to have access to classified 
information. FORM at 6-7 (emphasis in original). 
 
Applicant’s FORM in its concluding paragraph repeated the admonition about the 
absence of corroborating documentation and other mitigating information and explained 
that Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a 
documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or 
explanation, as appropriate. . . If you do not file any objections or submit any additional 
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a 
determination based solely on this FORM.” (FORM at 7-8) Applicant responded to the 
FORM, “I have reviewed the relevant material in the case concerning my security 
clearance and I have no objections or any information I wish to be considered.” (FORM 
response)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
two credit reports and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleges seven delinquent, 
collection, or charged-off accounts totaling $85,123. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to any of his SOR debts. He did not provide 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

sufficient information about his finances to establish his inability to make greater 
progress paying his creditors. His decision to accrue substantial student loan debt is an 
appropriate decision. His underemployment and unemployment damaged his family 
finances and are circumstances largely beyond his control; however, he did not act 
responsibly under the circumstances. He did not establish his income over the last three 
years or show what his spouse earned or how she contributed to the family financial 
situation. He did not provide a family budget. He presented insufficient evidence about 
what he has done over the last two years to pay his SOR debts or his other debts.     
 
 Applicant did not provide any of the following documentation relating to the SOR 
creditors: (1) proof of payments such as checking account statements, photocopies of 
checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the 
creditor; (2) correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact 
with the creditor;6 (3) a credible debt dispute; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, 
such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve 
these SOR debts; (5) evidence of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence of progress 
or resolution of his SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence that he was unable to 
make greater progress resolving his delinquent debts, or that his financial problems are 
being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the 
circumstances, he failed to establish that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
                                            
6 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 31-year-old engineer, who has worked for a defense contractor since 2011. He 
attended a state university from 2001 to 2008, and he received a bachelor’s degree in 
2008. In November 2010, Applicant married. From October 2011 to present, he was 
employed as a simulator technician for a defense contractor. Underemployment and 
unemployment are circumstances beyond his control that contributed to his financial 
problems. Accrual of substantial student loan-related debt is an appropriate decision. 
There is no evidence of security violations, criminal conduct, use of illegal drugs, or 
alcohol abuse. He disclosed his financial problems on his January 27, 2012 SF 86.  
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His SOR alleges 
seven delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts totaling $85,123. He failed to 
provide sufficient documentation of progress to resolve his financial problems. He was 
well aware of his financial problems, as he listed them in his January 27, 2012 SF 86. 
His failure to provide more corroborating documentation shows lack of financial 
responsibility and lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. 
More information about inability to pay debts or documented financial progress is 
necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
