Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven delinquent collection 
debts for $17,093. Two debts are disputed; and five debts are paid. If the two disputes 
are unsuccessful, he promised to pay the debts.  He has a track record of paying his 
debts. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust 
position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 6, 2013, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (GE 1) On May 8, 2014, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, 
pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, 
and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 
1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by 
the President on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. 
(HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. 
 
On June 26, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On September 4, 2014, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
September 4, 2014, the case was assigned to me. On September 10, 2014, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for October 2, 2014. The hearing was held 
as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits, and Applicant 
offered seven exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 17-19; GE 1-3; AE A-
G) On October 3, 2014, Applicant provided four exhibits, which were admitted without 
objection. (AE G-J). On October 10, 2014, I received the transcript of the hearing. On 
October 24, 2014, Applicant provided one exhibit, which was admitted without objection. 
(AE K)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.g; however, he explained that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g duplicated the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. 
He also provided mitigating information on the other debts. His admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 25-year-old hospital worker employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 
5) In 2007, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6, 16) He received a bachelor of art 
degree in mathematics in 2013. (Tr. 6) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has 
never been married; however, he is engaged to be married. (Tr. 6) He does not have 
any children. (Tr. 6) He came to the United States from a country in Africa in 2007. (Tr. 
15) His parents reside in the United States. (Tr. 16) In 2010, his father had a stroke and 
is in a nursing home. (Tr. 16) There is no evidence of reportable criminal offenses, 
alcohol or drug abuse, or violations of his employment rules.    
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his November 20, 2013 
credit report, SOR response, and hearing transcript. His SOR alleges seven delinquent 
collection debts for $17,093 as follows: ¶ 1.a ($7,663) from a car repossessed in 2010; 
¶ 1.b ($30) store debt; ¶ 1.c ($1,560) bank debt; ¶ 1.d ($3,282) telecommunications 
debt; ¶ 1.e ($956) bank debt; ¶ 1.f ($2,564) credit card debt; and ¶ 1.g ($1,038) bank 
debt.    
 
 Applicant was unemployed in 2009 and 2010, and he was unable to pay his 
debts. (Tr. 22-23; SOR response) He returned to college and obtained part-time 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

employment. (Tr. 24-25) In 2009 and 2010, his accounts fell into arrears. He received 
financial counseling. (Tr. 21) He has been employed since October 2013 with a defense 
contractor. (Tr. 21) His current annual salary is $64,000. (Tr. 22)  
 
 In 2007, Applicant purchased a vehicle. (Tr. 26) He was unable to make the 
payments, and the vehicle was repossessed in 2010. (Tr. 26) At the time the vehicle 
was repossessed, he thought that he would not owe anything after they sold the vehicle. 
(Tr. 31) In June, 2014, Applicant paid the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a $1,916, and the creditor 
wrote that the debt was reduced to $5,747. (SOR response at 17-23) On August 1, 
2014, the creditor wrote that the debt was paid and settled. (Tr. 31-32; AE K at 8)  
 
On June 23, 2014, he paid the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b $30, and resolved the debt. 
(Tr. 32-33; SOR response at 24) On June 19, 2014, Applicant paid the creditor in SOR 
¶ 1.c $1,091 and resolved the debt. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response at 12-13)  
 
On June 25, 2014, the creditor wrote that Applicant owes $3,282 on the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.d. (AE H) Applicant disputed the debt, but said if his dispute was unsuccessful, 
he would pay the debt by the end of 2014. (Tr. 34-35; AE H, I) On June 20, 2014, 
Applicant paid the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e $352 and resolved the debt. (Tr. 37-38; SOR 
response at 15) 
 
 On June 20, 2014, Applicant received a settlement agreement from the creditor 
in SOR ¶ 1.f suggesting several payment options to address a debt for $2,618. (Tr. 38-
39; AE G) On October 24, 2014, the creditor wrote, stating the “account is now 
considered settled in full” in return for one $2,000 payment. (AE K) Applicant said in an 
October 24, 2014 email that he had paid the debt. (AE K)  
 
 Applicant believed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g was the same debt as the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.e. (Tr. 39-40) The two debts are for approximately the same amount and owed to 
the same creditor. Applicant said the creditor verified to him that they were the same 
account. I conclude they are one and the same debt, and it is paid. 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant’s colleague in a graduate department and a teaching colleague and 
professional writing tutor describe him as cheerful, positive, patient, organized, 
determined, goal oriented, dedicated, and responsible. (AE B, C) His brother describes 
him as dedicated, energetic, positive, generous, and conscientious. (AE F) His fiancé 
and two friends said he is dedicated, responsible, energetic, generous, and trustworthy. 
(AE A, D, E) His six character references support his access to sensitive information 
and assignment to a public trust position. (AE A-F)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
      
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance [or 
trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 
484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” 
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit report, SOR response, and hearing transcript. His SOR alleges seven delinquent 
collection debts for $17,093. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
  AG ¶¶ 20(d) is partially applicable, and 20(e) is applicable to the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g duplicates the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. They are approximately 
the same amount and owed to the same creditor. Applicant said the creditor verified to 
him that they were the same account. Applicant provided evidence that he maintained 
contact with his creditors.3   
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence4 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
  Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 
20(a), 20(b), and 20(c). He paid five debts, and he received financial counseling. He 
promised to resolve all of the SOR debts by the end of 2014.  
 
  Applicant’s loss of employment and underemployment are circumstances largely 
beyond his control. He understands what he must do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility.5 The Appeal Board explained that circumstances beyond one’s 
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
4 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
5The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

control can cause unresolved debt, and are not necessarily a bar to having access to 
sensitive and classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions 
to resolve his SOR debts by disputing two debts, and paying five debts. There are clear 
indications the problem is being resolved and is under control. He has made substantial 
progress in the last six months of resolving his delinquent debts. His financial problems 
are unlikely to recur. His history of delinquent debt does not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate 
financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation

duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 25-year-old hospital worker employed by a defense contractor 
since October 2013. He is a high school graduate and was awarded a bachelor of art 
degree in mathematics in 2013. Applicant’s six character statements lauded his cheerful 
positive attitude, patience, organization skills, determination, responsibility, and

reliability. They supported his access to sensitive information and assignment to a 
public trust position. (AE A-F)  There is no evidence of reportable criminal offenses, 
alcohol or drug abuse, or violations of his employment rules. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his public trust responsibilities. There is every indication 
that he is loyal to the United States, the DOD, and his employer.   
 
Applicant’s loss of employment and underemployment caused him to have 
financial problems. These are all circumstances largely beyond his control. 
Nevertheless, he disputed two debts; and he paid five debts. The Appeal Board has 
addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands what he needs to do to 
establish and maintain his financial responsibility. He has made reasonable decisions 
under his particular financial circumstances. His overall financial history shows a 
“meaningful track record” of debt repayment. I am confident he will establish and 
maintain his financial responsibility.6   
                                            
6Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of access to sensitive information now does 
not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to 
reconsider [trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct 
having negative [trustworthiness] significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). 
Violation of a promise made in a [trustworthiness] context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment 
concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation of a public trust position. An 
administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.”

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
