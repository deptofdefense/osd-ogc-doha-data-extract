Decision 
______________ 
 
 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. He has mitigated the criminal conduct and the personal conduct 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 3, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On September 23, 2013, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations

 Item 5 ((SF 86), dated July 3, 2013). 
 
2 
                                      
 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and J (Criminal Conduct), and 
detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a statement notarized 
November 15, 2013,2 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have 
his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He was informed that his 
Answer was incomplete and that it was necessary for him to either admit or deny each 
allegation in each paragraph and subparagraph of the SOR.3 He responded 
appropriately on December 6, 2013.4 A complete copy of the Government’s file of 
relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on March 10, 2014, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  
 
 Imbedded in the FORM as § III, Department Counsel, citing ¶ E.3.1.13., Encl. 3, 
of the Directive,5 amended the SOR by adding additional allegations and security 
concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The amendment consisted of one 
additional paragraph and two subparagraphs. No separate document containing the 
proposed amendment was generated. Although Applicant was furnished instructions 
related to responding to the FORM, there was no separate letter of instruction 
addressing how the amendment was to be handled. Additionally, Applicant was not 
informed that in his Answer to the Amended SOR, it was necessary for him to either 
admit or deny each allegation in each paragraph and subparagraph. Applicant received 
the FORM on March 31, 2014, but as of September 10, 2014, he had not submitted any 
further documents or other information. Applicant did not submit an Answer to the 
Amended SOR. Accordingly, I consider his nonresponse to be a denial. The case was 
assigned to me on September 15, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations and criminal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. through 
1.u., and 2.a. through 2.e.) in the SOR. As noted above, he failed to answer the 
Amended SOR. Applicant’s admissions and other comments are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:

 “As far in advance as practical, Department Counsel and the applicant shall serve one another with a copy 
of any pleading, proposed documentary evidence, or other written communication to be submitted to the 
Administrative Judge.”

Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a welder with his current employer since December 2011.6 He was 
unemployed from September 2011 until December 2011.7 He received a General 
Educational Development (GED) diploma in June 1970. Applicant has never served in 
the U.S. military.8 He was married in February 1985 and separated in April 1985.9 He 
reports no children.  
 
On May 17, 2004, the DOD issued a SOR to him alleging security concerns 
under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct).10 Following a hearing 
before an Administrative Judge with the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA), Applicant’s previous application for a security clearance was denied in 
December 2004.11 The facts and circumstances of the SOR and Decision will be 
discussed further below. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, but a review 
of his September 2013 credit report reveals that judgments were filed against him as far 
back as 2006.12 For some unexplained reason, Applicant failed to maintain his monthly 
payments and accounts became delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection, 
charged off, or went to judgment.  Applicant’s wages were garnished.  
 
The SOR identified 19 delinquent debts, including 3 that went to judgment, as 
generally reflected by his September 2013 credit report.13 Some of the accounts in the 
credit report have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Some of the accounts listed in the SOR do not reflect an account number. 
Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the 
credit report, and other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant regarding 
the same, are described below. 
 
Applicant resolved the following delinquent debts and furnished documentary 
evidence to support his contentions that they had been resolved: SOR ¶ 1.a. ($1,370.13

judgment satisfied July 29, 2011);14 SOR ¶ 1.b. ($955 judgment satisfied by 
garnishment March 7, 2008);15 SOR ¶¶ 1.n. and 1.p. (same debt with two collection 
agents for $88 and $44 paid October 15, 2013);16 SOR ¶ 1.o. ($100 paid August 7, 
2012);17 SOR ¶ 1.r. ($25 paid October 15, 2013);18 SOR ¶ 1.s. ($64 paid October 16, 
2013);19 and SOR ¶¶ 1.t. and 1.u. (two accounts with same creditor for $147 and $276 
satisfied by $117.92 payment October 15, 2013).20 
 
Applicant contended that he entered into repayment arrangements with certain 
creditors for the following delinquent debts but failed to furnish any documentary 
evidence to support his contentions that they are in the process of being resolved: SOR 
¶ 1.c. ($4,003 judgment); SOR ¶ 1.d. ($100); SOR ¶ 1.e. ($1,338); SOR ¶ 1.f. ($354); 
SOR ¶ 1.g. ($268); SOR ¶ 1.h. ($852); SOR ¶ 1.i. ($232); and SOR ¶ 1.k. ($389).21 I 
conclude that these accounts have not been resolved. 
 
There are two remaining delinquent accounts. Applicant said he approached one 
collection agent (SOR ¶ 1.m. for $369), and attempted to return equipment and pay the 
remaining balance, but the collection agent refused to accept the payment.22 Once 
again, he failed to furnish any documentary evidence to support his story. As to the 
other account (SOR ¶ 1.q. for $90), Applicant indicated he was under the impression 
that his insurance had covered the charges, but he failed to say what he planned to do 
about the unpaid balance.23 Neither of these accounts has been resolved. 
 
There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling. Since 
Applicant never described his current finances, it is not known if he has any other 
delinquent debts or if his financial problems are under control. 
 
Criminal Conduct 
 
Applicant also has a lengthy history of criminal conduct, commencing in 
September 1974. (SOR ¶ 2.a.): That month, when he was 20 years old, Applicant was

arrested and charged with three counts of housebreaking and grand larceny, a felony, 
and one count of housebreaking, a felony. He was convicted of two counts of 
housebreaking and sentenced to one to three years confinement for each charge under 
the Youthful Offender Act.24 This allegation was also alleged in his 2004 SOR.25 Based 
on the evidence submitted, the Administrative Judge found the allegation against 
Applicant.26 
 
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): In August 1976, Applicant was arrested and charged with three 
counts of housebreaking and grand larceny, a felony. He was subsequently convicted of 
three counts of grand larceny and sentenced to four years confinement for each count, 
to be served consecutively. He was paroled in May 1980.27 This allegation was also 
alleged in his 2004 SOR.28 Based on the evidence submitted, the Administrative Judge 
found the allegation against Applicant.29 
 
(SOR ¶ 2.c.): In September 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with one 
count of assault and battery. The charges were eventually dismissed.30 This allegation 
was not alleged in his 2004 SOR. 
 
(SOR ¶ 2.d.): In August 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with one 
count of stalking. Applicant had furnished the down-payment for a female friend who 
was purchasing a vehicle, and when his friend failed to make any payments, the dealer 
looked to Applicant for them. When he could not find the friend, Applicant placed a note 
under the windshield wiper of her car. He was later told that the police wanted to see 
him, and when he arrived at the police station, he was told his friend had filed a stalking 
complaint against him.31 The charges were eventually dismissed.32 This allegation was 
also alleged in his 2004 SOR.33 Based on the evidence submitted, the Administrative 
Judge found the allegation in favor of Applicant.34

(SOR ¶ 2.e.): In 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and 
battery – family member and violation of a protective order, misdemeanors.35 He was 
attempting to evict a long-time girlfriend from his home, so she called the police and 
claimed Applicant had hit her, an action he denied.36 A 24-hour protective order was 
filed; another follow-up order was also filed. When Applicant returned to his residence, 
the police were waiting for him and arrested him for violation of the protective order.37 
Applicant was required to complete an anger management program and placed on 
probation for two years. The disposition was nolle prossed until March 2001, at which 
time Applicant completed his program. The probation was terminated and the charges 
were dismissed.38 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 On July 3, 2013, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain 
questions pertaining to his employment activities. The questions in Section 12A – 
Employment Activities asked the general question of the reason for leaving an 
employment activity, and associated with that question, if, in the last seven years, he 
had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement 
following charges or allegations of misconduct, or left by mutual agreement following 
notice of unsatisfactory performance. Applicant answered “no” to all of those 
questions.39 He certified that the responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the 
best of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those questions were, in fact, 
false. On July 31, 2013, less than 30 days after he had completed the SF 86, Applicant 
informed the investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that in 
September 2011, he was fired by his employer for what appeared to be an incident of 
unsatisfactory performance, and described the omission as “oversight.”40 There is no 
evidence that the investigator had confronted Applicant with the true facts.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”41 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.44  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”45

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”46 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances which 
generally predate his 2006 judgment. He apparently found himself with insufficient funds 
to continue making his routine monthly payments and various accounts became 
delinquent, and were placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) have been established. 
 
   The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
46

that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.47  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(d) minimally applies. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
since before 2006 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Although he claimed to have insufficient funds to continue making his 
payments, Applicant never offered any evidence that his financial condition was caused 
by any factors beyond his control. While there are a number of relatively moderate 
medical accounts over the years, there is no evidence that they were caused by 
unexpected medical emergencies. Applicant was separated in 1985, only a few months 
after his marriage, and there is no evidence that his separation contributed to his 
financial difficulties two decades later. He was unemployed from September 2011 until 
December 2011, but that situation took place substantially after his 2006 and 2007 
judgments. There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling. 
Because he never described his current finances, it is not known if he has any other 
delinquent debts or if his financial problems are under control. 
 
One of Applicant’s judgments was resolved by garnishment in 2008. One 
account was satisfied in 2011, and another was resolved in 2012. Several relatively 
small accounts were resolved in 2013. With the exception of two accounts, Applicant 
contends he has entered into repayment arrangements with his other creditors, but as 
noted above, he did not furnish any documentary evidence to support his contentions 
that they are in the process of being resolved. As noted by the Appeal Board, promises 
to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying 
debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.48 
Applicant has not acted responsibly in failing to address the majority of his 
delinquent accounts and by making little, if any, proven efforts of working with his 
                                                          
47
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

creditors.49 Despite his assertions that he has established repayment arrangements with 
many creditors, he failed to furnish any documentary evidence to support those 
contentions. Thus, there is little, if any, evidence that he is in the process of resolving 
those accounts. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances presented cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.50 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses is potentially disqualifying. 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 31(c), if there is an allegation of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, security 
concerns may be raised. In addition, under AG ¶ 31(f), a security concern may be 
raised when there is a conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of 
a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as 
a result of that sentence for not less than a year. Applicant’s history of criminal conduct 
consists of five alleged incidents involving criminal charges, arrests, or convictions for a 
variety of actions. AG ¶¶ 31(a), 31(c), and 31(f), have been established.  
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
Also, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply when there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; 
including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, 
remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement.  
 
AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) apply. The 1974 and 1976 criminal incidents and resulting 
convictions, sentences, and periods of incarceration, are approximately four decades 
old. The charges from 1991 and 2001 were both eventually dismissed. Also,

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

significantly, the 2001 incident was presented to the Administrative Judge in 2004, and 
after considering the available evidence in a DOHA proceeding identical to this one, that 
Administrative Judge determined the allegation in favor of Applicant. There have been 
no further alleged criminal activities since 2010. A person should not be held forever 
accountable for misconduct from the distant past. So much time has elapsed since the 
most recent of Applicant’s criminal incidents occurred, or they happened under such 
unusual circumstances, I conclude that Applicant’s criminal conduct is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), security concerns may be raised when there is a: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
Applicant’s responses to the SF 86 inquiries were false and concealed the fact 
that he had been fired by his employer in September 2011 for what appeared to be an 
incident of unsatisfactory performance. Applicant’s responses provide sufficient 
evidence to examine if his submission was a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the 
Amended SOR, or merely the result of a simple oversight as Applicant had claimed. 
Applicant did not submit an Answer to the Amended SOR, and I consider his 
nonresponse to be a denial of the allegations. As noted above, in the decision-making 
process, facts must be established by “substantial evidence” which a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the 
record, and which is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance. Considering 
the allegation, which is unsupported by evidence of Applicant’s intent to falsify, and 
Applicant’s imputed denial of such intent, as well as his expressed explanation that the 
omission was due to an oversight, I conclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence 
of a deliberate omission, and that AG ¶ 16(a) has been established. 
 
The guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if the individual made 
 
12 
                                      
 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts. The sole evidence of Applicant’s being fired by his 
employer appears in the report of his Personal Subject Interview. The interview was 
conducted less than 30 days after Applicant had completed the SF 86. The admission 
appears as the third item discussed by Applicant, and there is no indication that the 
investigator had previously known about, or confronted Applicant with, the facts about 
the firing. Thus, I conclude that Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted by the investigator with 
the facts. AG 17(a) applies. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.51    
    
 The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:52 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
                                                          
51
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. While 
Applicant’s criminal history included two serious incidents from 1974 and 1976, as well 
as some lesser incidents in 1991 (dismissed), 2001 (dismissed), and 2010, he has 
essentially been a good citizen throughout extensive periods of his life. He was 
generally a hard worker, with the exception of one incident of unsatisfactory 
performance in September 2011. He has been with his current employer since 
December 2011. He paid some of his delinquent accounts.  
 
 The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances since before 2006. He had 
insufficient funds to continue making his routine monthly payments and various 
accounts became delinquent, and were placed for collection, charged off, or went to 
judgment. Applicant never offered any evidence that his financial condition was caused 
by any factors beyond his control. Despite his assertions that he has established 
repayment arrangements with many creditors, he failed to furnish any documentary 
evidence to support those contentions. While Applicant may have satisfied some 
delinquent debts as recently as 2013, his overall track record is not very good. 
Applicant’s handling of his financial issues raises questions about his reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
