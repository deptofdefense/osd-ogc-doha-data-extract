GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility to occupy an automated data processing (ADP) I/II/III (public trust position) is 
granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 25, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On April 24, 2014, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the

Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position to support a 
contract with the DOD, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 21, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated June 
9, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on August 20, 2014. The case was assigned to me on August 21, 2014. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on August 27, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on September 16, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and 14 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE N) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 30, 2014. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. 
He submitted an additional document which was marked as exhibit AE I and admitted 
into evidence without objection. The record closed on September 23, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.). Applicant’s answers and 
explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain his eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position to support a contract with the 
DOD. Applicant received an associate’s degree in 1984, a bachelor’s degree in 1986, 
and a master’s degree in 1992.2 He has never served with the U.S. military.3 Applicant 
was employed as a software quality assurance engineer by a major U.S. company from 
August 1992 until July 2013, when a large lay-off occurred.4 He received a severance 
package. Applicant was unable to obtain another full-time position and remained 
unemployed until October 2013, when he joined his current employer as a senior 
enterprise infrastructure engineer.5 Applicant has also been employed by a department 
store as a customer service representative on a part-time basis during evenings and

Financial Considerations 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2013. In 2010, Applicant purchased a new residence financed, in part, by an early 
distribution of $85,000 from his 401(k) retirement plan.9 He had previously reviewed the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website and determined he was eligible for the 
distribution since it was to be used to purchase his principal residence. What he failed to 
realize or understand was that the eligibility only applied if the residence was an initial 
residential purchase. This purchase was actually Applicant’s second residential 
purchase.10 When he completed his income tax return for 2010, he indicated on his 
Form 1040 that the distribution was non-taxable.11 He was wrong. He was audited in 
December 2012.12 In 2013, Applicant first learned of his error and learned he owed the 
IRS between $30,000 and 35,000.13 It was agreed that he would repay the unpaid tax, 
the ten percent penalty, and interest in August 2013 when he would take out a loan from 
his 401(k). Unfortunately for Applicant, in July 2013 he was laid off and no longer had 
access to the proposed loan-source.14  
Applicant commenced negotiations with the IRS to reduce or cancel the penalties 
and interest owed, but his application was denied.15 An Installment Agreement for the 
amount owed ($45,676.64) was reached in April 2014, and Applicant agreed to make 
automatic monthly payments of $610 to the IRS starting in May 2014.16 The balance 
owed was reduced to $42,489.21, when his $3,957 overpayment of his 2013 income 
taxes was applied.17 He has continued making his monthly payments to the IRS and

believes his current balance is about $40,000.18 It is Applicant’s intention to continue 
making the automatic monthly payments, and he anticipates increasing the amount of 
those monthly payments to about $810.19 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): As a direct result of his early distribution of those 401(k) assets and 
his erroneous entry on his Form 1040, the information was forwarded to the state 
department of revenue and in October 2013, it notified him of his newly calculated state 
income tax deficiency ($8,889.40).20 Not wishing to enter into a simultaneous federal 
and a state tax dispute, Applicant promptly agreed to the state’s proposed installment 
agreement.21 Commencing in February 2014, two months before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant started making his monthly payments of $736.22 By August 4, 2014, he had 
overpaid the state, and was due a refund of $376.14.23 The account has been resolved. 
During the hearing, Applicant indicated he had about $3,000 in his checking 
account, about $100 in his savings account, a 401(k) valued at $300,000, a mutual fund 
worth about $85,000, a $500,000 residence (with a mortgage), and a rented rental 
property of unspecified value.24 He guesstimated that he had approximately $300 
available for discretionary spending or savings each month.25 He subsequently 
furnished a monthly budget which reveals a monthly income of $8,308.44, estimated 
expenses of $7,732.59, and $575.85 available for discretionary spending or savings 
each month.26 Applicant is current on all other accounts.27 He has filed all of his annual 
federal and state income taxes in a timely manner.28 Applicant is active in his 
community and serves as a volunteer at his church and at the restaurant that his church 
owns.29

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”30 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”31 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”32 DOD contractor personnel are 
afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made.33  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, “should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”36 
 
Public trust eligibility decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall 
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37 Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
public trust eligibility determination.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the 
record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In 2010, Applicant purchased a new residence financed, in part, by 
an early distribution of $85,000 from his 401(k) retirement plan. When he completed his 
income tax return for 2010, he erroneously indicated on his Form 1040 that the 
distribution was non-taxable. He was wrong. He subsequently learned he owed the IRS 
between $30,000 and 35,000, and he owed the state an additional sum. AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.38  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s misunderstanding of the 
federal tax provisions pertaining to early distributions from retirement accounts for the 
purpose of purchasing a primary residence was the sole cause of his financial difficulty 
with the IRS. Once the error was uncovered, he had already been laid off and was 
unable to resolve the error in a more timely fashion because he no longer had loan-
access to his retirement account and he had no salary for several months to address 
the issue. Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were 
in some measure beyond Applicant’s control. He acted responsibly and in good faith 
under the circumstances by enrolling in installment agreements with both the IRS and 
                                                          
38
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

the state department of revenue. The state income tax balance has been paid off. In 
fact, he paid too much and was expected to receive a refund. The IRS balance has 
been steadily diminished by his monthly payments. All of Applicant’s newer accounts 
are current. A review of his monthly budget reveals that he now has approximately 
$575.85 each month available for discretionary spending or savings. Applicant acted 
responsibly by addressing both of his delinquent accounts, and working with his 
creditors.39 With his current job, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting 
him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.40 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance or suitability for a public trust position by 
considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The 
administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance or suitability for a public trust position must be an overall commonsense 
judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person 
concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the 
totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.41       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His misreading 
and misunderstanding of the federal tax provisions resulted in his claiming no tax liability 
for his early distribution of $85,000 from his 401(k), and the resulting federal and state 
income tax delinquencies of substantial amounts.  
                                                          
39
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
9 
                                      
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were primarily due to his 
misunderstanding and misreading of federal tax provisions pertaining to early 
distributions from retirement accounts for the purpose of purchasing a primary 
residence. His inability to resolve both his federal and state income tax delinquencies 
was to some degree beyond Applicant’s control when he was laid off and unemployed, 
and later denied loan-access to his retirement account. Applicant did not ignore his two 
debts. Instead, he set up installment agreements. Applicant has already resolved his 
state tax issue and is in the process of resolving his federal tax issue. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:42 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is

is granted.
