RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, financial considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 8, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 On June 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2014. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
 
2 
 
 
September 10, 2014. I convened the hearing as scheduled, by video teleconference, on 
October 1, 2014.  
 
The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A 
through K, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held 
open until October 10, 2014, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional 
documents. She submitted AE L through O, which were admitted without objection.1 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 9, 2014.  
 
Procedural issues 
 
 Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.k, 1.n, 1.q, and 1.u as 
duplicate allegations. Applicant did not object, and the motion was granted.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, 
1.v-1.z, and 1.aa-1.ee of the SOR and denied the remaining allegations. Her 
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review 
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 47 years old. She is a high school graduate. She has worked for her 
current employer or its subcontractor since April 2013. She was married from 1986 to 
1997 and from 2003 to 2009, but was separated from her husband in 2007. She 
remarried in 2009. She became the guardian of her two nieces in 2004. She did not 
receive any child support from either of the parents. She did receive a year of 
government assistance for the children. The children are now ages 22 and 20.3  
 
During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Applicant’s home was damaged, and she lost 
her personal property. She received compensation from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and started over. In 2007, she separated from her husband and 
their divorce was finalized in 2009. As part of the property settlement, after the 
refinancing of their house, she received $10,000 over a period of about six months.4  
 
From 2007 to 2009, Applicant experienced some health problems. In 2007, 2009, 
and 2013 her husband had heart attacks, along with other medical issues. In 2011, 
Applicant experienced more medical problems. Although her husband was eligible to 
obtain medical insurance through his employer, they felt it was cost prohibitive, and they

did not have medical insurance. She was self-employed from May 2011 until she began 
work with her current employer in April 2013. She worked from April 2011 to November 
2011 as a home care provider. From September 2010 to May 2011, she worked for a 
communications company. She was unemployed from May 2010 to September 2010. 
From July 2005 to May 2010, Applicant was a regional manager for a 
telecommunications company and chose to leave to stay home with her family.5  
 
In 2011, Applicant and her husband moved in with his parents. Her husband 
continued to have medical problems in 2012. During the same year, they borrowed 
money from Applicant’s father-in-law to pay some bills. Her father-in-law obtained a 
$10,000 loan from his credit union that was given to Applicant and her husband to make 
payments on a truck loan. The balance on the loan is $3,765. He also authorized them 
to use his credit card that had a $10,000 limit. The balance owed on the credit card is 
$6,137. Applicant and her husband have been making monthly payments of $500 to 
repay him for the two debts.6  
 
The SOR alleges medical debts in ¶¶ 1.e ($12,906), 1.f ($2,648), 1.h ($1,171), 1.i 
($976), 1.j ($931), 1.l ($699), 1.m ($600), 1.o ($510), 1.p ($495), 1.r ($432), 1.s ($388), 
1.t ($365), 1.v ($334), 1.w ($335), 1.x ($200), 1.y ($151), 1.z ($111), 1.aa ($96), 1.bb 
($80), 1.dd ($58), and 1.ee ($32), totaling approximately $23,518. Applicant does not 
dispute she owes the alleged debts. She would like to pay them, but is unable. During 
Applicant’s background investigation she stated that she intended on contacting certain 
creditors and establishing payment plans with them. She also indicated that she 
intended to make payments to other creditors. She intended to make credit inquiries 
about the validity of some of the alleged debts, and if the debts were valid she intended 
to pay them. At her hearing, Applicant stated that she contacted the credit bureau about 
some debts, but did not contact any of the creditors. She confirmed she did not follow 
up on what she said she intended to do about the delinquent debts. Applicant stated 
that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.aa is paid. She believed some of the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.bb 
through 1.ee were paid, but did not identify specifically which ones. She did not provide 
proof of payment for any of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.aa through 1.ee.7  
 
Applicant provided proof that the tax lien debt in SOR ¶ 1.a belonged to her ex-
husband, and it was satisfied.8 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($557) was a joint checking 
account Applicant held with her ex-husband that was charged off in approximately 2006 
or 2007. The amount delinquent was for an overdraft. She understood from her ex-
husband that it was paid. She did not provide any documents to support the status of 
the debt. Applicant is unaware what the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($361) is for. She has not 
researched its origin. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($252) is an unpaid utility bill. Applicant

explained she moved and did not receive the final bill. It remains unpaid. The debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.cc ($67) is for a company telephone bill from when she was employed with the 
company in 2011. She indicated in her background investigation statement that she 
intended to pay this debt. It remains unpaid.9  
 
Applicant stated she and her husband contacted the creditor of the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.m, and they made a $50 payment toward the debt. They intend to make monthly 
payments of $50. The debt has been owed since 2008. She explained some of the 
medical debts have been consolidated and this payment is for the aggregate amount. 
She believed SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i pertain to the creditor they made the $50 payment 
to. She did not provide proof of the payment or any additional payments. She provided 
documents to show she is making a payment to a collection agency on a debt that is not 
alleged in the SOR. She believed that the debt was originally $1,100, and she started 
making payments in June 2014 and has paid $600.10 She also provided documents to 
show she paid some small debts that became delinquent in 2013 and were paid in 
August 2014.11 These debts were also not alleged in the SOR.12 
 
Applicant provided copies of her husband’s pay stub to show a payment of $470 
is being deducted from his pay each month. She indicated that this payment is being 
applied to an outstanding medical bill. It is unclear if it is part of any of the medical bills 
alleged in the SOR. In addition, there is another deduction each month to repay a 
student loan. Their Federal income tax refund is also applied to the balance.13 
 
Applicant stated that she earned approximately $25,000 in annual income in 
2010 to 2011. She quit the job due to medical reasons. She earned approximately 
$15,000 from April 2013 to April 2014. Her current annual salary is projected to be 
approximately $20,000. Her husband earned approximately $44,000 in gross pay since 
2009, except when he was unemployed from 2010 to 2012. Applicant works about four 
to five hours of overtime each week.14  
 
Applicant and her husband have health care savings accounts that they 
contribute $10 a month to, and it is matched by their employer. Their employers also

mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful 
rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006) (citations omitted). I have considered the debts that were not alleged in the SOR for these limited 
purposes.

provide them $250 each to spend on medical care. They both contribute 3% of their 
salary to a 401K retirement account. Applicant estimated their household has 
approximately $327 remaining in expendable income each month after they pay their 
expenses and make the $500 payment to her father-in-law. She has one credit card 
with a $300 balance. She has been paying her car loan on time. She and her husband 
have negligible money in a savings account. They do not provide support to any family 
members. Applicant stated that she will pay what she is able to pay on her delinquent 
debts. She stated that for the last year and a half she is trying to live within her means. 
She indicated that she has a good-faith intention to pay her bills. Applicant purchased a 
2012 Camaro in May 2014 for $18,000.15  
 
Applicant’s supervisor testified on her behalf. She is rated as “exceeds 
expectations,” which is the top grade. This is based on an employee’s attendance, 
ethics, work performance, and productivity. She described Applicant as a great asset to 
the team, who does her work timely and in an ethical manner. Applicant’s work is 
considered outstanding.16  
 
Applicant also provided a character letter. In it she is described as reliable and 
trustworthy. She is a person who has integrity and is responsible. She is dedicated to 
her family and work.17 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this

decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following two are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
7 
 
 
Applicant has numerous delinquent debts totaling more than $23,000 that are 
unpaid. Applicant is unable or unwilling to satisfy her debts. She began accumulating 
delinquent debt in 2007. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is satisfied. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b Applicant attributes to 
a joint account she held with her ex-husband. The debt is not resolved. Applicant has 
not resolved the remaining delinquent debts, and they remain owed. Due to her fragile 
financial situation, I cannot conclude that her financial problems are unlikely to recur 
and do not cast doubt on her current reliability. AG ¶ 20(a) is not established.  
 
Applicant and her husband had serious medical issues and most, but not all, of 
their delinquent debts are for medical accounts. They chose not to have medical 
insurance because it was too expensive. She was unemployed or underemployed for a 
period of time. Applicant was caring for her two nieces and did not receive child support. 
She received government assistance for about a year. In 2005, her home was damaged 
and she lost her personal items due to Hurricane Katrina. These conditions negatively 
impacted her finances and were beyond her control. In order to fully apply AG ¶ 20(b), 
Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. She received a 
$10,000 property settlement from her ex-husband in 2009. She and her husband are 
 
8 
 
 
repaying her father-in-law for a loan and a credit card debt with a combined balance of 
approximately $9,900. Applicant stated she intends to pay her debts, but she does not 
have the resources to do so. It is undisputed that she has had traumatic events affect 
her finances over the past ten years. Although Applicant appears to be unable to pay 
her delinquent debts, she has not made an effort to verify debts she questioned or work 
out any type of payment plan even with creditors of small debts. She recently purchased 
an new car for $18,000. I find AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies.  
 
Of the 30 delinquent debts 26 are for medical accounts. Despite her statement 
that she intended to pay some of the small debts, she was either unable or unwilling to 
do so. She has not contacted the creditors to discuss a payment plan. Regarding debts 
she had questions about, she did not follow through to confirm the validity of the debts. 
She stated she made a payment to one creditor and another debt was resolved, but she 
did not provide proof of the payment. She and her husband are repaying his father for a 
loan and a credit card they used. She stated that she is making payments on another 
delinquent debt that was not alleged. She testified she also made payments on more 
recent delinquent debts. There was no evidence presented that Applicant has had 
financial counseling. Applicant stated she intends to pay her creditors what she can. 
The evidence does not support that she has the resources to resolve her delinquent 
debts. She does not have a viable plan for how she will resolve her delinquent debts. 
Despite her best intentions, she has not established any type of repayment track record. 
She has no savings and has $327 remaining each month. There are not clear 
indications her financial problems are under control at this time or that she has made a 
good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve her delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 
20(d) do not apply. 
 
Applicant failed to provide a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
debts she disputes. She did not provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
her dispute or provide evidence of actions she has taken to resolve the issue. AG ¶ 
20(e) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
9 
 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a valued team member to her employer. She began experiencing 
financial problems in 2009 when she and her husband had medical problems and no 
health insurance. They also experienced periods of unemployment. Her financial 
problems were beyond her control, but despite her good intentions, Applicant is unable 
at this time to pay delinquent debts. Her finances remain fragile. Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability 
for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings

Conclusion

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
