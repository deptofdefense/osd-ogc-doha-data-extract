HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges ten delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts totaling $53,818. He paid two debts, and three large debts are in 
established payment plans. He disputed his responsibility for several debts, and they 
are not listed on his April 2014 credit report. He provided sufficient documentation of his 
progress in resolving his financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 17, 2011, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions version of a security clearance application (SF 86). (Item 3) On March 12, 
2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On April 16, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated August 7, 2014, was provided to him on August 18, 2014.1 Applicant responded 
to the FORM and provided additional mitigating evidence. Department Counsel did not 
object to my consideration of the additional evidence. The case was assigned to me on 
October 1, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g. (Item 2) He indicated the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c were in 
established payment plans and the debts in 1.f and 1.g were paid. (Item 2) He denied 
responsibility for the remaining SOR debts. (Item 2) His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old electrical equipment repairman, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since September 2011.3 He graduated from high school in 1985, and 
he has completed about some college credits with a focus on electrical engineering. 
From September 1985 to June 1988, he served on active duty in the Army, and he 
received an honorable discharge. 
 
From January 2010 to July 2011, he worked as an aircraft electrician; from June 
2009 to January 2010, he was unemployed; from April 2008 to June 2009, he worked 
as an electrician and assistant production line supervisor at a naval base; and from 
March 2007 to April 2008, he worked as an electrician. From November 2004 to April 
2008, he worked as a loan officer for several companies.     
 
From 2002 to 2008, Applicant worked part time as a personal trainer and 
provided electrical work. In 2003, he was divorced, and there were two children from 
this marriage. 
   
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated August 8, 2014, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 18, 2014. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he 
had 30 days after his receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, the sources for the information in this paragraph and the next 
paragraph are his July 17, 2011 SF 86, his September 3, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
personal subject interview (PSI), and his July 18, 2011 Declaration for Federal Employment and resume.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his July 17, 2011 SF 86, 
his September 3, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject 
interview (PSI), his July 18, 2011 Declaration for Federal Employment, and his 2013 
credit report. (Items 3-7) His SOR alleges ten delinquent, collection, or charged-off 
accounts totaling $53,818. 
 
Applicant explained in his September 3, 2011 OPM PSI that he did not file his 
federal and state tax returns from 2002 to 2006, resulting in tax debts totaling $51,634. 
(Items 1, 5) From 2002 to 2006, he suffered from a mental illness; he indicated his 
mental illness caused his financial problems; and he received treatment for his mental 
illness. (Item 5) In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) obtained a lien against him 
for $47,938. (Item 2) He established a payment plan that is satisfactory to the IRS, and 
he provided proof that he has made $200 monthly payments since July 2011 to the IRS.  
(Item 2) From July 2012 to present, he made $200 monthly payments to address his 
two delinquent state tax debts. (Item 2) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c are in 
established payment plans. 
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($277) and 1.g ($195) pertain to two 
telecommunications accounts. (Item 1) Applicant said he paid these two debts on 
January 23, 2014, and he provided an account statement showing a payment of $355. 
(FORM response) 
 
Applicant consistently denied knowledge of and responsibility for the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($910, a medical account), 1.e ($513, a city collection account), and 1.f 
($97, a collection account). (Item 1) Those accounts are not listed on Applicant’s April 
2014 and August 2014 credit reports as delinquent accounts. (SOR response; Item 8) 
 
Applicant said he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($120) and 1.j ($72), which were 
owed to a municipality. (Item 1) He provided a February 8, 2010 receipt for $170. 
(FORM response) His credit report shows “Paid or paying as agreed” for this creditor. 
(Item 2) 
 
Applicant fell behind on his student loans, child support, and credit cards. See 
note 3, supra. Applicant’s April 2014 credit report shows student loans, child support, 
installment, and credit card accounts in current status or paid as agreed. The only 
derogatory notations on his August 2014 credit report are two tax liens; however, these 
entries lack any indication of current status. (Item 8) There is no evidence of credit 
counseling.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his July 17, 2011 SF 86, his 
September 3, 2011 OPM PSI, and his July 18, 2011 Declaration for Federal 
Employment. His SOR alleges ten delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts 
totaling $53,818.  During his OPM PSI, he disclosed that he did not file his federal and 
state tax returns from 2002 to 2006, resulting in tax debts totaling $51,634. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
to 20(c). His financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond his 
control. Applicant had mental problems, and he did not file his income tax returns for 
several years. Once he received treatment, he was able to establish payment plans with 
the IRS and state tax authority. He brought his student loans, child support, and credit 
cards to current status.5  
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence6 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
  Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board considered a case where an applicant, who had been sporadically unemployed 
                                                                                                                                            
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
5 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
6Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and lacked the ability to pay her creditors, and noted that “it will be a long time at best 
before she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment 
compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a 
circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information 
stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” He had mental health problems and made some bad choices about his 
taxes and other debts. After receiving treatment, he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances by maintaining contact with his creditors,7 making payments, and 
bringing his debts to current status. Although he did not receive financial counseling, 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Although Applicant disputed his responsibility for 
several relatively minor debts on the SOR, he did not provide documentation showing 
what he did to document those disputes. His April 2014 and August 2014 credit reports 
did not include the debts he disputed.      
 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts primarily because of mental health 
issues. He received treatment and has made substantial progress rehabilitating his 
finances. He has done all that is reasonably possible for him to do to establish his 
financial responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old electrical equipment repairman, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since September 2011. He graduated from high school in 1985, and 
he has completed about some college credits with a focus in electrical engineering. 
From September 1985 to June 1988, he served on active duty in the Army, and he 
received an honorable discharge. From April 2008 to present, he has worked for 
multiple employers as an electrician or assistant line supervisor. From November 2004 
to April 2008, he worked as a loan officer for several companies. In 2003, he was 
divorced, and he has two children from this marriage. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves some credit for 
volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor and for his 
Army service. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer. His mental health problems caused his financial woes. I give Applicant 
substantial credit for maintaining contact with his creditors, establishing payment plans, 
and either paying or bringing all of his delinquent debts to current status.     
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he will continue to pay his debts and 
maintain his financial responsibility.8    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
                                            
8Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative 
security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise 
made in a security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and 
may support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this Applicant’s security clearance is 
conditional.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
