Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. The security concerns stemming from his
marijuana use and his misrepresentations about his illegal drug involvement are
sufficiently mitigated. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted an application for a security clearance on
November 27, 2013.  After reviewing the application and information gathered during a1
background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD), on May 1, 2014, sent
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,2
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action2
under the security guidelines known as Guideline E for personal conduct and Guideline
H for drug involvement. Applicant answered the SOR on May 19, 2014. Neither
Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be
decided on the written record.3
On August 20, 2014, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material
information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant material4
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it September 3, 2014. Applicant’s timely
reply to the FORM consists of a one-page letter, which is admitted as Exhibit A. The
case was assigned to me October 20, 2014.   
Findings of Fact
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in the findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security
clearance. He has been employed as a physicist 1 with the same company since 1983.
His first marriage ended in divorce and he remarried in 2008. He has two children from
his first marriage, both of whom are now adults. 
The DOD granted Applicant a secret-level security clearance in 1984.  He held a5
clearance until about 2007, when his eligibility was revoked due to his untruthfulness
about his past use of marijuana.  He applied for a security clearance in 2013 at the6
request of his employer, after deciding “it was worth” going through the security
clearance process because he believes he “can make a difference in helping and
supporting our war fighters.”7

In his November 2013 security clearance application,  Applicant disclosed the8
following information about his illegal drug involvement:
• That he was charged in February 2005 with the offenses of open container of
alcohol in a vehicle and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The possession
charge was dropped or dismissed and he paid a fine for the open container
charge.
• That he used marijuana a few times annually, which he described as recreational
use of marijuana, from about January 1984 to February 2006, a period of more
than 20 years, while possessing a security clearance.
• That his security clearance was revoked in 2007 because he had been untruthful
about his past marijuana use. 
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he falsified a February 2000
security clearance application  when he answered in the negative to a question asking9
about using illegal drugs within the last seven years. Second, he admitted that he
falsified an October 2005 security clearance application  when he answered a question10
about his police record by disclosing the February 2005 open container offense but
omitting the marijuana offense. Third, he admitted that he falsified the same October
2005 security clearance application when he answered in the negative to a question
asking about using illegal drugs within the last seven years. And fourth, he admitted
using marijuana with varying frequency during 1984–2006 while in possession of a
security clearance. In addition to his admissions, he expressed remorse, he offered no
excuses, and he accepted responsibility for his actions. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

4
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
1. The drug involvement allegation
Applicant’s history of illegal drug involvement (consisting of use and possession
of marijuana) is disqualifying under the drug involvement guideline.  The evidence22
shows he engaged in drug abuse by using marijuana for more than 20 years during
1984–2006. Moreover, he used marijuana after being granted a security clearance,
which is a breach of trust.  His drug abuse reflects negatively on his judgment,23
reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations.   
There are four mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline H.  First, the24
mitigating condition in AG ¶ 26(a) applies because Applicant’s marijuana use happened
so long ago—he last used marijuana more than eight years ago in early 2006—that it
does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.
Second, the mitigating condition in AG ¶ 26(b) applies because Applicant has
demonstrated an intention not to engage in drug abuse in the future as shown by the
eight-year period of abstinence from marijuana use. The other two mitigating conditions
are inapplicable to the facts of this case. In addition, Applicant receives credit for
disclosing his illegal drug involvement in his 2013 security clearance application and
during the security clearance process. By doing so, he did what is expected of a person
seeking access to classified information. 
2. The personal conduct allegations
Applicant’s falsifications of the February 2000 and October 2005 security
clearance applications and the marijuana use while in possession of a security
clearance are disqualifying under the personal conduct guideline.  With that said, the25
negative security implications of engaging in drug abuse while in possession of a
security clearance are discussed above under Guideline H and will not be repeated
here. The falsifications of two security clearance applications, however, are significant.
He gave false answers to multiple questions in an effort to conceal his illegal drug
involvement, which is serious misconduct that is not easily explained away, excused, or
mitigated.
There are seven mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline E.  First, the26
mitigating condition in AG ¶ 17(c) applies because the multiple falsifications occurred
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).27
6
when he completed the security clearance applications in 2000 and 2005, which is 14
and 9 years ago, respectively. Given the passage of time, coupled with Applicant’s full
disclosure in his 2013 security clearance application, the multiple falsifications do not
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Second, the
mitigating condition in AG ¶ 17(e) applies because, by fully disclosing his history of
illegal drug involvement in his 2013 security clearance application, he took substantial,
positive steps to reduce if not eliminate any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or
duress. The remaining mitigating conditions are inapplicable to the facts of this case.   
Taken together, Applicant’s history of illegal drug involvement and personal
conduct do not justify current doubt about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and
ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the
whole-person concept.  I also weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the27
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. Accordingly, I
conclude he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.   
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline E: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.d: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline H: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.a: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
