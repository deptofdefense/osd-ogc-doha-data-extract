DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 1, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F. DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. On May 24, 2014, Applicant answered 
 
2 
 
 
the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was assigned to me on July 18, 2014. On 
July 22, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of 
Hearing scheduling the hearing for August 14, 2014. The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
4, while Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A though F. The record of 
the proceeding was left open until August 28, 2014, to provide Applicant an opportunity 
to present additional matters. He submitted additional documents that were marked as 
AE G through I. All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The 
prehearing guidance sent to Applicant was entered into the record as Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 1, Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was entered as HE 2, and a post-hearing 
email sent to Applicant as HE 3. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on 
August 25, 2014. 
 
Procedural Matter 
 
 Department Counsel made a motion to amend the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d by 
changing the amount of the past-due debt from $511 to $20,140 to conform to the 
evidence. Applicant objected to the amendment. His objection was overruled, and the 
motion to amend the SOR was granted. The record of the proceeding was left open as 
noted above for Applicant to submit additional matters concerning the amendment.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old computer network engineer who works for a defense 
contractor. He has been working for his current employer since January 2013. He 
graduated from high school in 1994 and has accumulated enough college credits to be 
considered a senior. He married in June 1999 and divorced in April 2013. He continues 
to live with his ex-wife. They have reconciled and plan to remarry. He has three 
children, ages 11, 14, and 16. This is the first time that Applicant has sought to obtain a 
security clearance.2 
  
The SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling $22,410 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.g). In the Answer to the SOR, he admitted each of the alleged debts.3 
 
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to a variety of problems, including a 
downturn in the economy, periods of unemployment, divorce, health issues, and 
contractor fraud. From 2000 to 2009, he worked as an assembly line worker for a car 
manufacturer. His net annual salary in that job was about $47,000, and he was

financially stable then. Due to a downturn in the economy, the car manufacturer offered 
buy-outs to its employees. Applicant accepted a buy-out of $75,000 before taxes and 
two years of tuition. The buy-out amounted to about $46,000 after taxes. From May 
2009 to August 2010, he was unemployed while attending school for information 
technology and network engineering. His wife was the sole wage earner in the home 
during that period, but they also lived off his buy-out. In August 2010, he obtained a job 
that required him to climb ladders. He had a seizure on that job, which ultimately 
resulted in him resigning because he could no longer climb the ladders. He was then 
unemployed from November 2011 to March 2012. From March to June 2012, Applicant 
was employed at a minimum wage job. He then moved to a higher-paying temporary job 
before starting his current job.4  
 
In the past year, Applicant resolved $7,824 in delinquent debts that are not listed 
on the SOR. These include: 
 
Type  Amount Status 
Judgment $3,444 Judgment filed October 2010; satisfied 
July 2013; GE 2, AE C, F, I. 
Cable bill $1,140 Assigned for collection in November 2011; 
paid November 2013; GE 2, AE A, F.  
Cable bill $179 Assigned for collection in June 2011; paid 
October 2013; GE 2, AE F, I. 
Cellular bill $1,988 Assigned for collection in July 2013; paid 
October 2013 for less than full balance; 
GE 2, AE F, I. 
Medical bill  $488 Assigned for collection in December 2012; 
paid October 2013; GE 2, AE F, I. 
Banking debt $534 Assigned for collection in February 2011; 
paid August 2013 for less than full 
balance; GE 2, AE B, F, I. 
Medical debt $51 Assigned for collection April 2012; paid 
August 2013; GE 2, AE F, I. 
 
 Applicant was a credible witness. He stated that he intends to continue resolving 
all of his negative debts. Each of the alleged debts is addressed separately below: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – medical account for $1,521. In his post-hearing submission, 
Applicant presented a plan for resolving this debt. It indicated that he would make an 
initial payment of $500 in September 2014 and then three monthly payments of $255 
until it is paid off in about December 2014.5

SOR ¶ 1.b – medical account for $60. Applicant indicated that he has attempted 
to pay this debt, but it appears the creditor is no longer in business. He noted the 
telephone number of the creditor reflected in the credit reports and on the internet is no 
longer in service. This is minor debt of negligible security significance.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – charged-off account for $2,636. This was a utility bill for the rental 
property discussed in SOR ¶ 1.e below. Applicant indicated that he has not yet 
addressed this debt because he has been paying other delinquent debts. At the time of 
the hearing, he last talked to the creditor in about June 2014 to discuss potential ways 
of resolving this debt. In his post-hearing submission, he presented a plan in which he 
would make an initial payment of $500 in February 2015 and monthly payments of $267 
until it is paid off in about September 2015.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – past-due account for $20,140. This was a mortgage loan on a rental 
property that Applicant purchased in 2000. While the property was rented, the house 
caught on fire in December of 2008 and was severely damaged. Applicant hired a 
contractor and signed over $45,000 of fire insurance proceeds to the contractor. In 
about August 2009, the contractor disappeared after collecting the insurance payment 
without completing the repairs. Applicant never heard from the contractor again. At that 
time, Applicant was still employed by the car manufacturer and was able to continue 
making the monthly payments on the property. However, with the downturn in the 
economy and leaving his job with the car manufacturer, he eventually was unable to 
keep up with the mortgage payments. Foreclosure proceedings started in about 2010. 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted an IRS Form 1099-A that indicated the 
property was acquired by the creditor on July 2, 2012, the balance of the principal 
outstanding was $42,162, and the fair market value of the property was $54,635. Since 
the fair market value was greater than the amount owed, the creditor recouped what 
was owed. This debt is resolved.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – mortgage account past due for $10,917 in foreclosure, with a 
balance of $101,581. This was a mortgage loan on a rental property purchased in 2003. 
The property was rented until the tenants lost their jobs in 2009. The tenant vacated the 
property and Applicant was not able to keep up with the monthly payments. A credit 
report reflected that the foreclosure process had started on this property. At the hearing, 
Applicant indicated that he did not know the status of this debt. He stated that he called 
the creditor several times and no one seemed to know anything about the debt. He 
noted that the creditor stopped reporting anything about the debt on his credit reports in 
2009. He indicated that employees of the creditor told him to hire an attorney. In his

post-hearing submission, he stated that he would contact an attorney for assistance in 
resolving this debt.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – charged-off account for $2,567. This debt was for a loan on a vehicle 
that was repossessed 2010. He requested a statement of deficiency from the creditor, 
but has not received one. He indicated that the debt has been transferred to another 
creditor and the original creditor would not advise him of the name of the new creditor. 
In his post-hearing submission, he stated that he would contact an attorney for 
assistance in resolving this debt.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – collection account for $4,198. This debt was a student loan that was 
placed for collection in April 2012. Applicant indicated that he intended to pay off this 
debt next because it would enable him to obtain his degree and compete for higher 
paying jobs. He has been making payments on his other student loans that recently 
become due. In his post-hearing submission, he presented a plan to resolve this debt in 
which he would make an initial payment of $1,000 in December 2014 and monthly 
payments of $399 until it is paid off in about July 2015.11 
 
Since obtaining his current job, Applicant has been living within his means and 
has incurred no new delinquent debts. In March 2013, Applicant contacted a debt 
consolidation agency and began making payments to them. However, he discontinued 
making those payments when he realized the agency’s fees amounted to a large 
percentage of his payments. He eventually decided he would resolve the debts himself 
without the agency’s assistance.12 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is about $46,000. In February 2014, he submitted a 
Personal Financial Statement (PFS) that reflected his total net monthly income was 
$2,772 and his total monthly expenses were $1,903, which left him a net monthly 
remainder of $869. Since submitting that document, he received a three percent raise. 
His PFS did not list any monthly debt payments. It also did not list a spouse’s net 
monthly salary because he is still divorced; however, he still lives with his ex-wife and 
shares living expenses with her. His PFS listed that he had $225 in a bank account and 
$769 in a 401(k) account.13 
 
Applicant indicated that his ex-wife has great credit. She owns a house that is 
located in an economically depressed city. They both lived in that house before moving

to their current location to pursue employment opportunities. They have an arrangement 
in which she pays the mortgage on the property and he pays other expenses. A relative 
is living in that property and the monthly payments on it are in good standing.14 
 
Applicant submitted his annual performance review for 2013. He was rated as 
“outstanding” (highest level) in three performance categories, as “exceeds expectations” 
in two categories, and as “meets expectations” in two categories. The performance 
review indicated that he was a valuable employee who is reliable.15 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
                                                          
14 Tr. 71-73, 84-88.  
15 AE G, H.  
 
7 
 
 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
Because Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts that he was 
unwilling to satisfy for an extended period, the following disqualifying conditions under 
AG ¶ 19 are applicable:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
  Four mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
 
8 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection procedures, but 
assessments of reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In such adjudications, 
an applicant is not required to establish that he or she had paid off each and every 
alleged debt. Likewise, there is no requirement that an applicant establish a plan to pay 
all debts simultaneously or that he or she first pays the debts listed in the SOR. All that 
is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his or her circumstances and 
develops a reasonable repayment plan accompanied by actions showing a serious 
intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 
2008) and ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  
 
 In the present case, Applicant experienced periods of unemployment and 
underemployment due to a downturn in the economy and medical problems. During the 
period under review, he also went through a divorce and was defrauded by a contractor. 
These were conditions beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems. 
Since obtaining his current job, Applicant has acted responsibly in resolving seven 
delinquent debts totaling $7,824. For three of the remaining debts, he has proposed 
realistic repayment plans. His resolution of the seven delinquent debts is sufficient to 
establish that he has a serious intent to effectuate the proposed repayment plans.  
 
 The two largest remaining debts involve a foreclosed property and a 
repossessed vehicle. Applicant contacted the creditors of those two large debts in an 
effort to determine the amount owed after the home and vehicle were reacquired by the 
creditors. Despite his requests, the creditors have not informed him of what, if any, 
deficiency remains on those debts. In response to his inquiries, employees of the 
mortgage loan creditor advised him to hire an attorney. Given that one of his foreclosed 
properties resulted in no deficiency, it is not unreasonable for Applicant to insist on the 
creditors adequately establishing the amount of any deficiencies before taking further 
steps to resolve these debts. He indicated that he does intend to hire an attorney to 
assist him in resolving these two debts. 
 
9 
 
 
 Since obtaining his current job, Applicant has incurred no new delinquent debts. 
His financial problems are under control and are being resolved. Additional delinquent 
debts are unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially 
apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a valued employee. He has taken sufficient action to show he is 
serious about resolving his delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me 
with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial 
considerations security concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.g:  For Applicant

Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
