GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 25, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On April 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 8, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated May 
27, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on July 21, 2014. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2014. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on July 25, 2014, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
August 12, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2014. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted six additional documents, which were marked as exhibits AE 
J through AE O and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
August 26, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.f. through 1.l.). He 
denied the two remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e.). Applicant’s answers and 
explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for which, since 
October 2011, he has served as a software engineer.2 Applicant graduated from high 
school in 2001.3 He periodically attended two different universities, and in 2012, he was 
awarded a bachelor’s degree in computer information systems.4 He plans on enrolling in 
a master’s degree program.5 Applicant was married in January 2008.6 He and his wife 
have a son born in 2008 and a daughter born in 2010. He also has one stepson born in 
2006.7 Applicant has never served with the U.S. military.8 He has held a secret security 
clearance since October 2006.9

Financial Considerations 
Because of his highly specialized experience and expertise, Applicant generally 
works on government contracts that routinely expire, causing him to periodically move 
around in his search for new employment.10 There was nothing unusual about 
Applicant’s finances until about 2008, when he claimed he initially started experiencing 
financial difficulties.11 One child was born that year, and various medical expenses were 
incurred because Applicant did not have health insurance.12 With insufficient salary to 
maintain his monthly payments, some accounts became delinquent.  
In 2010, Applicant’s wife gave birth once more, again without health insurance.13 
She also decided to remain home to care for the three children.14 In May 2010, at about 
the same time the youngest child was born, Applicant’s job became “fragile” as the 
government contract with his employer was about to expire, and he had not received 
any offers from the incoming contractor. He was forced to look for employment 
elsewhere.15 He found a new job over 400 miles and eight and one-half hours away in 
another city.16 The monthly mortgage payments for his residence were too high for his 
salary, so Applicant vacated the residence and attempted to sell it.17 He consulted with 
a realtor, and because he owed more on the mortgage than the house was worth – the 
house was “under water” – he attempted to obtain a short sale.18 Although there were a 
number of potential buyers, the bank rejected every offer received.19 The property went 
into foreclosure in early 2011, and it was sold by the bank.20 
In September 2011, the process started anew when the contract on which 
Applicant was working was nearing expiration and Applicant’s employer was underbid

on the ensuing contract. In October 2011, he located another job several states away.21 
In June 2013, sequestration took place, and Applicant and other employees were laid 
off. He was given one week’s severance pay and was unemployed for two months.22 He 
was able to obtain another job with a new employer and relocated back to the state he 
had left in 2011. His new employer did not give him any relocation assistance or moving 
expense reimbursement, and he used whatever savings he had to pay for the relocation 
expenses.23 With insufficient money to maintain his monthly payments, some accounts 
became delinquent and others remained delinquent.  
In August 2014, Applicant engaged the professional services of financial 
counselors to assist him in negotiating repayment plans with his creditors and paying off 
some of his accounts. As part of the program, Applicant agreed to make monthly 
payments of $136 to the financial counseling company, to return or destroy all his credit 
cards, and to close all the accounts that had zero balances.24 Applicant recently 
furnished a personal monthly budget. A review of that document reveals a total monthly 
income of $5,893. With routine monthly living expenses of $4,093, including rent, 
utilities, food, and transportation, as well as his debt payment, he has approximately 
$1,800 available for discretionary spending or savings.25 All of Applicant’s newer 
accounts are current.26 
The SOR identified 12 delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, 
charged off, or foreclosed upon, as generally reflected by a February 2012 credit 
report27 and a February 2014 credit report.28 Some accounts listed in the credit reports 
have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other 
accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in some instances duplicating 
other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor 
name. Some accounts in the credit reports, as well as in the SOR, especially the 
medical accounts, do not reflect a creditor’s name. While the SOR includes some 
account numbers, there are a number of accounts reflected without account numbers. 
Several accounts in the credit reports are listed without any account numbers and 
others with only partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the SOR and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by 
the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below.

There is an unidentified medical account (SOR ¶ 1.a.) for $53.96 that was placed 
for collection.29 Applicant paid the collection agent, leaving a zero balance.30 The 
account has been resolved. There is another unidentified medical account (SOR ¶ 1.b.) 
for $307.01 that was placed for collection with the same collection agent.31 Applicant 
and the collection agent agreed to a repayment plan calling for monthly payments of 
$25.32 He made the first of his payments and as of May 20, 2014, the remaining balance 
had been reduced to $282.01.33 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
There is an emergency physicians medical account (SOR ¶ 1.c.) for $504 that 
was placed for collection.34 Applicant stated that he had been negotiating a repayment 
plan with the creditor, but the account was recently sold to another company, and he 
has been unable to identify or locate that new collection agent.35 He did not submit any 
documentation to support his claim that he had been in negotiations with the collection 
agent or that the account had been sold to another collection agent. The account has 
not been resolved. 
There is an unidentified medical account (SOR ¶ 1.d.) for $101 that was placed 
for collection.36 Applicant has attempted to identify or locate the unidentified creditor, but 
has been unable to do so.37 While the account is listed in the February 2014 Equifax 
Credit Report, it does not appear in the April 2014 Equifax Credit Report. There is no 
indication that the account was deleted because of the statute of limitations. Since the 
original source document for the allegation in the SOR has been superseded by a 
newer source document, I conclude the account has been resolved. 
There is an unidentified medical account (SOR ¶ 1.e.) for $2,315 that was placed 
for collection.38 Applicant has attempted to identify or locate this unidentified creditor as 
well, but has been unable to do so.39 While the account is listed in the February 2014 
Equifax Credit Report, it does not appear in the April 2014 Equifax Credit Report. There

There is a medical account (SOR ¶ 1.f.) for $308 that was placed for collection.40 
Applicant negotiated a repayment plan with the creditor, and it was agreed that he 
would make monthly payments of $25 until the account is resolved.41 His first payment 
was made in May 2014, with others in June 2014 and July 2014.42 The account is in the 
process of being resolved. 
There is a medical account (SOR ¶ 1.g.) for $1,434 that was placed for 
collection.43 Applicant negotiated a repayment plan with the creditor, and it was agreed 
that he would make monthly payments of $10 until the account is resolved.44 His first 
payment was made in May 2014.45 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
There is a bank credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.k.) with a $300 credit limit that was 
transferred to another bank. The account, with a past-due balance of $294, was placed 
for collection and charged off.46 The account was sold to a debt purchaser, identifying 
itself as a factoring company, in May 2013, and the high credit and past-due balance 
were initially increased to $506 (SOR ¶ 1.j.), and subsequently to $561 (SOR ¶ 1.h.).47 
Applicant and the debt purchaser entered into a repayment arrangement in May 2014, 
and Applicant has made monthly payments of $84.27 since that time.48 Adding 
confusion to the entire matter, on May 5, 2014, Applicant made a payment of $224.53 to 
another collection agent as a settlement of the entire account.49 The account, listed 
three separate times in the SOR, has either been resolved, or Applicant has overpaid it. 
There is a bank credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.i.) with a $2,000 credit limit and a 
past-due balance of $2,564 that was charged off.50 Applicant and the creditor entered

into a repayment arrangement in May 2014, and Applicant has made monthly payments 
of $75 since that time.51 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
As noted above, there is a home mortgage with a high credit of $123,525 that 
was transferred to a bank, and the bank subsequently foreclosed on the residence 
when there was a past-due balance of $21,384 and a remaining balance of $120,916 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.).52 Applicant contends the public records reflect that the house was sold for 
approximately $90,000, leaving a deficiency of about $30,000.53 He did not submit any 
documentation to support his contentions regarding the amount of the sale or the 
potential deficiency. He has never received any communication from the bank informing 
him of the sale or requesting payment of any deficiency.54 The bank was involved in 
substantial wrongdoing on a national scale involving improper foreclosures, and 
Applicant received a payment of $300 from the bank as part of the overall national 
settlement.55 The accuracy of the information appearing in the credit reports is open to 
question as the status is reflected merely as “foreclosure process started.” It remains 
unclear if the account has been resolved as part of the overall national settlement, or if it 
is currently in the process of being resolved. 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s program manager and a coworker are effusive in support of 
Applicant’s application for a security clearance. He has been characterized as 
trustworthy and reliable, and described as possessing exceptional work ethic and 
overall performance, as well as loyalty to his work and coworkers. Applicant’s judgment 
has never been questioned.56 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”57 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”58   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”61

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”62 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although he encountered some financial difficulties as early as 2008, 
Applicant’s most significant financial problems arose in 2010 and continued for several 
years thereafter. He was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments, and 
various accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged 
off. One account went into foreclosure. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are

clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.63  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties, initially 
since 2008, but reappearing in 2010, make it difficult to conclude that they occurred “so 
long ago” or were “so infrequent.” Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by 
frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, 
his financial problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. Because of the nature of 
his employment and the government contracting system, he worked on government 
contracts that routinely expire, causing him to periodically move around the country in 
his search for new employment. Obtaining employment frequently resulted in vacating 
one house and searching for another. Relocation expenses were rarely reimbursed. 
Health insurance was not always available. In addition, the national economic situation 
resulted in his sequestration and unemployment, and those factors merely exacerbated 
his financial problems.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing most of his delinquent accounts and 
working with his creditors in an effort to set up repayment arrangements.64 His overall 
repayment strategy has been successful, and he has resolved, in addition to the non-
SOR accounts, some of the accounts alleged in the SOR. He is also in the process of 
resolving other SOR-related accounts that are currently in repayment plans. It appears 
that he may have overpaid one account because it had been transferred to several 
collection agents, and he paid one and is paying another one. Because of the national 
home mortgage scandal involving his mortgage holder, it is unclear if there is a 
continuing deficiency or if the deficiency was wiped out as part of the overall national 
settlement.

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

He also engaged the professional services of financial counselors to assist him in 
negotiating repayment plans with his creditors and paying off some of his accounts. He 
agreed to make monthly payments to the financial counseling company, to return or 
destroy all his credit cards, and to close all the accounts that had zero balances. He has 
approximately $1,800 available each month for discretionary spending or savings. All of 
Applicant’s newer accounts are current. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.65 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.66       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, in 2008 
and again in 2010, various accounts became delinquent and were either placed for 
collection or charged off. One account eventually went to foreclosure. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. He 
has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. Applicant’s financial problems were not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. 
Rather, Applicant’s problems were largely beyond his control. Because of his highly 
specialized experience and expertise, the nature of his employment, and the

government contracting system, he was required to periodically move around the 
country in his search for new government contracts and new employment. Relocation 
expenses were rarely reimbursed, health insurance was not always available, and the 
fall-out from the poor national economy, his sequestration, and unemployment, were 
devastating to his financial well-being.  
Applicant did not ignore his debts. Instead, he addressed whatever delinquent 
debts he could, when he could. Applicant set up repayment arrangements. Applicant 
has resolved, or is in the process of resolving, nearly all of his accounts, including those 
identified in the SOR. As for two remaining accounts, once Applicant can identify and 
locate the creditors, he intends to resolve them. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:67 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt-resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.68 Overall, the evidence 
                                                          
67

68
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 
2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd.

leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
