MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant fell behind on some financial obligations due to reduced work hours and 
having to care for his daughter and his daughter’s sister after the girls’ mother was 
deployed for the U.S. military. Applicant enrolled five accounts totaling $31,878 in a debt 
repayment program, into which he has paid $2,216 as of late March 2014, but he has no 
plan in place to resolve a $24,337 charged-off consumer credit debt. More progress is 
needed toward resolving his debt. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 13, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and explaining why it was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance. The DOD CAF took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Applicant answered the SOR allegations on January 14, 2014, and he requested a 
decision without a hearing. On February 19, 2014, the Government submitted a File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of nine exhibits (Items 1-9). DOHA forwarded a copy 
of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. 
Applicant received the FORM on February 26, 2014. He filed an undated response, which 
was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March 27, 2014. 
On March 28, 2014, Department Counsel indicated the Government had no objections to 
its admission. 
 
On April 3, 2014, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
On review of the file, I accepted Applicant’s rebuttal to the FORM into the record as 
Applicant exhibit (AE) A. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of December 13, 2013, Applicant owed 
$33,550 in charged-off consumer credit debt (SOR 1.a-1.c) and collection balances of 
$2,629 (SOR 1.d) and $205 (SOR 1.f). Applicant was also alleged to be 90 days or more 
past due in the amount of $1,563 on a mortgage balance of $55,356 (SOR 1.e). (Item 1.) 
When he answered the allegations, Applicant admitted the debts. He was working with a 
debt resolution firm to pay the debts in SOR 1.a-1.d. With the help of his father and 
brother, he was bringing the mortgage current and turning the account over to his brother. 
He added that the debt in SOR 1.f was scheduled to be satisfied in February 2014. (Item 
4.) 
 
After considering the Government’s FORM, including Applicant’s Answer (Item 4), 
and Applicant’s rebuttal (AE A) to the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old unmarried high school graduate with a six-year-old 
daughter.
1
 He served honorably on active duty in the enlisted ranks of the U.S. military 
from August 1999 to September 2007, and he has been a part-time reservist since 
September 2007. In July 2008, Applicant began working full-time in the defense industry, 
initially as a work control analyst under subcontract to a large defense contractor. Applicant 
left that job for a more stable position as a test engineer with his current employer in April 
2012. Applicant was granted a DOD Secret clearance around July 2000. (Item 5.) 
 
During his active duty service, Applicant opened several consumer credit accounts, 
including those accounts identified in SOR 1.a and 1.c, which he paid on time. (Item 8.) In 
June 2007, Applicant opened a credit card account with a $4,000 credit limit. In July 2007, 
he opened a credit card account with another lender, which had a credit limit of $2,200 
(SOR 1.d). When he separated from active duty in September 2007, he took out a $20,000 
                                                 
1 
Applicant’s daughter was born in February 2008. Reported address information shows that Applicant has 
been living at the same address as his daughter’s mother since at least November 2013. (Item 6.) Applicant 
lived there previously from July 2008 to February 2009 and, likely when she was deployed, from June 2010 to 
February 2011. (Item 5.)   
 
 3 
line of credit (SOR 1.b) to cover his living expenses. (Item 6.) High credit on the account 
reached $26,425. In October 2007, Applicant opened a credit card account with a $4,600 
credit limit (debt X, not in SOR).
2
 (Item 8.) 
 
Around 2010, the mother of Applicant’s daughter deployed with the U.S. military. 
Applicant assumed the responsibility of caring for his daughter and his daughter’s sister.
3
 
Applicant’s work hours were reduced by his employer around that same time. With his 
increased expenses and lower income, Applicant had to prioritize which bills would be paid. 
In mid-2010, he stopped paying on the accounts in SOR 1.a-1.d. Applicant continued to 
make timely payments on other accounts, including $377 per month on a $14,820 car loan 
taken out in April 2010 and $313 per month on a credit card account with a $15,000 
balance (debt Y, not in SOR). (Item 8.) 
 
On April 5, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an Electronic 
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to the financial record 
inquiries, he reported delinquent debts of approximately $20,000 (SOR 1.b) and $8,000 
(SOR 1.a and 1.c) from June 2010 because of “reduced hours at work.” He indicated that 
he was working with his creditors to resolve those debts. (Item 5.) 
 
As of April 11, 2013, Applicant’s credit record (Item 8) showed some accounts as 
delinquent and others as current. Applicant owed collection balances of $6,366 (SOR 1.a), 
$24,377 (SOR 1.b), and $2,847 (SOR 1.c) on the accounts listed on his e-QIP. His credit 
report showed three other delinquencies not previously reported: 
 
 The credit card account with a $2,200 limit, which had been opened in July 2007, 
was in collection with a $2,629 balance in May 2012 (SOR 1.d). The account had 
been in dispute. 
 
 A cable provider placed a $205 balance for collection in July 2012 (SOR 1.f). 
 
 Debt X was reportedly past due 60 days in the amount of $354 on a balance of 
$4,892. The account was reportedly in dispute. 
 
                                                 
2
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the DOHA Appeal Board listed five circumstances 
in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, stating: 
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive 
Section 6.3. 
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 
24, 2003)). Debt X and another significant debt (debt Y, $15,796 balance as of January 2014) were not alleged 
in the SOR. These debts are included in Applicant’s debt resolution program, so they are relevant to assessing 
the extent of his reform. 
 
3 
The girls’ mother had a daughter from another relationship. She left both girls in Applicant’s care. (Item 6.) 
 
 4 
Applicant was making payments according to terms on a couple of credit cards, including 
debt Y, which had a $15,635 balance. His car loan was also being repaid on time. (Item 8.) 
 
 On May 20, 2013, Applicant was interviewed about his delinquent debts by an 
authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Regarding the 
debts listed on his e-QIP, Applicant indicated that starting in April 2013, he began paying 
what he could afford toward the $20,000 line of credit debt (SOR 1.b) He expressed his 
intent to begin repaying another $8,000 of past-due debt (SOR 1.a and 1.c) around June 
2013. He denied any knowledge of additional delinquencies. He asserted that he had 
repayment arrangements in place for debt X. He did not recognize the $2,629 (SOR 1.d) or 
$205 (SOR 1.f) balances reportedly in collection. Applicant expressed his intent to research 
those debts within the next seven days and then arrange to repay them, if valid. Applicant 
explained that he had fallen behind because he had to care for his daughter and her sister 
with less income due to reduced work hours. Applicant indicated that he was presently 
paying child support of $669 per month to his daughter’s mother. (Item 6.) 
 
 As of September 27, 2013, Equifax Information Services was reporting three 
charged-off balances ($2,847 on SOR 1.a, $24,337 on SOR 1.b, and $6,366 on SOR 1.c) 
and a collection balance ($2,629 on SOR 1.d) on Applicant’s credit record. In addition, 
Applicant was 90 days past due in the amount of $1,563 on a $56,356 mortgage balance 
(SOR 1.e).
4
 Applicant had been 30 days late paying his auto loan and debt Y around 
March 2013, but those accounts were current as of August 2013. (Item 7.) 
 
 On September 30, 2013, the DOD CAF asked Applicant to provide evidence of any 
payments or repayment arrangements for his delinquencies. On November 18, 2013, 
Applicant entered into a debt resolution agreement, enrolling $31,878 in debt (SOR 1.a, 
1.c, 1.d, debt X, and debt Y). Applicant agreed to pay $554 monthly to the debt resolution 
firm from December 2013 to around July 2017. He arranged for automatic debit of $277 
every two weeks from his checking account. The debt resolution firm estimated that it 
would be able to settle Applicant’s debts for about $18,177.55. (Item 6; AE A.) 
 
 On November 21, 2013, Applicant provided the DOD CAF with a copy of his debt 
resolution agreement, confirming that SOR 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d were three of the five debts 
included in the plan. The $24,377 line of credit debt (SOR 1.b) was excluded from the initial 
plan. Applicant indicated that the debt resolution firm was “trying to locate this account.” 
Applicant averred that his mortgage loan (SOR 1.e) was current, although he provided 
documentation showing that the payment due November 1, 2013, had not been received 
by the lender on time. (Item 6; AE A.) The loan’s repayment history shows that the loan 
was deferred from September 1, 2013 through October 31, 2013. (AE A.) Applicant 
admitted that the cable debt (SOR 1.f) had not been satisfied, but a family member was 
reportedly investigating it. Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement for the 
DOD CAF in November 2013 showing he had monthly discretionary income of $134, after 
paying his monthly expenses (including $995 in rent and $669 in child support) and $614 
                                                 
4 
According to his e-QIP, Applicant was living with his daughter’s mother at her address when the mortgage 
was opened. The mortgage loan, which was taken out in October 2009, is on the address where Applicant’s 
older brother resides. (Items 5, 6, 9.) 
 
 
 5 
toward his debts ($554 to the debt resolution firm and $60 toward a credit card with a 
balance of $2,969). (Item 6.) 
 
 On December 13, 2013, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant, alleging $37,917 
in outstanding delinquent debt. (Item 1.) Applicant asserted in response on January 14, 
2014, that he was working through the debt resolution firm to resolve the debts in SOR 1.a-
1.d; that he was in the process of turning over the mortgage (SOR 1.e) to his brother; and 
that the cable debt (SOR 1.f) would be paid on February 1, 2014. (Item 4.) 
 
 As of February 2014, Equifax was showing that the balance of the cable debt in 
collection (SOR 1.f) had been reduced to $73. The mortgage loan (SOR 1.e) was current, 
but no progress had been made in reducing the balances of the accounts in the debt 
resolution program
5
 or of the charged-off line of credit debt in SOR 1.b. Applicant was $163 
behind in his payments on the credit card account that had been current as of November 
2013. Debts X and Y were also delinquent in the respective amounts of $234 and $1,189.  
Applicant had paid off his previous auto loan and taken on a new car loan, of $27,269, in 
October 2013. He was current in his $587 monthly payments on that car loan. (Item 9.) 
 
 As of March 25, 2014, Applicant had paid $2,216 into his debt resolution program, 
$554 more than his commitment under the plan. The debt management firm was actively 
negotiating with Applicant’s creditors and had not disbursed any funds. Applicant’s 
mortgage payments (SOR 1.e) for November 2013 and December 2013 were more than 
30 days late. The payments for January 2014 through March 2014 were late, but within 30 
days of the due date. (AE A.) It is unclear whether Applicant or a family member made the 
mortgage payments. Applicant also provided no evidence showing that he had turned over 
the loan to his brother. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
                                                 
5 
Applicant owed $2,847 on SOR 1.a, $6,366 on SOR 1.c, and $2,267 on SOR 1.d. He was $234 past due on 
debt X’s $4,914 balance and $1,189 past due on debt Y’s $15,796 balance as of January 2014. 
 
 6 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns about financial considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant owes $36,179 in debt on four accounts delinquent since 2010 (SOR 1.a-
1.d). In addition, a cable television debt of $250 was placed for collection in July 2012 
(SOR 1.f). In October 2009, Applicant took out a mortgage loan of $56,500 for his brother. 
The loan payments have been chronically late since May 2013. As of September 2013, 
Applicant’s loan was reported by Equifax as 90 days past due in the amount of $1,563 
(SOR 1.e), although apparently the loan was deferred from September 1, 2013 to October 
31, 2013. Even so, the payments since then have not been made on time. Disqualifying 
conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and ¶ 19(c), “a history of 
not meeting financial obligations,” apply. 
 
Applicant’s financial problems are too recurrent and recent to apply mitigating 
condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
 
 7 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Applicant knew as of his 
e-QIP in April 2013 that he had made no payments on three consumer credit accounts 
(SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), which had been delinquent since June 2010. When he was 
interviewed by the OPM investigator in May 2013, Applicant was advised that a cable 
provider had placed a $250 balance in collection in July 2012, and a credit card lender had 
placed a $2,379 balance for collection in May 2012. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” is partially implicated. Applicant attributes his financial problems 
to a reduction in his work hours around the time that he had to assume care for his 
daughter and his daughter’s sister. Applicant did not provide the details of his income loss, 
or of the costs of the girls’ care, so I cannot conclude whether his reliance on consumer 
credit was reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, the reduced work hours and 
the deployment of his daughter’s mother were factors outside of his control which had a 
negative impact on his finances. However, AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate Applicant’s 
inaction toward his delinquencies after he began working for his current employer in April 
2012. One year into his current, more stable job, he had made no payments on three 
known consumer credit debts totaling around $28,000 (SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) and past 
due since June 2010. In May 2013, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he had started 
paying what he could afford toward the debt in SOR 1.b. He expressed his intent to begin 
repaying the $8,000 in past-due debt (SOR 1.a and 1.c) around June 2013. Yet, the debts 
were not addressed before mid-November 2013, when he entered into the debt resolution 
program, which does not include his largest debt (SOR 1.b). Applicant also did not act fully 
responsibly toward these consumer credit lenders when, in October 2013, he took on a 
new car loan, to be repaid at $587 per month. He paid off his previous car loan (balance 
$8,364 as of August 2013), which he had been repaying at $377 per month, but one has to 
question his financial priorities in taking on a higher monthly car payment when his old 
debts were not being paid. 
 
The mortgage loan is still on his credit record, so Applicant remains legally 
responsible for the debt. Mortgage payments have continued to be late, although by less 
than 30 days, in 2014. Even so, the payments to bring the mortgage current, and to reduce 
the cable debt balance to $73, partially implicate mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” Applicant’s debt resolution program is considered a good-faith effort, albeit very 
belated, to resolve his debts under AG ¶ 20(d). In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant 
presented evidence showing that he has paid $2,216 into the program in the last three 
months, when he has committed to paying $1,662 within that time frame. These payments 
certainly weigh in his favor. However, it is too soon to fully mitigate the financial concerns 
under either AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
As of November 2013, Applicant had $134 in monthly discretionary income after 
paying his expenses, the $554 debt resolution program fee, and $60 toward a credit card 
 
 8 
account. His reported expenses included $580 in car expenses, which presumably covered 
his car payment, insurance, and gasoline. According to his February 19, 2014 credit report, 
his car payment is now $587 a month. So, his budget may be tighter than his personal 
financial statement suggests. As of January 2014, Applicant was $163 behind in his 
payments on the credit card account that had been current as of November 2013. Debts X 
and Y were also delinquent in the respective amounts of $234 and $1,189. Assuming that 
the funds for his payments on the three credit card accounts went to pay his debt 
resolution fees, it is unclear whether he has any funds available to address the $24,337 
debt in SOR 1.b. His total credit card debt exceeds $50,000. With $24,377 of his past-due 
debt excluded from his debt resolution program, and no payments yet to be disbursed to 
his creditors, it would be premature to conclude that his financial problems are likely to be 
resolved in the near future. 
 
Whole-Person Concept  
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
6
 
 
Applicant’s financial situation was negatively affected by reduced hours at his 
previous employment and by the military deployment of his daughter’s mother. He did not 
provide the details from which I could conclude that his reliance on consumer credit was 
entirely reasonable under the circumstances. Albeit in response to DOD CAF 
interrogatories, he has a plan established to address about half of his consumer credit 
debt. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis 
in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every 
debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates 
that he has ‘. . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and 
taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably 
consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in 
evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his 
                                                 
6
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 
 9 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(‘Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There 
is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
  
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is not required to satisfy all of his delinquent debts before he can be granted 
security clearance eligibility. As of late March 2014, the debt resolution firm is still 
negotiating with his creditors, and apparently trying to determine who holds the debt in 
SOR 1.b. Applicant cannot control when the debt firm acts on his behalf, but the lack of 
progress is due in large part to Applicant’s delay in addressing his past-due debts. At some 
future date, Applicant may be a good candidate for a security clearance, but his overall 
financial picture is not positive for a resolution of his financial problems in the near future. It 
is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990.). Based on the 
facts before me and the adjudicative guidelines that I am required to consider, I am unable 
to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a 
security clearance at this time.
