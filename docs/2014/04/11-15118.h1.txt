LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He did not present sufficient evidence to
mitigate the financial considerations security concern stemming from a defaulted
mortgage loan that is pending foreclosure. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On September 24, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR on October 14, 2013. Neither Applicant nor
Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the
written record.2
Thereafter, on November 25, 2013, Department Counsel submitted all relevant
and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of3
relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it December 24, 2013.
Then on January 15, 2014, a copy of the Directive was mailed to Applicant, who
received it February 5, 2014. Applicant has not replied to the FORM. The case was
assigned to me April 9, 2014.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security
clearance. His employment history includes working as a security officer for a freight
company during 1993–2010. He has also held a part-time job as an armed security
officer since 2007. He began his current job as a security officer for a federal contractor
in June 2010. He married in 1998, and they had one child. 
There is substantial evidence to support the SOR allegation that Applicant has a
past-due mortgage loan that is in foreclosure.  The relevant facts and circumstances4
about the mortgage loan are described below. 
After marrying, Applicant and his wife obtained a mortgage loan for the purchase
of a home in December 1998. The initial mortgage loan with lender #1 was for about
$123,000 and had a monthly payment of $1,506.  The loan was refinanced with lender5

#2 in 2004, with a balance of about $150,000 and a monthly payment of $1,667.  The6
loan was past due twice in 2006.  It was refinanced again with lender #2 in 2007, with a7
balance of about $243,000 and a monthly payment of $2,356.  The loan was refinanced8
with lender #3 (and its successor in interest) for the last time in 2009, with a balance of
about $278,000 and a monthly payment of $2,387.  Applicant and his wife experienced9
marital difficulties and they separated in December 2010. Thereafter, neither he nor his
wife had the means to pay the mortgage loan. They divorced in July 2011. 
A September 2011 credit report shows the mortgage loan had a balance of
$286,835; the account was 180 days past due; and foreclosure proceedings had been
initiated.  A February 2013 credit report shows that the loan had a balance of $305,00010
with a past-due balance of $70,000.  The most recent credit report from August 201311
shows that the loan had a balance of $312,000 with a past-due balance of $84,763.  As12
of March 5, 2013, the payoff amount for the loan was $337,019, as stated in a letter
from a law firm handling the foreclosure for the mortgage lender.  13
Applicant did not disclose the past-due mortgage loan in his August 2011
security clearance application.  During a background investigation in October 2011, he14
denied that the mortgage loan was in foreclosure and stated the home was for sale to
avoid foreclosure.  Applicant provided additional information in a March 8, 2013 letter15
to the DOD as follows:
Estimated original mortgage was $130,000. Reason why the mortgage fell
behind was because of separation. I moved and that lead to a divorce and
could not afford to pay the mortgage, rent, and child support all alone.
Nothing was done. From my knowledge last payment was December
2010. After December 2010, I no longer lived at the residence and my ex-
wife continued living at the property but because of the lack of

communication from my ex-wife I did not know anything on the status of
the mortgage. According to what my ex-wife has told me, the property is
up for sale or under foreclosure whichever comes first. All information on
the status of the property only my ex-wife knows. Neither of us were able
or are still able to afford the mortgage individually after the separation that
lead to a divorce.  16
In his October 15, 2013 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the
mortgage loan was in foreclosure. He repeated his previous explanation (e.g.,
separation, divorce, and child support). He stated that he called the mortgage lender
and was told that the foreclosure was in early stages, and he was trying to obtain
information about a short sale. 
 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As17
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt18
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An19
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting21
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An22
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate23
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme24
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it27
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant28
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 29
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise

questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  30
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history—the past-due mortgage loan that is
pending foreclosure—indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history31
of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more than sufficient to establish32
these two disqualifying conditions.  
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  I have considered all six33
in light of the facts and circumstances here, and none, individually or in combination,
are sufficient to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. Applicant, along
with his then wife, defaulted on a mortgage loan in 2011, the last payment being made
in about December 2010. The available information shows the foreclosure process is
ongoing. Although this financial problem appears to be due to Applicant’s marital
troubles, I cannot conclude that he acted responsibly under the circumstances for two
reasons. First, the history of the mortgage loan shows that Applicant and his then wife
used or treated their home like a credit card. Starting in 1998 with a modest balance of
about $123,000 and a reasonable monthly payment, they refinanced the mortgage loan
multiple times running up the balance to $278,000 as of 2009; the payoff amount is now
more than $300,000. Second, since leaving the marital home in December 2010,
Applicant has been inattentive to his responsibility for the mortgage loan. It is probable
that but for the security clearance process, he would still be ignoring the matter. Those
are not the actions of a responsible person. 
With that said, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or
enforcing tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment,34
reliability, and trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In
evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 35

SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.35
Based on the available evidence, Applicant has not taken enough significant actions to
mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. In light of the facts and circumstances
here, the record evidence presents uncertainty, and that uncertainty equates to doubt
about Applicant’s fitness for access to classified information. 
After weighing the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating
the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant did not present36
sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the security concern. Accordingly,
Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
