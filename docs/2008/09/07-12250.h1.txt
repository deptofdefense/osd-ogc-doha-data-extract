HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP), on March 9, 2007. On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On April 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 8, 2008. 
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 19, 2008 and 
transferred to me on May 21, 2008. On June 12, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, 
scheduling the hearing for July 9, 2008. On July 7, 2008, Applicant requested a delay. 
The delay was granted and the case was rescheduled for August 5, 2008. The case 
was heard on that date. The Government offered six exhibits which were admitted as 
 
2 
 
 
Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 6 without objection. Applicant testified. The record was 
held open until August 19, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence. 
Applicant timely submitted a six-page document that was admitted as AE A without 
objection. Department Counsel’s response to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibit is marked 
as Hearing Exhibit 1. The transcript was received on August 12, 2008. Based upon a 
review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.c, 1.e, 1.f. 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o. He denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, 
1.l, and 1.n.  
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor 
seeking a security clearance. He has held his current position since February 2007.  He 
has a bachelor of science degree in computer science. He is married and has three 
children, ages 15, 12 and 5 months. (Tr at 7-8, 22; Gov 1.)   
 
On March 9, 2007, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) A subsequent background investigation revealed that 
Applicant had 15 delinquent accounts, with a total approximate balance of $30,254. 
(Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 4; Gov 5; Gov 6.)   
 
Applicant’s delinquent accounts include: a $555 delinquent medical account 
placed for collection in May 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $39 returned 
check placed for collection in January 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $482 
insurance account placed for collection in January 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.c; Gov 2 at 6,11; Gov 
3 at 8, 14); a $150 delinquent account placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.d: 
Gov 2 at 7,15; Gov 3 at 15; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $112 cable television account 
placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 7, 12; Gov 3 at 15; Gov 4 at 
2); a $213 satellite television account placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.f: 
Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 15); a $112 returned check placed for collection in March 2006 
(SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 9); a $210 cell phone account placed for collection in 
April 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 2 at 6, 12; Gov 3 at 9, 15; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $1,966 
delinquent account that was charged off in January 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 2 at 6, 13; 
Gov 3 at 11; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $160 returned check that was charged off in 
December 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2); a $7,543 
delinquent automobile loan that was charged off in June 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 2 at 13; 
Gov 3 at 11; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2); a $952 state tax lien entered in January 2004 
(SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 3 at 4-5; Gov 5 at 1); a $5,125 federal tax lien entered on April 1, 2003 
(SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 2 at 6, 9; Gov 3 at 4-6; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 1); a $439 
state tax lien entered in January 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 2 at 6, 9-10; Gov 3 at 4, 6; Gov 
4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 1); and a $12,196 federal tax lien entered on February 16, 
2001 (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 2 at 6, 10; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 5 at 4).

Applicant’s financial problems began in 2001 with the federal tax lien filed by the 
Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.). (SOR ¶ 1.o) His ability to pay his financial obligations 
was further hindered a result of being laid off from February 2005 to October 2005. 
During his period of unemployment, he did some small jobs, but it was not enough to 
meet his expenses. His wife has been unemployed since 2005. (Tr at 20.) He continued 
to incur delinquent accounts after finding full-time employment. He consulted a credit 
counselor about seven years ago and considered filing for bankruptcy. He has not 
attended any recent financial counseling. (Tr at 53.) 
 
Of the debts alleged in the SOR, the $7,543 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k has been 
paid off.  Applicant’s wages were garnished to pay off this debt. (AE A at 4-5; Gov 2 at 
10.) Credit reports indicate the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e (Gov 6 at 2) and SOR ¶ 1.h 
(Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2) are paid. The state tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m 
have been paid. (AE A at 6.) The total balance owed for federal income taxes alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.o is now approximately $31,000. Applicant states the I.R.S. has 
placed the account on hold until he is able to start making payments. He is not able to 
arrange a payment plan with the I.R.S. (Tr at 41-42.) Applicant claims the debts alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, and 1.j were paid, but provided no proof such as a receipt verifying 
payment. (Tr at 32-33, 35, 39.) He has not paid the remaining debts.  Three weeks prior 
to the hearing, his van was repossessed due to lack of payment. (Tr at 54.)  
   
Prior to being laid off in 2005, Applicant earned between $30,000 to $40,000 
annually. His present salary is $63,000. (Tr at 23.) His monthly take home pay is 
approximately $2,500. He supplements his income with occasional side jobs.  His 
monthly expenses are approximately $2,800. (Tr at 44-49.)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
 
4 
 
 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC & 19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. The SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts 
totaling approximately $30,254.  Of that amount, $18,712 was for delinquent federal and 
state income taxes.  
 
5 
 
 
  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant’s financial problems continue. Three weeks prior to the hearing, his van was 
repossessed, which will likely result in a deficiency judgment. Most of the delinquent 
debts remain unresolved. Applicant currently operates at a negative balance each 
month. His expenses are $300 more than his income.       
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to the loss of 
Applicant’s job in 2005 and his subsequent nine-month period of unemployment. His 
wife also lost her job in 2005 and has not worked since that time.  However, this 
mitigating condition cannot be fully applied because Applicant has taken minimal steps 
towards resolving his delinquent accounts once he obtained full-time employment in 
February 2007. It cannot be concluded that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances with regards to resolving his delinquent accounts.     
 
FC MC ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant attended financial counseling approximately seven 
years ago and did not attempt to attend recent financial counseling. Although the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.k was paid by garnishing Applicant’s wages, and the state tax debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.n are resolved, the remaining delinquent accounts remain unresolved. 
His federal income tax debt has increased to $31,000. His financial problems are not 
likely to be resolved in the near future.  
 
FC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, with respect to the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n. However, Applicant has not met his burden of proof 
pertaining to the resolution of the other debts in the SOR.  He took minimal action 
towards resolving these accounts. 
 
Guideline F is decided against Applicant.  
   
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
 
6 
 
 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information 
about his work history. I considered Applicant’s period of unemployment since 2005,  
and his efforts to resolve some of the accounts. However, the majority of the delinquent 
accounts remain unresolved. Applicant’s outstanding federal tax debt has increased to 
$31,000. His van was recently repossessed. Applicant’s budgetary information provided 
at hearing reveals that his expenses are greater than his income. It is too soon to 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised under financial considerations. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to 
mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
