APPEAL BOARD DECISION
ON APPLICANT’S REQUEST
FOR RECONSIDERATION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
On July 29, 2008, the Board issued an Appeal Decision in this case.  On August 3, 2008,
Applicant submitted a request for reconsideration of that decision.  He further submitted an
addendum to his request on August 18, 2008.  The Chief Department Counsel advised that he would
not file a Reply Brief.
The Board has inherent authority to entertain requests to reconsider its decisions.  However,
there is no right to reconsideration; the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise
its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0621 at 1-2 (App.
Bd. Nov. 23, 1999).
Applicant requests that the Board reconsider its prior decision and grant him a security
clearance, arguing that he had successfully mitigated the Guideline E security concerns in his case
under the whole person factors.
The Board has considered Applicant’s brief in light of our prior decision.  Applicant has
failed to articulate a persuasive reason to change the Board’s resolution of this case.  See ISCR Case
No. 06-25684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 10, 2008).  Accordingly, the request is denied.
