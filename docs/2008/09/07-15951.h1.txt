Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on May 
5, 2005. On May 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the 
revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 
1, 2006.  
  
 On June 6, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 23, 2008. 
The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. On July 31, 2008, a Notice of Hearing 
was issued, scheduling the hearing for August 21, 2008. The case was heard on that 
date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government 
Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5. Applicant testified. She offered ten exhibits which were admitted as 
Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-10. The transcript was received on September 2, 2008.

Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  
 
Applicant is a 61-year-old truck driver whose company subcontracts with a 
Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.  She has been 
employed with her company since 1998. She has a ninth-grade education. She dropped 
out of school in order to care for her ill father. She is able to read and write English. She 
is single and has a daughter and two grandchildren, ages 11 and 8. This is her first time 
applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 6-9, 72-73; Gov 1.)  
 
On May 5, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application, Standard 
Form 86, in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1.) A subsequent background 
investigation revealed that Applicant had 26 delinquent accounts, an approximate total 
balance of $106,049.  The delinquent accounts included:  a $7,504 account placed for 
collection in March 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 1, 3; Gov 5 at 16); a $1,275 
medical account placed for collection in October 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 
1; Gov 5 at 17); a $2,099 gas credit card account placed for collection in January 2003 
(SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 10); a $56 cable television account placed 
for collection in August 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 18); a $8,419 
credit card account placed for collection in March 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 
1; Gov 5 at 20); a $58 gas bill placed for collection in November 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 3 
at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 21); a $2,395 credit card account that was charged off in July 
2002 (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 9). 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $2,700 account that was charged off in 
July 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 3 at 2); a $7,916 credit card account that was charged off in 
October 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 26); a $7,504 credit card 
account that was charged off in April 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 
10); a $9,670 credit card account that was charged off in April 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.k; Gov 3 
at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 10); a $8,419 credit card account that was  charged off in April 
2003 (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 10); a $361 gas credit card placed for 
collection in October 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 22); a $480 cell 
phone account placed for collection in December 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 
3; Gov 5 at 19); a $2,425 department store credit card account placed for collection in 
August 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 17). 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $10,854 credit card account placed for 
collection in December 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.p: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 5); a $559 
account placed for collection in January 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.q: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 3); a 
$11,775 credit card account placed for collection in January 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.r: Gov 3 at 
3; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 4, 7); a $1,672 gas credit card account placed for collection in 
August 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.s: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 5, 7); a $707 gas credit card 
 
3 
 
 
account placed for collection in November 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.t: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 
5 at 4, 7); a $96 utility account placed for collection in September 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.u: Gov 
3 at 4; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 5, 8); a $149 cell phone account placed for collection in May 
2004 (SOR ¶ 1.v: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 4, 7); a $98 gas credit card account 
placed for collection in July 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.w: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 5, 6); a 
$3,011 account placed for collection in September 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.x: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 
at 4; Gov 5 at 18); and a $15,487 amount owed as a result of truck repossession in 
June 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.y: Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 11).         
 
In 1996, Applicant lost her job as an assistant branch manager when her 
company closed. She worked there for 30 years. She received $42,000 when the 
business closed. She used the money to attend truck driving school and started a truck 
driving business. She had good credit at the time. She was able to purchase four trucks 
for her business from 1998 through 2001. (Tr at 24, 45-46; AE C.) 
 
In 2001, Applicant began to have serious health problems. She had severe nerve 
damage in both arms. A doctor advised her that she may need to have both arms 
amputated. Applicant worried about who would take care of her. Her brother had 
cerebral palsy and lived in a home most of his life and did not receive excellent care. 
Concerned the same thing would happen to her, she became depressed and did not 
work for 14 months starting in approximately September 2001. She never sought 
treatment for depression. (Tr at 16, 33, 69-72; Gov 2 at 4-7.)  
 
Around 2002, a friend told Applicant to get a second opinion and referred her to a 
doctor.  Based on the doctor’s opinion, Applicant had surgery on her left arm to relieve 
the nerve damage. She had health insurance at the time. After the surgery, she 
discovered that her health insurance company went out of business and she was left 
with a $30,000 surgery bill in addition to her other debts. (Tr at 15, 42-43; Gov 2 at 4; 
AE A; AE B.) Applicant still needs surgery on her right arm as well as cataract surgery. 
The surgery for her right arm will cost approximately $30,000. She is unable to get 
health insurance based on her pre-existing condition. (Tr at 25, 63, 68; Gov 2 at Gov 2 
at 4-6.) 
   
Applicant admits that she owes a lot of bills. She disputes the debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.h. 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.u, and 1.x because she does not recognize the 
creditor. She disputes the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.w because the credit cards 
were reported as stolen. She did not formally dispute any of the accounts with the credit 
reporting agencies. (Tr at 47-60.) She claims the following debts are duplicates: SOR ¶¶ 
1.a and 1.j, and SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.v. Upon review of the credit reports (Gov 3, Gov 4, 
Gov 5), it appears the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.j, and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.l 
are duplicates. Essentially, the debts were sold to a collection agency. For this reason, I 
find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.l.   
 
Applicant is unable to pay any of her debts. She is focusing on saving money for 
her surgery. She sought the advice of a credit counselor who advised her to file for 
 
4 
 
 
bankruptcy. She claims she does not have enough money to hire a bankruptcy attorney. 
(Tr at 45, 48-49, 63-64.)  
 
Applicant describes her current financial situation as tough. She begged her 
doctor to allow her to go back to work because she needed the money. She often 
borrows money from her boyfriend, who is also her truck driving partner, to pay for her 
medications. She currently earns approximately $800 to $1,000 per month. She lives 
with her boyfriend. She does not pay rent but shares in buying groceries. She also pays 
her medical and phone bill. Her medicine costs around $300 a month. She would love to 
pay her debts but her focus is on her health issues. Her medical expenses in 2007 
totaled $5,379. Her total income was approximately $14,283. (Tr at 22; 61-63, 69; AE 
F.) She is current on her federal and state taxes. (Tr at 73; AE H; AE I; AE J.) 
 
The general manager of the company who loaned Applicant money to purchase 
four trucks wrote a letter on her behalf.  Prior to approving the loans, Applicant’s 
credentials and credit were investigated. It was discovered that she had an excellent 
credit rating. He has firsthand knowledge of her health problems, having acted as a 
recovery agent for the lenders. He notes she was unable to find a suitable manager for 
her business. She voluntarily surrendered the trucks. He states Applicant is “an honest, 
honorable and caring person that unfortunately had an overwhelming business problem, 
which marred her otherwise excellent credit and personal ratings.” (AE C.) 
 
Applicant’s boyfriend and truck driving partner wrote a letter on her behalf. He 
was also present at the hearing to provide emotional support to Applicant. He has 
known Applicant for about five years.  He finds her to be “an honest, loyal and dedicated 
worker and partner in life.”  He states that in an attempt to increase her income she put 
a team of drivers in her truck and went to work on his truck as a co-driver. The drivers 
wrecked the truck.  He states that they have carried numerous sensitive loads for 
various companies and government agencies, including DOD. (AE D.)   
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
5 
 
 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
 
6 
 
 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. From 2001 to 2007, Applicant has 
accumulated over $89,766 in delinquent debt. A substantial amount of the debt relates 
to her failed truck driving business. She is unable to pay these debts due to her limited 
income and medical issues. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant’s history of financial difficulties is too recent to apply this mitigating condition.  
All of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. 
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant’s health issues 
contributed to her financial situation. The failure of her health insurance company further 
aggravated Applicant’s financial situation since she found herself responsible for a lot of 
medical bills.  Currently, Applicant suffers from numerous health problems and is unable 
to get health insurance. There were circumstances beyond her control that adversely 
affected Applicant’s finances. However, Applicant did not work for 14 months because 
she was depressed about her health situation. While the trauma and anguish she 
experienced over her health issues is understandable, Applicant’s decision to not work 
for 14 months was a factor within her control and was a major cause in her trucking 
business’ financial problems. It cannot be concluded that Applicant acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.  
 
FC MC ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. While Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency who 
recommended that she file for bankruptcy, she took no action towards filing for 
bankruptcy, claiming that she had no money to pay an attorney. Her delinquent 
accounts remain and it is unlikely that her financial situation will improve in the future.  
FC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant has not taken steps towards 
resolving her delinquent accounts.   
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
 
7 
 
 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s medical 
conditions and her inability to obtain health insurance. I considered Applicant’s 
favorable character reference letters. However, a security risk remains because  
Applicant has an overwhelming amount of debt which she is incapable of paying. An 
inability to pay one’s debts remains a security concern under financial considerations. 
The financial considerations concern is not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
