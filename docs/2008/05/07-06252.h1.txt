Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:
Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern that arises
from his numerous severely delinquent accounts.  
On September 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted an answer to the SOR, dated September 30, 2007, in which he admitted the
allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g, denied the allegations contained
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS

in subparagraphs 1.h through 1.n, and requested a clearance decision based on the written
record without a hearing.  
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 19,
2007, that was mailed to Applicant on November 21, 2007. That copy of the FORM was
apparently not received by Applicant. The FORM was resent to Applicant on February 20,
2008. Applicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his
objections to any information contained in the FORM or to submit any additional
information he wished to be considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on
February 27, 2008, but did not submit a response to the FORM or object to anything
contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned to me on May
2, 2008.
Findings of Fact
After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant is 48 years old. He was employed as a security officer by a defense
contractor for several months in 2006 until he was laid off due to the loss of his interim
security clearance. Applicant worked as a security officer outside the defense industry from
August 2002 until September 2005, and as a cashier in a retail store beginning in June
2006 until an undisclosed date. He was unemployed from September 2000 until August
2002, as a result of being fired from a job as a legal clerk with the U.S. Army, and again
from October 2005 until June 2006, for undisclosed reasons. 
Applicant graduated from high school in May 1978, and obtained an associate of
arts degree in May 1986. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1978 until
December 1979. Applicant was married in July 1982, and that marriage ended in divorce
in March 1983. He did not report having any dependents in the security clearance
application he submitted in 2006.
SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a judgment that was entered against Applicant in or
about 2001 in the amount of $3,130. He admits this debt but claims it is the result of a
dispute with a former landlord over water damage that was done to his apartment as a
result of a fire in an upstairs apartment. It remains unsatisfied.
The SOR alleges two charged off accounts, subparagraphs 1.g and 1.k, that are
owing in the total amount of $2,126. Applicant admitted the debt alleged in subparagraph
1.g, although his credit report indicates he has filed a dispute over that debt. He denied the
debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k, but in the explanation he provided in his SOR answer
he acknowledged he had a credit card with that creditor but indicated he objected to the
amount alleged because $1,074 of that amount represents accrued interest. Neither debt
has been satisfied.
 The SOR alleges two additional collection accounts in subparagraphs 1.l and 1.m that are not2
included in this total. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l is clearly the same debt that is alleged in
subparagraph 1.a. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m appears very strongly to be the same debt alleged
in subparagraph 1.i based upon the amount listed under the “credit limit” heading in Applicant’s August 2006
credit report (SOR Item 6).

The SOR alleges nine accounts, totalling $6,726, that have been submitted for
collection.  Applicant admits his responsibility for each of the debts listed in subparagraphs2
1.b through 1.f. He denied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, but admitted owing the
creditor and indicated he objected to the debt because it involved rental of a storage unit
and the creditor refusing to return his property although he was less than three months in
arrears at the time of the company’s refusal. He denied the allegations contained in
subparagraphs 1.j and 1.n by asserting he did not recognize the listed creditors. Both
allegations are supported by the contents of Applicant’s credit reports included as part of
the FORM. None of these creditors has been satisfied. 
Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to being unjustly fired from his employment
with the U.S. Army in September 2000, and the resulting unemployment. However, he
provided no explanation why he did not make any payments or payment arrangements on
any of the debts while he was employed from August 2002 until September 2005, and
again for a period in 2006. He submitted a personal financial statement in June 2007
(FORM Item 7) in which he listed $115 as his only monthly income and $483 as his
monthly living expenses.         
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying
Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,
each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the
factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence
of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial
considerations) with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of3 4
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5

although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the6
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to7
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable8
clearance decision.9
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard10
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to11
classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  12
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Applicant has 12 severely delinquent debts, totalling almost $12,000, that have been
submitted for collection, charged off as bad debts, or that resulted in a judgment being
entered against him. All of those debts have been delinquent for at least a couple of years.
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC
19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. 
Applicant attributes his severely delinquent debt to the nearly two years
unemployment he experienced between 2000 and 2002. However, he was gainfully
employed from August 2002 until September 2005, and again for a period of time in 2006,
but failed to make any payment or payment arrangements on any of the debts during those
periods of employment. He did not submit any evidence to indicate he has sought financial
5
counselling. The financial statement he submitted in June 2007 strongly indicates he not
only lacks the ability to make any payment on any of the debts but he is for all intents and
purposes destitute. Finally, he provided no evidence to indicate he is or has been seeking
employment or doing anything else to remedy his current financial situation. Accordingly,
Applicant is not entitled to application of any Guideline F mitigating condition.
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
his acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
I have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of
the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions. I conclude Applicant has failed
to mitigate the security concern caused by the financial considerations present in this case.
He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of
persuasion. Guideline F is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - k: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.l & m For Applicant
Subparagraph   1.n Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
