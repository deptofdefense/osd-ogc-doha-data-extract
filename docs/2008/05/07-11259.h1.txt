Statement of the Case 
 
On September 25, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On November 20, 
2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
1Item 4. There is no allegation of falsification of the 2007 SF 86.   
 
2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Nov. 20, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in 
the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise.

Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified 
and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On December 3, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected 
to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 10, 2008, was provided to 
him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.4 Applicant provided a two-page letter with four 
enclosures. Applicant’s submission was received at DOHA on April 30, 2008. 
Department counsel did not object to consideration of the documents Applicant 
submitted in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant admitted responsibility for seven 
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e, 1.g and 1.h), said he paid one debt (SOR ¶ 1.i), and was 
current on his debt payments for one debt (SOR ¶ 1.j)(Item 2). He also admitted his 
1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged many of his debts (SOR ¶ 1.f). His admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is 55 years old.5 He married his current spouse in 1978. His children 
were born in 1979, 1981, 1983, and 1985. He graduated from a technical community 
college in 1999 with an AAS in Information Systems degree. From 2002 to the present 
he has been employed by a university as an instructor. From July 2006 to present, he 
has also been employed by a government contractor as a consulting system engineer.  
From 2003 to 2006, he was an instructor at a community college. From 1999 to 2003, 
he was employed as a customer support engineer.  He has not served in the United 
States military. He has never been fired from a job, and has no police record. He has 
3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Mar. 13, 2008; and 
Applicant’s receipt is signed and dated Apr. 1, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that 
he had 30 days after Applicant’s receipt to submit information.

stated otherwise.

not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in 
a sensitive position.  
 
On his security clearance application, he disclosed that a lien had been placed 
against his property for failure to pay debts. He described a $74,000 lien for tax years 
1995 to 1998. He also said he was current with all taxes for the last seven years (1999 
to 2005). For financial delinquencies, he disclosed a delinquent credit card debt for 
$3,712.  He explained, “I realize that my debts should be paid on time. I just want to say 
that I have spent the last 26 year[s] raising my 4 children and helping them through[] 
college and their entrance into adult life. My income has gotten better and my burden is 
less.” (Item 4 at page 35).   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR lists nine debts that were delinquent in the last 25 years, and a Chapter 
7 bankruptcy. He was self-employed between 1986 and 1998 (FORM Response). He 
filed tax returns, but did not pay or sometimes fully pay his taxes (FORM Response). 
Some of his tax debts were subsequently paid and some lapsed due to the Internal 
Revenue Services’ (IRS) failure to file a levy on his accounts. In 2008, he refinanced his 
home and paid his last remaining, legally enforceable federal tax debt. Specific 
information about each of the SOR allegations listed in ¶ 1 follows:  
 
a. On April 14, 1993, the Federal IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for 
$64,698 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1984, 1986, and 1987 through 
1991. On May 19, 1997, and August 15, 1999, the IRS issued Certificates of Release 
for the tax liens because more than ten years had elapsed since the assessments.  The 
unpaid balance of assessment was $64,698 according to the certificate filed on August 
15, 1999. 
 
b. On June 2, 1986, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $4,399 
for taxes and additions assessed for the tax period ending on March 31, 1985. On 
March 10, 2002, the IRS issued a Certificate of Release for this tax lien.  
 
c. In March 1993, Applicant’s state tax authority filed a state tax lien against 
Applicant for $10,516. As of August 31, 2007, his state tax authority reported Applicant 
having no outstanding tax liability to his state of residence.  
 
d. On April 30, 1993, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $5,021 
for taxes and additions assessed for tax year 1992. On August 15, 1999, the IRS issued 
a Certificate of Release for this tax lien.  
 
e. On May 23, 1996, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $18,896 
for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1993 and 1994. In May 2005, Applicant 
paid the account balance owed for taxes and additions assessed for tax year 1993. In 
August 2007, his account balance of $5,144.00 for taxes and additions assessed for tax 
year 1994 was cleared due to a statutory expiration. On September 6, 2007, the IRS 
 
4 
 
 
issued a Certificate of Release for the tax lien, which listed an unpaid balance of 
assessment of $18,896.  
 
f. Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in May 1996. This Bankruptcy 
discharge was effective in August 1996.  
 
g. In March 1999, Applicant’s state tax authority filed a state tax lien against 
Applicant for $7,497. As of August 31, 2007, his state tax authority reports Applicant 
had no outstanding tax liability to his state of residence.  
 
h. On February 18, 2005, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for 
$74,730 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In 
September 2007, his account balance of $11,260.00 for taxes and additions assessed 
for tax year 1995 was cleared due to a statutory expiration. As of September 17, 2007, 
Applicant still owed $58,825.00 for taxes and additions assessed for tax years 1996, 
1997, and 1998.  On February 29, 2008, he paid the IRS $35,457, resolving this debt. 
 
i. As of August 20, 2007, Applicant owed about $1,362 on a credit card account. 
On November 22, 2007, Applicant paid this debt in full (Item 2 (Encl to SOR Response, 
letter from creditor, dated Dec. 3, 2007)). 
 
j. As of August 20, 2007, Applicant owed about $4,000 on an account that was 
past due. On July 30, 2007, he paid $681, and the creditor indicated on August 22, 
2007, the debt was $2,067 (Item 6). 
 
Applicant had ample warning about the security concerns of his delinquent debt. 
On August 8, 2007, he responded to interrogatories from DOHA (Item 5). He explained 
that his four children attended college in the following years: (1) 1998-2002; (2) 1999, 
2004-2007; (3) 2001-2006; and (4) 2003-2007. He described August 2007 as his “first 
month of financial freedom from our Children in 27 years.”  His plan was to borrow 
against the equity in his home to pay his tax debt.  A mortgage statement attached to 
Item 6 indicates on July 30, 2007, Applicant’s mortgage balance was $121,302; his 
monthly payment was $1,708; and this included a payment on a past due amount of 
$6,661 (about half of this amount was for past due late charges).  He subsequently 
brought his mortgage to current status.  
 
Applicant’s tax returns for the last seven years show the following adjusted gross 
income (AGI): 2001-$104,857; 2002-$105,940; 2003-$122,822; 2004-$64,112; 2005-
$69,252; 2006-$98,701; and 2007-$147,467 (Item 6 and FORM Response). His AGI 
over those seven years totals $713,151 and his average AGI is $101,878. Applicant 
paid all state taxes owed from 2000 to 2006 (Item 6, statement from state tax authority, 
dated Aug. 1, 2007).  
 
Applicant’s monthly gross salary is $12,582, his monthly net salary is $8,800, his 
monthly expenses are $3,710 and his monthly debt payments are $3,483 (Item 6).  His 
monthly net remainder is about $1,600 (Item 6).

Applicant refinanced his home and on February 29, 2008, and paid the IRS 
$35,457, resolving his last remaining, legally enforceable delinquent tax debt (Form 
Response). The IRS provided a release for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2001 
(Form Response). Applicant does not currently have any delinquent debt. See credit 
report dated April 15, 2008, showing no delinquent debt (Form Response). 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”6 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
6 See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” ISCR 
Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “This is something less 
than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the 
evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. 
Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but 
less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides one Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case. The government 
established AG ¶ 19(c), which states, “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” AG 
¶ 19(g) does not apply because Applicant did file a federal tax return each year. 
Applicant’s profound history of delinquent tax debt is documented in his response to 
DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response and his FORM response. He has a history of 
excessive and chronic indebtedness. Although he recently made significant progress 
resolving his SOR-listed debts, his tax debts were delinquent for so many years that his 
recent efforts do not fully undercut the government allegations. AG ¶ 19(c) fully applies.   
7 “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”

  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant avoided paying some of his federal taxes because the IRS failed to 
aggressively pursue payment though filing of tax levies.8 He became aware of the 
security significance of his financial problems on August 9, 2007, when he responded to 
DOHA inquiries concerning his delinquent debts. The importance of resolving his debts 
was reinforced when he responded to the SOR on December 3, 2007. His effort to 
resolve his debts in February 2008, when he refinanced his residence, was the type of 
action he should have taken earlier. His decisions over most of the last ten years to 
emphasize paying for his children’s college educations over his responsibilities to pay 
his delinquent federal and state taxes is not an appropriate prioritization of payments. 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) because 
8 A levy must be made or proceeding in court begun to collect a federal tax lien within 10 years 
after a tax assessment is made. See 26 U.S.C. § 6502; United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 119 
(2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding, see United 
States v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d 796 (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see 
United States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or 
after Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. Id. I infer that collectibility of some of his federal tax liens was barred by 
the 10-year statute of limitations.    
    
 
8 
 
 
                                                          
he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts.9 His 
overall conduct pertaining to state and federal taxes over the last ten years casts doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
Applicant does not receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because he did not 
provide evidence that he received financial or credit counseling. There is record 
evidence of “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” and 
he receives substantial credit because his current financial condition as of February 29, 
2008, is excellent.  
 
Guideline ¶ 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to 
establish that Applicant showed good faith10 in the resolution of his debts. AG ¶ 20(e) is 
not applicable because he did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis 
of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue” with respect to his 
SOR debts.  
 
Applicant did not show sufficient responsibility under the circumstances to fully 
mitigate security concerns. He has been employed for the last seven years, and his 
adjusted gross income for those seven years averaged over $100,000 per year. He 
should have showed a consistent track record of significant, delinquent tax debt 
reduction. His financial problems may recur. He should have been more diligent and 
made greater efforts over a longer period of time to resolve his delinquent debts. He has 
not carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of 
the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the passage of time has mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to most of his financial problems, and I find For Applicant 
9“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 
12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 
(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

on all SOR paragraphs except for SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h. No mitigating conditions 
sufficiently apply to remediate all security concerns. 
  
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG  ¶ 2(c).   
Applicant’s record of good employment weighs in his favor. His stable marriage 
and his dedication to the welfare of his four children support approval of his clearance. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. Aside from his tax problems, he is a law 
abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct is more substantial. 
Applicant was well aware of his tax responsibilities, and had ample resources to pay his 
fair share of taxes.  He did not become truly serious about paying his back taxes until he 
became aware of the security significance of these debts. His efforts to resolve his tax 
debts were insufficient when compared to available income that he could have used to 
address his delinquent debts, especially from 2001 to 2003. He did not show adequate 
actions for timely resolution of his tax debts. Instead he chose to rely on the IRS’ failure 
to file tax levies against his income and property. In sum, he did not make sufficient 
efforts to repay or resolve tax debts prior to 2008, and those actions were not adequate 
to fully resolve security concerns.         
 
  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    
 
 
10 
 
 
                                                          
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”11 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.
