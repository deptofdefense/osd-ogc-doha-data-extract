HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  
(e-QIP) on September 6, 2007. On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for 
Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On August 28, 2008, DOHA received Applicant’s Answer to the SOR and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed on September 29, 2008. The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2008. On 
October 14, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for October 
31, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered ten exhibits which 
were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 10. The Applicant testified. The record 
was held open until November 14, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional 
 
2 
 
 
documents. No documents were offered. The transcript was received on November 13, 
2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
 The Notice of Hearing was sent out less than fifteen days prior to the hearing. 
Applicant waived the fifteen day notice requirement. (Tr at 6.) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.e, 
1.x, 1.aa, and 1.bb, but denies all remaining allegations.  
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor 
seeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as an electrician with his 
company since August 2007. He has a high school education. He is married and has 
three children, ages 12, 9 and 3. He and his wife separated a few weeks prior to the 
hearing. (Tr at 4, 6-8, 59; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  
 
On March 15, 2007, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust 
Position (SF 85P) in relation to his job with a previous employer. He answered, “No,” in 
response to question “22(a) Your Financial Record. In the last 7 years, have you or a 
company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared 
bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had legal judgment rendered against you for a 
debt?” He also answered, “No,” in response to question “22(b) Your Financial Record. 
Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans 
or obligations funded or guaranteed by the federal government.” (Gov 2.) 
 
Applicant was hired by his current employer in August 2007. He completed an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing, (e-QIP) on September 6, 2007 
in order to apply for a security clearance. He answered “Yes” in response to question 
28(a) “In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” He 
listed a $1,200 debt related to a truck repossession in December 2006. He could not 
afford the payments so he surrendered the truck back to the company. He answered 
“No” in response to question 28(b) “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?” (Gov 2.)  
 
A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 on July 31, 1998. His debts were discharged on November 
25, 1998. (Gov 4; Gov 10 at 3.) Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 1998 because of issues 
with a truck that he purchased in 1996 for $27,000.  The truck had an extended 
warranty. In 1998, the truck had mechanical problems. The warranty company would 
not pay to the fix the truck. Applicant could not afford to make the loan payments and 
pay for the vehicle repairs, so he allowed the truck to be repossessed. He owed 
 
3 
 
 
approximately $17,000 on the loan for the truck. He filed for bankruptcy in order to clear 
up this account. Approximately $20,000 was discharged in his bankruptcy. (Tr at 51-54.)   
 
In August 2001, Applicant was charged with Deposit Account Fraud related to 
three bad checks written to a convenience store. The charges were dismissed in 
September 2001 after costs and restitution were paid. (Gov 5 at 3-4.) Applicant was 
charged with Deposit Account Fraud in July 2001 and August 2001 related to three bad 
checks written to a grocery store. The charges were dismissed in September 2001 after 
costs and restitution were paid. (Gov 5 at 2, 5, 6.)  
 
In March, May, August – November 2000, Applicant was taken to court for failure 
to pay monthly rent on his mobile home lot. In February – July 2001 and September 
2001, he was taken to court for failure to pay monthly rent. He paid the rent after a 
judgment was entered.  The debts are resolved. (Gov 6; Gov 10 at 3.) 
 
On August 10, 2007, a $2,449 judgment was entered against Applicant on behalf 
of a credit company for a deficiency balance on an automobile loan. On December 14, 
2007, a garnishment was filed against Applicant. On May 19, 2008, the judgment was 
satisfied through wage garnishment. Applicant’s wages were garnished $300 each pay 
check or $600 a month. (Gov 7; Gov 8 at 3; Gov 9 at 12.) 
 
Applicant owes the following  delinquent accounts:  a $416 cell phone account 
placed for collection in February 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 8 at 1; Gov 10 at 4); a $194 cell 
phone account placed for collection in November 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 10 at 8); a 
$625 credit card account placed for collection in March 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 8 at 2; 
Gov 9 at 8; Gov 10 at 4); a $903 furniture rental account placed for collection in 
February 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 9 at 4; Gov 10 at 4); a $412 utility account 
placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 8 at 3); and a $1,145 account placed 
for collection in January 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 8 at 3).  
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $210 medical account placed for collection 
in September 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 8); a $100 medical account 
placed for collection in April 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 10 at 9); a $51 medical account 
placed for collection in January 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 10); a $420 
medical account placed for collection in December 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.p: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 
10 at 6); a $185 medical account placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.q: Gov 
8 at 2); and a $166 medical account placed for collection in September 2003 (SOR ¶ 
1.r: Gov 10 at 8). 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $229 medical account placed for collection 
in June 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.s: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 7); a $112 medical account placed for 
collection in September 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.t: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 9); a $180 medical 
account placed for collection in August 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.u: Gov 9 at 7; Gov 10 at 8); a 
$544 medical account placed for collection in February 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.v: Gov 8 at 1; 
Gov 9 at 9; Gov 10 at 6); a $301 medical account placed for collection in October 2006      
 
4 
 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.w: Gov 9 at 9); and a $120 debt owed to a city placed for collection in May 
2009 (SOR ¶ 1.x: Gov 10 at 9). 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $2,674 medical account placed for 
collection in April 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.y: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 5); a $300 medical account 
placed for collection in March 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.z: Gov 8 at 2; Gov 10 at 7); a $242 water 
bill placed for collection in October 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.aa: Gov 9 at 12; Gov 10 at 7); a $50 
medical account placed for collection in January 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.bb: Gov 10 at 10); a 
$329 telephone account placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.cc: Gov 9 at 12; 
Gov 10 at 6); a $180 medical account placed for collection in February 2008 (SOR ¶ 
1.dd: Gov 8 at 2); and an $85 medical account placed for collection in March 2007       
(SOR ¶ 1.ee: Gov 8 at 2). 
 
From 1994 to 2000, Applicant worked for a company as a shipping clerk. He 
earned $13.50 an hour in 2000. His company was bought out by another company and 
the plant closed. Applicant found work but the pay was only $7 per hour. He worked a 
couple of weeks then got a job as an electrician’s helper. In 2001, he entered into an 
apprenticeship with a union eventually earning a journeyman card. It was a five year 
program.  Since he was starting out, the pay was not as high as his shipping clerk’s job. 
(Tr at 55 – 57, 84-85.)  
 
For the past five years, Applicant has been the sole provider for his family. His 
income was not sufficient to pay all of the bills. His wife is physically capable of working 
but after paying child care expenses, there would be little extra income added to the 
family if she was employed. (Tr at 25, 59-60, 80-82.) Applicant states there is nothing in 
the world that would make him jeopardize his country. (Tr at 15.)  
 
Applicant states that he did not intentionally falsify his trustworthiness application 
or his security clearance questionnaire. He had difficulty understanding both forms 
when he completed the application. He was not aware of the extent of his delinquent 
accounts until he was served interrogatories pertaining to his delinquent accounts. In 
hindsight, he admits that he should have answered “yes” to the question pertaining to 
having debts that were over 180 days old. (Tr at 27, 29, 33-34, 46-47.) 
 
Applicant claims that the telephone debt alleged in SOR ¶1.cc is paid. His phone 
service is back on. (Tr at 49.) The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.m – 1.w, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, 
1.dd, and 1.ee are all medical accounts. Applicant has worked for numerous employers 
over the past eight years. Some of his employers did not provide health insurance. Most 
of the medical bills related to routine medical bills of Applicant’s family. The $2,674 
medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.y were medical expenses incurred by Applicant from a 
2006 car accident. The medical bill was for an ambulance ride and hospital treatment. 
He was determined to be at fault in the accident. (Tr at 61-63.) 
 
The record evidence indicates the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e 
have been resolved.  There is no record evidence indicating the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.f – 1.ee are resolved.  Applicant states the garnishment which resolved the debt 
 
5 
 
 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e resulted in his getting behind on other bills. His phone is currently 
turned off because he could not pay the phone bill. He ended up selling two vehicles. 
(Tr at 86-87.) He intends to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy but had not done so at the 
close of the record. (Tr at 27.)  
 
Applicant has not attended financial counseling. He is current on federal and 
state income taxes. He recently received a raise. He earns $22.61 an hour. (Tr at 82-
83.) His net monthly take home pay without overtime is approximately $3,000. His rent 
is $750. Other monthly expenses include groceries and clothes $500 to $600; $720 car 
expenses including insurance (a 2005 small SUV and a 2002 motorcycle); $230 medical 
insurance; children’s medical insurance $66; and utilities $300. His total monthly 
expenses are approximately $2,566. If this amount is accurate, Applicant has 
approximately $434 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 67-72; Gov 3 at 5.)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
 
6 
 
 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant has encountered financial 
difficulty since 1998 when he filed for bankruptcy. From 2000 to 2001, he wrote several 
bad checks and struggled to meet his rent payments. He recently paid off (through 
garnishment) a $2,449 judgment entered against him in May 2008 related to an 
automobile repossession. He currently has 23 unresolved delinquent accounts with the 
total approximate balance of $10,173.  Applicant’s financial condition is such that he is 
unwilling or unable to resolve these accounts.   
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has a long history of financial problems. He received a fresh start as a result 
of his bankruptcy discharge in 1998 but continues to incur delinquent accounts. The 
 
7 
 
 
majority of Applicant’s debts remain delinquent and he has no definite plan in place to 
resolve these accounts. He continues to have significant financial problems.    
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. In 2000, Applicant was laid 
off from a job that he held for six years. The next job he found reduced his pay by half of 
what he was making at his previous job. His financial situation is further aggravated by 
he and his wife’s recent separation. I give this mitigating condition less weight because 
Applicant has not established a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts.   
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. While most of 
his delinquent accounts have relatively low balances, he has taken no action to pay off 
any of the accounts, which indicates that his financial situation is not under control. 
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Although the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 
1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are resolved, Applicant did not pay these debts until after he was taken 
to court. He has not developed a plan to resolve his 23 remaining delinquent accounts. 
While Applicant testified at hearing that he intends to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he 
had not done so at the close of the record. Even if he had filed for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, it would be too soon to conclude that his financial situation is stable.  
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG &15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 Personal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list several 
financial delinquencies on his security clearance questionnaires. Specifically, he failed 
to list his delinquent debts that were over 90 or 180 days old in response to sections 
28(a) and 28(b) on his security questionnaire (e-QIP) dated September 6, 2007. He also 
did not list the legal judgments obtained against him for unpaid rent (SOR ¶ 1.d) in 
response to section 22(a) on his questionnaire for public trust position. He did not list his 
 
8 
 
 
delinquent debts that were over 180 days old on the same questionnaire for public trust 
position in response to section 22(b). 
 
  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) ¶ 16(a) (deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in 
Applicant’s case. For PC DC ¶ 16(a) to apply, Applicant’s omission of his judgments and 
delinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant 
did not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance questionnaires. Applicant 
claims that he did not remember all of his financial delinquencies. He did not obtain a 
copy of his credit report until he received some interrogatories which listed his 
delinquent accounts. I find his explanation credible. During the hearing, Applicant 
admitted that he was somewhat confused about the security clearance application.  
 
 The personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  
    
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has 
resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.e.  However, Applicant has had additional 
delinquent accounts for several years and has no plan for resolving the accounts. While 
Applicant’s recent marital separation further complicates matters, he took no steps such 
as financial counseling to develop of plan for resolving these accounts prior to his 
separation. His financial problems remain. At this point, Applicant did not mitigate the 
concerns raised under financial considerations. Personal conduct concerns are 
mitigated because Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance questionnaire 
and application for a public trust position by omitting his delinquent debts.

Conclusion

clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
