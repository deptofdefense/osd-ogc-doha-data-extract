HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged three delinquent mortgage debts 
on real estate properties and a delinquent condominium fee, totaling $484,137. One 
debt was paid during the foreclosure process. He now has about $144,000 in delinquent 
SOR debt. The allegation that he deliberately falsified his security clearance application 
is not substantiated. Applicant mitigated personal conduct security concerns; however, 
he failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 18, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive 
 
1Government Exhibit (GE) 8 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 23, 2008). GE 8 is the 
source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise.

Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal 
Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On August 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested 
a hearing (GE 10).2 On September 16, 2008, DOHA amended the SOR adding an 
allegation that his condominium fee was delinquent in the amount of $2,450 (GE 10, 
SOR ¶ 1.d). On October 21, 2008, Applicant responded to the amended SOR (GE 10). 
On October 16, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held on November 
25, 2008, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GEs 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), 
and after the hearing Applicant offered one exhibit (Applicant’s Exhibit (AE A). There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted two Hearing 
Notices (GE 13, 14), the SOR (GE 8), Applicant’s response to the SOR (GE 9), and two 
documents pertaining to Applicant’s potential representation by counsel and waiver of 
his hearing (GE 11, 12). At the hearing, I agreed to hold the record open until December 
5, 2008, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 53, 60). I received 
the transcript on December 4, 2008. I received additional documentation from Applicant 
on December 5, 2008 (AE A).  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a to 1.c (GE 8, 9) with explanations for how the debts became delinquent. He denied 
knowingly and deliberately falsifying his September 18, 2007, SF 86 (GE 8, 9). His 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.    
 
Applicant is a 23-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.4 He 
graduated from high school in 2003 and completed one year of college (Tr. 5).  
 
2Applicant’s counsel waived Applicant’s hearing on November 24, 2008 (AE A); however, 
Department Counsel then requested a hearing (Tr. 14; AE A). 
 
3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.    
  
4GE 1 (2007 security clearance application) and/or GE 9 (SOR response) are the source or 
sources for the facts in the Statement of Facts section, unless stated otherwise.

Applicant is not married (Tr. 6). He has two children, who are ages five and three (Tr. 6). 
His third child is due in April 2009 (Tr. 6). He lives with his domestic partner, Ms. B (Tr. 
49, GE 1).

condominium fee, totaling $484,137. Their current status is summarized in the table

On March 15, 2006, Applicant and Ms. B, purchased a residential property (CR) 
and took a mortgage with Y, No. 5636XXXX for $224,000 with $1,323 monthly 
payments (GE 7 at 27, 28). The last payment was made in May 2007 (GE 7 at 29-39). 
In July 2005, they borrowed $56,000 on CR, Account No. 730364XXXX  (GE 7 at 4, 40).  
The last payment was made in May 2007 (GE 7 at 40-42). The delinquent account for 
$224,000 was not listed on the SOR (Tr. 48-49); however, the delinquent 2nd trust for 
about $56,000 was listed on the SOR (GE 9). Applicant disclosed both delinquent 
accounts in response to interrogatories (GE 7 at 1). He thought the lender received 
about $170,000 from the auction, leaving about a $100,000 loss (Tr. 39). Applicant did 
not contact the creditors after the foreclosure about making payment arrangements (Tr. 
46-47). 
 
Applicant’s real estate loans relating to CR were in good standing for two years 
as they used the CR property as their primary residence. Then Applicant and Ms. B 
moved and rented the CR property. The rent they received was supposed to be 
sufficient to pay CR’s mortgages. Applicant’s tenant failed to pay the rent, and Applicant 
and Ms. B evicted their tenant. Applicant and Ms. B obtained a judgment against the 
tenant for two months’ overdue rent. However, the tenant did not pay the judgment. 
Applicant’s January 27, 2008, credit report showed the past due amount as $2,540 on 
the $57,863 mortgage (GE 3).        
 
Applicant and Ms. B purchased an investment, residential property (FF) because 
their real estate agent convinced them they could resell the property in a few months 
and realize a profit (Tr. 35, GE 7 at 8, GE 9 at 1). On September 27, 2006, they 
borrowed $335,000 from “A,” Acct No. 00336XXXX to finance the property (GE 7 at 4, 
 
 
4 
 
                                           
44). They made their last payment in May 2007 (GE 7 at 44). Monthly payments were 
$2,299 (GE 7 at 44). On November 6, 2007, the lender foreclosed on FF (GE 7 at 4). 
Applicant believed the sale completely repaid the first mortgage, but did not pay any of   
the second mortgage (Tr. 38-39, 49).  
 
On January 1, 2007, they borrowed $83,654 with the FF property5 as collateral 
from H, Account No. 730621XXXX and monthly payments of $690 (GE 1, GE 7 at 4, 46, 
GE 9). Applicant’s January 27, 2008, credit report showed the past due amount as 
$5,191 on the $88,824 mortgage (GE 3). Applicant has not contacted the creditor after 
the November 6, 2007, foreclosure about making payment arrangements (Tr. 46-47). 
 
On March 5, 2007, Applicant became unemployed (Tr. 25) and his girlfriend 
assumed responsibility for payment of their mortgages (GE 7 at 3, GE 9 at 2). He was 
hired at a real estate firm on May 22, 2007, to assist with information technology (Tr. 25, 
GE 7 at 3). Ms. B became unemployed in June 2007 (Tr. 26, GE 7 at 3). On August 27, 
2007, Ms. B was hired (Tr. 26). In September 2007, Applicant began working for a 
defense contractor (Tr. 27, GE 7 at 3).    
 
On June 19, 2008, a creditor obtained a judgment for $2,450 for a condominium 
fee (GE 5). On September 16, 2008, Applicant said he intended to pay this debt (GE 10 
at 2). As of his hearing date on November 25, 2008, he had not contacted the creditor 
or paid anything towards this debt (Tr. 42-44). 
 
Applicant has two mortgages with C on his present residence, one for $110,448 
with a monthly payment of $844 and the other for $443,874 with a monthly payment of 
$2,316 (GE 7 at 19-20).  As of February 2008, these two mortgages were current (Tr. 
24, 36-37, GE 7 at 19-20). 
 
Personal Conduct (Guideline E) 
    
 Applicant completed his SF86 on September 18, 2007. He disclosed two types of 
derogatory information. He admitted that he left two jobs under adverse circumstances 
(GE 1 at Section 22). He also disclosed that he used marijuana five times from February 
2003 to August 2004 (GE 1 at Section 24). In response to Section 28 he answered, “No” 
on his SF 86 to two questions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant 
falsified his SF 86, “Your Financial Delinquencies-90 Days Are you currently over 90 
days delinquent on any debt(s)?”  
 
Applicant denied knowing his mortgage accounts were delinquent when he 
completed his SF 86 (Tr. 20, 22-23). Ms. B was responsible for making sure all debts 
and accounts were paid and current (Tr. 23). Ms. B worked with the real estate agent 
who handled the renter and the resale of the FF property (Tr. 30). She was making 
 
5 Applicant’s SOR response and hearing statement indicates this loan used the CR property as 
collateral; however, I conclude that the FF property was the collateral for this loan. Compare Tr. 29 and 
GE 9 at 1 with GE 7 at 4, 46 (account statement). 
 
 
5 
 
$12,000 to $15,000 in the mortgage business (Tr. 31). She worked in the mortgage 
business for seven years and Applicant trusted her judgment and expertise (Tr. 36). Ms. 
B told him their accounts were fine and all caught up or current (Tr. 21, 31-32). She 
became angry if he was too inquisitive about the status of their investments (Tr. 32). 
She is very secretive about the status of their bills (Tr. 34). Ms. B is the primary name 
on the delinquent accounts (Tr. 21). She maintains a separate account with her funds 
(Tr. 32-33). There was silence between them about their debts and their relationship 
became strained (Tr. 50). He first learned about the financial problems in October 2007, 
when he heard from his mortgage holder on his residence (Tr. 20). Immediately after 
discovering the accounts were delinquent, he disclosed the delinquency to his employer 
(Tr. 21-22). However, he could not remember the name of the person he told about his 
debt problem (Tr. 38). His employer advised him to wait until the Department of Defense 
contacted him about his debts (Tr. 22).  He had a full discussion with Ms. B about the 
debts when he received the DOHA interrogatories in March 2008 (Tr. 50-51, GE 7)  
 
Ms. B provided a statement indicating when they owned three residences she 
earned $10,000 to $15,000 monthly and Applicant earned about $2,200 (AE A at 1). Her 
expertise was in mortgage lending, and she was responsible for paying the mortgages 
(AE A at 1). When Applicant was out of work in 2007, there was little communication 
between Ms. B and Applicant because Applicant was depressed and moody (AE A at 
1). When he started his new employment, she still did not tell him about the delinquent 
debts because she did not want to upset him (AE A at 2). She lied to Applicant 
repeatedly about the status of their debts and always reassured him that their 
investments were doing fine (AE A at 2). After Applicant was already working for a 
government contractor she told him about the delinquent mortgages (AE A at 2-3).  
  
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at 
527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 
6 
 
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
 
7 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.”  
 
Applicant’s three delinquent debts are well documented. Three of the large debts 
listed in the statement of reasons are not paid or in payment plans. They total 
approximately $148,000 and are currently delinquent. They became delinquent in 2007, 
which is too recent to constitute a lengthy history of delinquent debt and AG ¶ 19(a) 
does not apply. He has provided insufficient documentation to show progress resolving 
these three debts. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶ 
19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
 
8 
 
                                           
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 19(b) because three conditions 
causing financial problems were largely beyond his control. First, his difficult relationship 
with Ms. B in connection with their finances caused problems. Ms. B’s lack of 
communication about their finances as well as her control of their investments and debt 
payments made it difficult for Applicant to intervene when their financial problems became 
worse. Second, both Applicant and his wife were briefly unemployed in 2007. Third, the 
widespread deflation in residential real estate has caused many investors to lose money 
and generated substantial delinquent debt. He does not receive full credit because he did 
not act responsibly under the circumstances. After he and Ms. B’s returned to full 
employment, they had the means to address their delinquent debt. He did not 
communicate with his creditors, attempt to arrange a payment plan, or file for bankruptcy. 
All three debts remain as delinquent and unresolved as they were when Applicant was 
notified of their security significance upon the receipt of the SOR.   
 
Applicant did not provide evidence of financial counseling and he did not dispute 
the SOR debts. AG ¶¶ 19(c) and 19(e) do not apply. 
 
Applicant did not establish that he made a good faith effort to repay the three 
delinquent debts, or otherwise attempt to resolve them to a sufficient degree to mitigate 
them. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith6 in 
the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts because he did not establish that his failure to 
pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and 1.d was reasonable and necessary under the 
circumstances. He did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his delinquent 
debts especially those debts which accrued after being notified they were a security 
concern when the SOR was delivered to him.7  
 
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
 
 
9 
 
 
Applicant’s financial problems are continuing and likely to recur. He should have 
been more diligent, providing documentation showing greater, more timely efforts to 
resolve his three delinquent debts. He has not carried his burden of proving his financial 
responsibility. There are not clear indications his three delinquent debts are being 
resolved. His overall conduct with these creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment, and I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. 
 
Personal Conduct (Guideline E) 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
Applicant’s September 18, 2007, SF 86 asked about Applicant’s delinquent debt. 
He answered, “No,” and did not disclose the debts discussed in the previous section. 
AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) apply. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
                                                                                                                                             
whether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
10 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
As indicated previously, Applicant’s answers about his delinquent debts were not 
deliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts. Ms. B concealed 
the delinquent debts from him and I find his denials of knowledge about these debts to 
be credible. He disclosed other derogatory information concerning terminations of 
employment and drug use. The allegations about providing a false answer about his 
currently delinquent debts are unsubstantiated and therefore mitigated under AG ¶ 
17(f). 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount 
concern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the “whole person” concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by 
the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other 
variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all 
relevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful 
analysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive ¶ E2.2.1:  
 
 
11 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E2.2.3, “The ultimate determination of whether the granting or 
continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful 
consideration” of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
There is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant’s conduct under the whole 
person concept. Applicant is 23 years old and is not sophisticated about his finances. 
He allowed his domestic partner, Ms. B, to handle their investments and pay their debts. 
He was unaware of his financial problems until after he signed his SF 86 and the two 
properties were already repossessed. Like thousands of other investors caught when 
the real estate bubble burst in 2007, he is not culpable for making what turned out to be 
in hindsight poor real estate investments. An important positive financial development is 
his mortgage on his own residence is current, and he is now communicating with his 
domestic partner about financial issues. His dedication to his work, his family and his 
country is a very positive indication of his good character and trustworthiness. He is 
completely loyal to the United States. There is no evidence of any security violation, or 
criminal activity. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid. These factors show 
some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative 
guidelines is not sufficient to warrant access to classified information at this time. He 
has not made any payments on the three delinquent SOR debts. The overall amount of 
unresolved delinquent SOR debt is about $144,000, which is substantial. About 
$142,000 of this debt resulted from foreclosures of two properties in 2007. His financial 
irresponsibility is shown by his failure to contact his creditors after the mortgages were 
foreclosed about making payment plans. He and Ms. B have the income to enter into 
payment plans on at least one debt, had ample time to begin payment plans and 
establish a track record of responsibility on these debts and yet have chosen not to take 
these steps. In sum, he failed to establish that he acted financially responsibly after he 
became fully employed and received the SOR with respect to his delinquent debts.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”8 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
                                            
8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).

Process, all the evidence in this decision and my interpretation of my responsibilities 
under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  Against Applicant 
  
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
