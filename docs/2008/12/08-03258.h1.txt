HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged five delinquent debts, totaling 
about $45,000. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt, and her proven delinquent 
SOR debt actually totaled about $33,000. She did not make any payments for more 
than a year or otherwise establish any track record of debt resolution of these four 
delinquent SOR debts. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. Department Counsel withdrew the personal conduct allegation. Eligibility for a 
security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 10, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On September 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to her,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
 
1Government Exhibit (GE) 7 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated September 29, 2008). GE 7 is 
the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal 
Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On October 28, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and 
requested a hearing (GE 8). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on 
November 17, 2008, and on that same date the case was assigned to me. At the 
hearing held on December 11, 2008, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-
5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Applicant’s Exhibit (AE A-
C) (Tr. 34). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A (Tr. 18, 34-35). 
Additionally, I admitted a Hearing Notice (GE 6), the SOR (GE 7), and Applicant’s 
response to the SOR (GE 8). I received the transcript on December 19, 2008.   
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that on July 20, 2008, Applicant indicated in a letter that she 
was abandoning her attempt to obtain a security clearance because security clearance 
judgments are unfair and discriminatory against the working people of the United 
States. Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw this allegation, the Applicant 
did not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 13). This allegation will not receive further 
discussion in this decision. 
 
 The SOR and the SOR response contain five identical subparagraphs under 
paragraph 1, except the SOR subparagraphs are incorrectly numbered in the SOR 
response (GE 7, 8). The SOR response lacks any subparagraph 1.d and there is a 
subparagraph 1.f (GE 8). I changed SOR ¶ 1.e to 1.d and SOR ¶ 1.f to 1.e and initialed 
the changes in the SOR response (GE 8). 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the five SOR 
delinquent debts totaling about $45,000 (GE 8). Her admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I 
make the following findings of fact.    
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5, 19).3 She 
married her spouse in 1983; however, she does not have any children (Tr. 19; GE 1). 
Applicant earned a high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree (Tr. 6; AE B). 
She is currently enrolled in college and is pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree (Tr. 6; AE 
C). She has completed nine courses towards her bachelor’s degree and has a 3.8 GPA 
(Tr. 20). She has focused her classes on geometrics, which involves geography, 
information systems and using remote sense data to prepare maps for the national 
geospatial industry (Tr. 20). She is taking courses to improve her employability and 
increase her income (Tr. 20). A subcontractor to her current employer provided her 
employment from late 2003 to 2005 (Tr. 28). She has never served in the military (GE 
1). A government contractor has employed her in the geospatial area since 2005 (Tr. 
21, 28). Her security application did not disclose a police record or a felony conviction. 
Her record has no indication of illegal drug abuse or mental disability or instability. She 
has never left employment under adverse circumstances. When she completed her 
2007 SF 86, she disclosed the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e and several non-
SOR delinquent debts. On September 10, 2007, she promised to rectify her debts and 
pay monies owed to her creditors (GE 1).  
  
Applicant admitted responsibility for all five delinquent SOR debts, totaling about 
$45,000. Her last contact with the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e was in 2005 
(Tr. 24-25). Her last contact with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d was in November 2007 (Tr. 
24-25). She does not have any debts in addition to those listed on the SOR (Tr. 33). 
Their current status is summarized in the table below: 
 
SOR PARAGRAPH AND 
TYPE OF DEBT 
AMOUNT STATUS 
¶ 1.a Credit Card or 
Signature Loan 
$9,492 Delinquent debt since 2005 (Tr. 24) 
¶ 1.b Credit Card or 
Signature Loan 
$13,180 Delinquent debt since 2005 (Tr. 24). 
¶ 1.c Credit Card or 
Signature Load 
$11,208 Duplication of SOR ¶ 1.b (Tr. 24) 
¶ 1.d Credit Card or 
Signature Loan 
$9,470 Delinquent debt-made payments until 
November 2007 (Tr. 23). 
¶ 1.e Car Loan 
 
$1,716 Her vehicle was repossessed in 2004 and 
after the sale, she still owed $1,716. This 
debt has been delinquent since 2005 (Tr. 
24, 35-36)  
Total $33,858 (excluding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c)  
 
Applicant was unemployed from August 2001 until July 2002 because her family 
moved to a different state (Tr. 26-27, 29; GE 1). Her first employment in a new state

stated otherwise.

was at a department store (Tr. 27). She has been steadily employed for the last six 
years (Tr. 27).  
 
Applicant’s husband was on active duty from 1983 to 2004 (Tr. 22). He retired as 
a Chief Master Sergeant (E-9) (Tr. 26). Applicant’s husband was living off of his military 
retirement and was not employed (Tr. 25). Applicant’s husband owns their residence, 
and Applicant pays him part of her income (Tr. 30). She is unaware of her husband’s 
financial status (Tr. 30). Around 1994, Applicant and her husband agreed to keep 
separate accounts and separate debts (Tr. 32). The SOR debts were solely Applicant’s 
debts (Tr. 32). Because Applicant was in a military family, there were frequent moves 
(Tr. 23). Applicant was unable to build seniority as an employee until her husband 
retired from the Air Force (Tr. 23). 
 
Applicant’s social security records for 1997 to 2007 show the following income:  
 
Year Income Year Income 
1997 $25,333 1998 $18,597 
1999 $10,841 2000 $19,442 
2001 $11,743 2002 $5,901 
2003 $14,335 2004 $13,833 
2005 $26,895 2006 $23,991 
2007 $29,663   
 
Applicant has one financial asset, her 401K account, which contains about 
$12,000 (Tr. 31). Recently her 1989 Toyota ceased operation for mechanical reasons, 
and she has not decided whether to try to have it repaired (Tr. 31).  
 
Applicant did not disclose financial counseling. Applicant’s plan to resolve her 
delinquent debts was to wait until the economy stabilized; then she intends to borrow 
enough money to pay her debts (Tr. 25). She insisted that she wanted to pay all of her 
debts (Tr. 25).   
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at 
527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
 
 
6 
 
above, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
.  .  .  . SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in her credit report, her 2007 security clearance 
application and her SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleged five delinquent debts, 
totaling about $45,000. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt, and her actual 
delinquent debt load is about $33,000. She admitted responsibility for the four 
delinquent debts. She did not make any payments for more than a year or otherwise 
establish any track record of debt resolution of these four SOR debts. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). “Once a concern 
arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong 
presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial considerations security 
concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating 
conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15.       
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. Her 
financial problems are not isolated because she currently has four delinquent debts 
totaling about $33,000. The ongoing nature of her delinquent debts is “a continuing 
course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-
11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 
2002)). Moreover, I am not convinced her debts “occurred under such circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Although she has been paying some of her non-
SOR debts, she has failed to pay anything towards her SOR debts even though she has 
been steadily employed for more than four years.   
 
Under AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant’s unemployment from August 2001 to July 2002 
resulted in multiple debts. As such, some of her debts are due to forces beyond her 
control. However, she did not provide sufficient information to establish that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address her 
delinquent debts, especially those debts which remained delinquent even though she 
has been steadily employed for at least four years.4 She admitted that she has not 
maintained contact with her SOR creditors, and made very limited efforts to pay the four 
delinquent SOR debts.     
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not disclose financial 
counseling. There are no indications that “that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control” because the amount of delinquent debt has been unchanged for more than a 
year. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith5 in 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                            
the resolution of her delinquent SOR debts because she did not establish that her 
failure to pay her delinquent debts was reasonable and necessary under the 
circumstances. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not dispute her responsibility 
for any debts. I conclude Applicant’s overall conduct in regard to her delinquent debts 
casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She failed to 
resolve or make payments to four creditors to whom she owed substantial debts. She 
promised to pay two of her SOR creditors in her 2007 SF 86, and did not do so. She did 
not provide good cause for her failure to set up payment plans and make some 
payments despite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my evaluation of the record 
evidence as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not mitigated.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).   
There is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant’s conduct under the whole 
person concept. Her dedication to her work and her country is a very positive indication 
of her good character and trustworthiness. She improved her employability and 
prospects for greater income through her continuing education efforts. Her 3.8 grade 
 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
9 
 
point average is particularly impressive. She is completely loyal to her country. 
Applicant’s record of good employment and law-abiding character weigh in her favor. 
There is no evidence of any security violation, or criminal activity. Her non-SOR debts 
are current and being paid. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation.  
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative 
guidelines are not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. The overall 
amount of unresolved debt is about $33,000 and substantial. She has been 
continuously employed for more than four years (with income ranging from $23,991 to 
$29,663 for the period 2005 to 2007), and did not establish that she lacked the funds to 
arrange and begin payment plans. She promised to pay two SOR debts in 2007 on her 
security clearance application and failed to fulfill her promise. Applicant has been aware 
of the security significance of her delinquent SOR debts since she received the SOR in 
October 2008, and she did not take any material actions to resolve her delinquent 
debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns.      
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    WITHDRAWN 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Withdrawn 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
