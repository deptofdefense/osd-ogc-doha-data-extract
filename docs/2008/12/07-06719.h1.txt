Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant mitigated the security concern that arose from the delinquent accounts
listed in his credit bureau reports. 
On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on July 28, 2008, denied
all SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without a
hearing.  On August 29, 2008, Department Counsel, pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the
Additional Procedural Guidance at Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6, requested a
hearing. Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I

The case was assigned to me on September 17, 2008. A notice of hearing was
issued on October 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 22, 2008. The hearing was
conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection.
Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary exhibits. The record was held open
to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. Nine
documents were timely received, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-9 and admitted into
the record without objection. Department Counsel’s forwarding memorandum was marked
as App. Ex. II and is included in the file. The transcript was received on November 6, 2008.
   
Findings of Fact
After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is 48 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979 and has been
employed as a machine repairman by a defense contractor since 1981. He was laid off by
this defense contractor from June 2003 to December 2004, during which time he supported
himself from his savings. He has never held a security clearance. 
Applicant was married in November 1981. The marriage ended by divorce in either
March 1998 or March 1999. He has two daughters from the marriage, ages 20 and 26.
Until recently, the younger daughter resided with him and was primarily supported by him.
The SOR lists 16 accounts that have either been charged off as bad debts or
submitted for collection. The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a is a medical account
owing in the amount of $150 with a listed date of last activity of June 2006. (GE 5)
Applicant does not recognize this account but acknowledges it may be a charge for
medical care received by his daughter that should have been paid by his ex-wife but was
not. (Tr. pp. 37-39) He credibly testified he will pay this debt if he gets a bill from the
creditor and his ex-wife doesn’t pay it. (Tr. p. 40)
The last activity on the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f and 1.h
through 1.k occurred between December 2000 and November 2001. The last activity for
the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g, 1.l and 1.m occurred in December 2003,
November 2002, and September 2004, respectively. A review of Applicant’s credit reports
indicates the last activity on the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g, 1.l and 1.m  were
dates when the accounts were purchased by a collection agency. Applicant denies he is
responsible for any of these debts. 
Applicant began dating a woman in or about April 2000, and allowed her to move
into his home in or about November 2000. Almost immediately thereafter, she stole his
vehicle and credit cards. He filed a police report on November 8, 2000, in which he
identified the woman and reported the theft of the credit cards. (AE 5 & AE 6) Analysis of
the dates of last activity on the accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.m and
the date Applicant reported the theft of his credit cards strongly corroborates his assertion

that the woman used the stolen credit cards extensively in addition to possibly opening
other accounts using his name. 
Applicant initially made payment on some of the accounts until he realized the
extent of her thievery. He also disputed some of the accounts with credit reporting services.
When creditors began to aggressively pursue him, he contacted an attorney. He was
advised to make no further payments on the accounts and not to respond or discuss the
accounts with any creditor who might try to contact him. (Tr. pp. 42-43 and p. 64) Law suits
have been filed against him by creditors on three occasions. On each occasion, his
attorney has gotten the suits dismissed. (AE 4 and AE 7-9)
Applicant has not used a credit card since about the time his credit cards were
stolen in 2000. Instead, he either pays cash or uses a debit card attached to his checking
account. He earns approximately $70,000 a year, lives within his means, and owns a
house valued at about $170,000, in which he has approximately $110,000 in equity. 
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial
considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this
case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the5
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to6
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against

him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant is likely jointly responsible with his ex-wife for the $150 medical debt listed
in SOR subparagraph 1.a. He credibly testified he will pay the debt when and if he receives
a bill his ex-wife does not pay. His testimony, the information contained in his credit
reports, the police report he filed, and the court records he submitted clearly establish the
remaining debts resulted from the theft of his credit cards in or about November 2000. He
currently lives within his income and has not relied upon revolving credit since his credit
cards were stolen. No disqualifying condition applies. 
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, including Applicant’s appearance and demeanor while testifying,
the corroborating evidence he submitted, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the
Directive, and the lack of any disqualifying condition, I find Applicant has mitigated the
5
financial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and
satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a-m: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is granted.
