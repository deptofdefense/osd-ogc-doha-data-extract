HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged 17 delinquent debts, totaling 
about $168,000. His first and second mortgagees were listed on the SOR and totaled 
about $133,000. They went to foreclosure; however, results of the foreclosure sale are 
unknown. One SOR debt duplicated another SOR debt. Fourteen delinquent debts are 
not resolved (total: about $25,000). He did not make any payments on these 14 
delinquent debts for more than a year. Applicant failed to mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 19, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
 
1Government Exhibit (GE) 6 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 3, 2008). GE 6 is the 
source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise.

1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed 
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On October 28, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and 
requested a hearing (GE 8). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on 
November 17, 2008, and on that same date the case was assigned to me. At the 
hearing held on December 10, 2008,2 Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-
4) (Transcript (Tr.) 17), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 10). There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted a Hearing Notice (GE 
5), the SOR (GE 6), and Applicant’s response to the SOR (GE 7). I received the 
transcript on December 18, 2008.   
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the seventeen SOR 
delinquent debts totaling about $168,000 (GE 7). His admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of 
record, I make the following findings of fact.    
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee, who has been employed by a defense 
contractor since November 2007 (Tr. 6, 20). His work is in communications or public 
relations (Tr. 21). He has not had any unemployment since November 2007 (Tr. 36). 
Applicant earned a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts in 1997 (Tr. 6, 19, 34). He has a part-
time entertainment job drawing pictures two days a week in the evenings (Tr. 20). He 
does not currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 7). He is married with four children 
ages five, nine, eleven, and fourteen (Tr. 19). His wife has been a grade school teacher 
for the last three years (Tr. 21). He has not served in the military (GE 1).   
 
Applicant’s security application did not disclose a felony conviction (GE 1). His 
record has no indication of illegal drug abuse, mental disability or instability. He has 
never left employment under adverse circumstances. When he completed his 2008 SF 
86, he disclosed the foreclosure of his residence, a vehicle repossession and several 
 
2Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice of the date and location for his hearing (Tr. 13-15). 
 
3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

other delinquent SOR debts (GE 1). He received an Eagle Scout Award from the Boy 
Scouts (GE 1).  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for all 17 delinquent SOR debts, totaling about 
$168,000 (Tr. 22). He did not have arrangements with any of the creditors to pay his 
debts (Tr. 22). His most recent contact with any of the SOR creditors was when he 
communicated with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.l ($2,043) around April 2008, when he 
informed the creditor that he was releasing the vehicle to a junkyard (Tr. 23). His next 
most recent communication with a creditor occurred around January 2008, when he 
discussed repossession of the vehicle related to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($10,420) (Tr. 
23).  
 
The status of Applicant’s SOR debts is summarized in the table below:

Applicant planned to make arrangements with a financial advisor and debt 
consolidation company to resolve his financial problems (Tr. 24, 27). He hoped to pay 
off the small debts first, and then the larger ones (Tr. 24). He wants to pay and plans to 
pay his delinquent debts (Tr. 45). His financial counseling was at a preliminary stage, 
 
 
4 
 
involving completion of forms rather than assembling a budget and a specific plan of 
debt resolution (Tr. 28). In June 2007, Applicant learned about bankruptcy from a 
bankruptcy attorney (Tr. 26, 36-37). At that time, Applicant decided not to pay his debts 
because he planned to discharge them through bankruptcy (Tr. 37). However, he 
subsequently decided not to seek discharge of his debts through bankruptcy (Tr. 26, 36-
37). His problem with bankruptcy is paying the attorney and fees involved (Tr. 26-27).    
 
Applicant’s mortgage was foreclosed; however, he did not know the result of the 
foreclosure sale and had not learned whether he still owed any money or not on the 
mortgages (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g). In addition to the SOR debts, he owed $7,200 to a 
landlord (Tr. 29). The debt to his landlord was being resolved with a $20 per month 
payment plan (Tr. 30). His wife had two student loans, and the federal government kept 
“a lot of” his tax refund (Tr. 30).  
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to ignorance, procrastination, 
unemployment in 2001, and underemployment when he was a car salesman and pizza 
deliveryman (Tr. 31-33). He also noted the costs associated with caring for four children 
(Tr. 31, 32). In 2006, Applicant and his family moved to a different state where they now 
live to increase their income (Tr. 33, 35). Applicant’s residence in the state where he 
lived before 2006 went into foreclosure. 
 
Applicant rents his current resident for $1,430 per month (Tr. 37, 44). Applicant 
and his spouse own three vehicles: a 1997 Ford Taurus (received as a gift), a 1996 
Chevrolet Cavalier (currently no lien), and a 1997 Suburban (purchased in June 2008 
and it has a $280 monthly payment due on lien) (Tr. 38). He does not own any stocks 
and bonds or have a 401K at work (Tr. 38). He does not have any other significant 
financial assets (Tr. 39). 
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement indicates Applicant and his wife have 
total monthly net income of about $6,000, monthly expenses of about $3,500, and 
monthly debt payments of about $600 (Tr. 39). His net monthly remainder is about 
$1,900 (Tr. 39).   
 
A significant financial problem for Applicant is overdrafts on Applicant and his 
wife’s joint checking account (Tr. 40). He thought the average number of monthly 
overdrafts was about eight (Tr. 41); however, in October 2008 they had about 30 
overdrafts, resulting in bank costs of $36 per overdraft (Tr. 40-41). Applicant planned to 
make elimination of overdrafts a priority in his future financial plan (Tr. 40-41). 
 
Applicant did not have any evaluations from his employer (Tr. 42-43). However, 
he believed he would be described as dependable, responsible and a good worker (Tr. 
42-43).

Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at 
527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
 
 
6 
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
.  .  .  . SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his 2008 security clearance 
application, his SOR response, and at his hearing. Applicant’s SOR alleged 17 
delinquent debts, totaling about $168,000. His first and second mortgagees totaled 
about $133,000 and went to foreclosure. Results of the foreclosure sale are unknown. 
One debt was a duplication, leaving 14 delinquent debts, totaling abut $25,000. He did 
not establish any payments on these 14 delinquent debts for the year prior to his 
hearing, even though he and his wife were employed in their current jobs. He did not 
establish any track record of debt resolution of these 14 delinquent SOR debts. The 
government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). “Once a 
concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong 
presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial considerations security 
concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating 
conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15.       
 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. His 
financial problems are not isolated because he currently has 14 delinquent debts 
totaling about $25,000. The ongoing nature of his delinquent debts is “a continuing 
course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-
11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 
2002)). Moreover, I am not convinced his debts “occurred under such circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Although he has been paying some of his non-SOR 
debts, he has failed to establish payments towards his SOR debts even though he and 
his wife have been steadily employed for more than a year.   
 
Under AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant’s unemployment and underemployment contributed 
to his financial problems. As such, some of his debts are due to forces beyond his 
control. However, he did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his delinquent 
debts especially those debts which remained delinquent even though he has been 
steadily employed for at least year.4 He admitted that he has not maintained contact 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                            
with his SOR creditors, and made very limited efforts to pay the 14 delinquent SOR 
debts.     
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not complete financial 
counseling. There are no indications that “that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control” because the amount of delinquent debt has been unchanged for at least the last 
12 months. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good 
faith5 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts because he did not establish that his 
failure to pay his delinquent debts was reasonable and necessary under the 
circumstances. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not dispute his responsibility for 
any debts. I conclude Applicant’s overall conduct in regard to his delinquent debts casts 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed to resolve 
or make payments to 14 creditors to whom he owed a total of about $25,000. He did not 
provide good cause for his failure to set up payment plans and make some payments 
despite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence 
as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not mitigated.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).   
There is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant’s conduct under the whole 
person concept. His dedication to his work, his family and his country is a very positive 
indication of his good character and trustworthiness. He improved his employability and 
prospects for greater income through his move to the state of his current residence. His 
wife completed her education and has full-time teaching employment. Applicant has a 
part-time job in addition to his employment with the federal contractor to increase his 
income. He is completely loyal to his country. Applicant’s hard work, record of good 
employment and law-abiding character weigh in his favor. There is no evidence of any 
security violation. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid. These factors show 
some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative 
guidelines are not sufficient to warrant his access to classified information at this time. 
The overall amount of unresolved debt is about $25,000 and substantial. His mortgages 
will be a security concern in the future, if he still owes the creditors money. He and his 
spouse have been continuously employed for the last year. They have the funds to 
arrange and begin payment plans. One significant financial problem is they frequently 
overdraw their checking account and the resultant fees are an obviously avoidable 
expense. Applicant has been aware of the security significance of his delinquent SOR 
debts since he received the SOR in October 2008, and he did not take any material 
actions to resolve his delinquent debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.      
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
