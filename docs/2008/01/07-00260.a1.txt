APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On March 20, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
The Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline F.  That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.1
Decision at 3.2

and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 27, 2007, after the hearing,
Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding
Applicant’s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate;  whether the Judge was
unfair, or arbitrary and capricious.  Finding no error, we affirm.
(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his response to two questions on his
security clearance application by failing to disclose three debts totaling approximately $36,000 that
had been delinquent for more than 90 or 180 days.  Applicant’s argument in this regard does not
demonstrate that the Judge erred.
In this case, Applicant had initially offered multiple explanations for his failure to disclose
the delinquent debts, including not having enough time to review his answers, having problems with
the on-line account used to submit his security clearance application, and working in a high pressure
position.  At the end of cross-examination, he had admitted that he had not disclosed the information
in question because he was embarrassed about his financial problems.   The Judge reasonably2
considered Applicant’s explanations in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there
was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant’s omissions were deliberate and intentional.  On this
record, the Judge’s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.
 
(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge was unfair, essentially based upon the fact that the
Judge did not find Applicant’s favorable evidence sufficient to mitigate the government’s security
concerns.  In support of this contention, he argues that he has been granted a clearance on two prior
occasions without incident, and that he has received numerous awards for excellent service from
both the Navy and the Coast Guard.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.
There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking
to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at
4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was
unfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead
a reasonable person to question his fairness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.
19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings
or reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,
2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,
standing alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudice.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of persuasion, in
that he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable
person to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
3
No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).
The Board has previously noted that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a
presumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-
00318 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004); ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  Prior
security clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on
the legal sufficiency of the Judge’s adverse clearance decision here.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-
04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).  The government is not estopped from making an adverse
clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-
24506 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the
security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or
circumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App.
Bd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).
Likewise, the absence of prior security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security
clearance decision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles
classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See ISCR Case No.
05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007) citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir.
1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An applicant with good or exemplary job performance
may engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123
at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty
conduct and circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-
person analysis to determine an applicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not
confined to the workplace.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). 
Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the
applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and
mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the
particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light
of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).
Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable
security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and
decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An
applicant’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a
different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the
evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
The Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding
that the security concerns raised by Applicant’s falsifications had not been mitigated.  Although
Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge’s conclusions, he has not established that those
conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.3.
In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the
recency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of
relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He found in favor of the Applicant with
respect to the Guideline F allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which
the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government’s security

concerns under Guideline E.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable  evidence
cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).   Given the record
that was before him, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is
sustainable.
Order
The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
