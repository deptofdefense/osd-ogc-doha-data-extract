Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:
Applicant has mitigated the security concern that arose as the result of his multiple
Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings, the last of which occurred in 2003.  
On July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns
under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR,
dated September 5, 2007, in which he admitted all SOR allegations and provided various

explanations and clarifications to the allegations. Applicant requested a clearance decision
based on the written record without a hearing.  
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on
October 9, 2007, that was mailed to Applicant on October 11, 2007,and informed him he
had 30 days from receipt of the documents to submit his objections or information he
wished to be considered. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM or object to
anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned to
me on December 13, 2007.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 66-year-old man who has been employed by a defence contractor
since approximately 1985 with varying periods of unemployment during that time due to
layoffs. The security clearance applications contained in the FORM indicate Applicant
served in the Army from August 1961 until March 1970, and the Air Force from October
1970 until March 1982, although they indicate it was as an inactive reservist. However,
Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he is a Viet Nam veteran and in a statement
he provided he attributed his financial problems in 1984 to excessive debt he accumulated
while in the military. Whether from active duty or as a reservist, Applicant retired from the
Air Force in 1982.
Applicant has been married four times. The first marriage was from July 1960 until
April 1967. The second marriage was from approximately October 1967 until October
1994. The third marriage was from February 1995 until June 2004. Applicant has been
married to his current wife since August 2004. Applicant has six adult children.
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about October 1984. His
monthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was $1,621.93. His wife’s
monthly net income was $430.00. Their total monthly living expenses were $1,873.00.
Applicant listed outstanding debts in the amount of $4,521.04 in the bankruptcy petition.
In a statement he provided in May 2000, Applicant attributed his 1984 financial problems
to excessive debt due to over spending. Applicant successfully completed the plan and
obtained a discharge in March 1987. 
Applicant next filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 1989. His
monthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was $2,500.00. His wife’s
monthly net income was $842.00. Their total monthly living expenses were $2,712.00.
Applicant listed delinquent state and federal taxes in the total amount of $9,317,00,
mortgage payments in arrears in the amount of $7,348.00, and unsecured debts in the
amount of $1,727.00 in this bankruptcy petition. In a statement he provided in May 2000,
Applicant attributed his 1989 financial problems to being laid-off from work. The plan was
dismissed because Applicant did not have funds to make payments under the plan. 
3
Applicant again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in February 1996. His
monthly net income at that time, including military retired pay, was listed as $1,285.00.
Applicant, having listed his monthly retirement pay as $635.00 in the 1984 petition and as
$780.00 in the 1989 petition, only claimed $445.00 per month as retirement pay in the
1996 petition, likely because a portion of his retirement pay had been ordered paid to his
ex-wife. Applicant’s wife’s monthly net income was listed as $300.00. Their total income
from employment was listed as $36,000 in 1994 and only $4,000 in 1995. Applicant also
claimed as income of $195 per week from unemployment but did not list anything for
retired pay. Their total monthly living expenses were $1,245.00. Applicant listed delinquent
state and federal taxes in the total amount of $43,628,00, secured claims in the amount
of $2,398.25, and unsecured debts in the amount of $41,681.00, excluding $30,000.00 that
is included in the delinquent taxes noted above in this bankruptcy petition. 
In the statement he provided in May 2000, Applicant attributed his 1996 financial
problems to a number of factors, including his 1994 divorce and the resulting child support
and alimony he was required to pay, being laid-off from work from January 1995 to January
1997, and past debts incurred during earlier lay-offs. Applicant successfully completed the
plan on this bankruptcy and obtained a discharge in August 2000.
Applicant once more filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in or about
November 2003. The pleadings for this bankruptcy are not included in the FORM.
However, Applicant was interviewed in July 2006, at which time he stated his net monthly
income, including retired pay, was $3,400, and his net monthly expenses were $2,346. His
wife did not have any income. Applicant also provided a personal financial statement in
March 2007, in which he listed his net monthly income as $6,323 (the documents he
provided in response to interrogatories in March 2007, indicate his net monthly income is
actually about $5,100), and his net monthly expenses as $2,272. Again his wife is not listed
as having any income. The significant increase in income, whether as he listed in his
financial statement or as reflected in the documents he provided, is apparently due to
Applicant receiving social security payments in the amount of $1,538.00 beginning in
January 2007.
Applicant listed unsecured claims in the amount of $16,626.27, priority claims in the
amount of $2,635, and secured claims in the amount of $20,545.09 in the 2003
bankruptcy. Amounts ranging from the current $141 to as high as $292 have been
garnished from Applicant’s pay every week since October 1, 2003, to make the payments
required under the plan. During the July 2006 interview, Applicant attributed his need to file
for bankruptcy protection in 2003 to a strike being called by his labor union in either late
2001 or early 2002, the resulting loss of income, and the divorce he was going through in
2002. Applicant estimated at that time that he would complete the scheduled payments
under the plan in or about June 2007.
Applicant’s credit reports, dated November 2005 and January 2007, indicate
Applicant had two tax liens that were either released and/or paid in September 2000.
Further, most, if not all, accounts listed in those credit reports were included in the 2003
bankruptcy.

Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying
Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,
each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the
factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence
of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial
considerations), with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,4
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the5
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to6
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to10
classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11

Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Applicant found it necessary to seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection on four
occasions. The bankruptcy petitions filed in 1984, 1996 and 2003 were approved and
repayment plans ordered. The petition filed in 1996 was dismissed because Applicant
lacked income with which to make payments under any plan that could have been
approved. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
DC 19©: a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.
Applicant candidly admitted that the 1984 bankruptcy resulted from he and his wife
spending excessively while he was in the military. Applicant made all payments required
under the plan that was ordered in this bankruptcy and obtained a discharge in March
1987.
Applicant attributed the 1989 bankruptcy to being laid off from work. Items 9 and 13
of the FORM substantiate that Applicant and his wife earned $38,560 in 1988, and that his
employment with a defense contractor was terminated on December 2, 1988. His verified
answer to questions 2a, 2c and 2d in the bankruptcy petition he executed on September
30, 1989 (Item 9) indicate he was unemployed for most if not all of the time between
December 1988 and September 1989. Applicant’s debts listed in this bankruptcy consisted
of delinquent state and federal taxes, $1,727 of unsecured debt, and delinquent mortgage
payments that appear to coincide with the period of his unemployment.
Applicant attributed his 1996 financial problems to a number of factors, including his
1994 divorce and the resulting child support and alimony he was required to pay, being
laid-off from work from January 1995 to January 1997, and past debts incurred during
earlier lay-offs. Again, Applicant’s verified answers to questions posed to him in the
bankruptcy petition substantiate his claim of unemployment with his income from
employment falling from $32,000 in 1994, to $0.00 in 1995, and $864 through the first two
months of 1996. Applicant successfully completed the plan that was ordered in this
bankruptcy and obtained a discharge in August 2000.
Applicant once again filed for bankruptcy protection in 2003, and again attributed
his financial problems to the loss of income that resulted from a labor strike. The Summary
of Claims listed on page 9 of Item 7 indicates that as of February 15, 2007, Applicant had
paid $35,566.85 in principal and interest under the plan toward the 26 claims totalling
$39,806.36 that had been filed. Page 6 of Item 7 discloses that $141 per week was being
garnished from his wages to make payments under the plan as of February 16, 2007.
6
Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that if Applicant has maintained his employment he has
either successfully completed the plan as of this time or will do so in the very near future.
Applicant’s repeated periods of unemployment, coupled with his divorces and the
resulting child support and maintenance payments, and his legal action in seeking Chapter
13 bankruptcy protection and thereafter making all required payments under the plans
entitle him to application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in
the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and MC 20(d) the individual
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
Department Counsel correctly points out in the FORM that a number of debts listed
in Applicant’s 1989 and 1996 bankruptcies became delinquent before the events which he
claimed triggered his need to seek bankruptcy protection. And, while it is reasonable to
assume it would take Applicant some period of time to regain financial stability after being
unemployed, there is no record evidence to indicate he could not or should not have
resolved some if not all of the delinquent debt, most specifically the state and federal tax
liabilities, prior to having to file a subsequent bankruptcy. 
However, whatever negative connotations may be drawn from Applicant’s failure to
address delinquent debts before those triggering events, is overwhelmingly outweighed by
Applicant’s current financial condition. He is now employed and receives both monthly
military retirement pay and social security. The documents Applicant provided in Item 7
indicate that as of February 2007, his net monthly income is approximately $5,100 and his
net monthly expenses are $2,272. $2,715 of his net monthly income comes from retirement
and social security payments that will continue even if he again experiences a period of
unemployment. Thus, he now has the income to remain current on his expenses
regardless of what happens to his employment. Or, to put it another way, Applicant for the
first time since at least 1984 has found himself in a financially secure position. Accordingly,
Applicant is entitled to application of MC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the security
concerns caused by the financial considerations that are present in this case. He has
overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-d: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
