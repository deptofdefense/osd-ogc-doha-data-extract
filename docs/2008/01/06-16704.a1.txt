APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
Caroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Joni J. Franklin, Esq.
The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to Guideline J and SOR paragraph 1.e.  Those favorable findings are1
not at issue on appeal.
2
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On November 17, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant
of the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the written record.  On August
31, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant’s
request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and
E3.1.30.1
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;
whether the Judge’s unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.
(1) Applicant’s counsel on appeal argues that Applicant was not an attorney and that he did
not know how to collect and present the type of evidence necessary to support his case.  He therefore
asks that the case be remanded so that Applicant can offer additional evidence with the benefit of
representation by counsel.  The Board construes Applicant’s request as raising the issue of whether
Applicant was denied due process.
A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth
in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Applicant requested that his case be decided on the
written record.  He was  provided with a copy of the government’s file of relevant material (FORM),
and given an opportunity to object to those exhibits and provide his own evidence to rebut the
government’s allegations.  Applicant filed a response to the government’s FORM, which included
a detailed explanation and multiple documentary exhibits.  
Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take
timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593
at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that
failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6
(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  DOHA proceedings are civil in nature and applicants are not entitled to
the procedural protections afforded to criminal defendants.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at
5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no
moment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006).  Given the record in this
case, Applicant has no valid claim for denial of due process under the Directive or Executive Order,
and is not entitled to a second opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.    
(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that
the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties had been mitigated because his
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 1998 and was granted a discharge in November 1998.  At that2
time he had $80,196 in assets and $114,640 in liabilities.  In January 2002 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the
filing was dismissed in December 2002 because he defaulted on the payment plan.  At that time he had $285,386 in assets
and $255,496 in liabilities.  In September 2002 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the filing was dismissed in May
2003.  At that time he had $266,811 in assets and $248,857 in liabilities.  In September 2004 he filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy and was granted a discharge in March 2005.  At that time he had $13,080 in assets and $267,481 in liabilities.
3
most recent discharge in bankruptcy  occurred almost three years ago in 2005 and his current2
financial problems are “minor.”  He also argues that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the fact
that he had completed financial counseling.  As part of his appeal, Applicant cites to several DOHA
Hearing Office decisions in which an applicant in ostensibly similar circumstances was granted a
clearance.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant’s arguments do not demonstrate that
the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
The Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has cited in
his appeal brief.  However, such decisions are not binding on Hearing Office Judges or on the Board.
See ISCR Case No. 05-14853 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2007).  They do not demonstrate error in this
case. See ISCR Case No. 06-18340 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007). 
Once there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant’s security eligibility, there
is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v.
Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After theth
government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to
establish mitigation.  Directive ¶ E3.1.15.
The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding
that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the
exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See ISCR Case No. 01-14740
at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone
compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 05-02833
(App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and
decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An
applicant’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a
different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the
evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See
ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).
Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that
the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the
Judge’s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.3.  
In this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of financial difficulties
which had resulted in multiple bankruptcies.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by
4
Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the
possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  He found in favor of Applicant as to SOR
paragraph 1.e and the Guideline J allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence
which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government’s
security concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate
the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041
at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was
before him, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.
Order
The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
