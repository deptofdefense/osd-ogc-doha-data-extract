Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order
and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on July 19, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an
administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this
case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial
problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   
In addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)
approved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then
modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or
replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all
  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(December 29, 2005). 
2
adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September
1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised2
Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  
Applicant replied to the SOR on October 3, 2007, and requested a hearing. The
hearing took place as scheduled on December 19, 2007, and the transcript (Tr.) was
received on January 10, 2008.
The record was left open until December 28, 2007, to allow Applicant an
opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely
submitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The post-
hearing matters are marked and admitted as follows: (1) documentary exhibits
supplementing Exhibits A through O as designated by Applicant; (2) Applicant’s resume
as Exhibit P; and (3) an exhibit related to Exhibits A, B, D, F, G, and O as Exhibit Q. For
the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. 
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts ranging from $218 to
$13,568 for about $62,000 in total. The debts are described as charged-off bad debts
and collection accounts. A large part of the indebtedness stems from seven student
loans for nearly $41,000 in total, on which Applicant was in default. In his response to
the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations and provided explanations about
his efforts to address the debts. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following
facts are established by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 29-year-old programmer. He has worked for his current employer
since December 2006. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the Defense
Department the first time.
He incurred the student loan obligations while attending college. During
1996–1999, he attended an aeronautical university where he studied engineering and
aerospace studies. He did not earn a degree at that time. During 2000–2003, he
attended another university and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in computer
science in August 2003. He then enrolled in law school, as a part-time student, and was
recently awarded a J.D. He was involved in various extracurricular activities in law
school, to include serving in the student bar association where he rose to serve as a
vice-chair at the national level. He is now on an informal leave of absence from his
defense contractor employer while he studies for the bar exam. 
Applicant’s father passed away in 1997. His mother was diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer in 2006 and passed away in April 2007. As an only child, he assumed
3
responsibility for watching over and caring for his mother while she was ill. He withdrew
from law school twice, once to care for her after surgery and then when she was gravely
ill. On both occasions, Applicant was unable to work. Also as an only child, he was his
mother’s sole heir. He inherited a used car worth $1,000 to $2,000 and a condo with an
estimated market value of about $110,000. The condo has a mortgage on it, but there is
approximately $50,000 in equity in the property. In addition, he  received $50,000 as the
beneficiary of his mother’s life-insurance policy. 
Applicant used the windfall to address his outstanding financial obligations. He
still has the car and he intends to sell it. He continues to own the condo, which has the
possibility of producing a monthly income as a rental property. He is not inclined to sell
the condo now as the real estate market is relatively weak. The status of his
indebtedness, as alleged in the SOR, is summarized in the following table.

SOR ¶ 1.n–student loan for $13,568. Settled in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit N).
SOR ¶ 1.o–collection account for $218. Paid in Sep. 2007 (Exhibit O).
To sum up, Applicant has settled or paid all the indebtedness except for the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, which are discussed below.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is for a charged-off credit card account for $5,834.
According to the current creditor, the current account balance is $7,215 and they have
offered to settle for $5,772 if payment is received by January 10, 2008 (after the record
closed in this case). Although he has the money to make the lump-sum payment, he
would prefer to resolve the account by a repayment agreement, which would improve
his cash flow.
The seven student loans belong to two creditors. Four loans belong to one
creditor and were settled in September 2007. The three student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.h,
1.i, and 1.j belong to another creditor. Applicant is resolving these three debts by a
repayment agreement that began in October 2007 when he made an initial good-faith
payment for more than $5,000. The repayment agreement, which addresses all three
student loans, calls for him to make monthly payments of $533 until August 2008. He
made payments in a timely manner in November and December. 
Applicant has about $15,000 in cash reserves in addition to the car and condo.
This money is available to pay for his living expenses while he studies for the bar exam
as well as for paying debts as discussed above. He attributes his financial problems to
youth and inexperience as well as some periodic underemployment and unemployment.
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an4
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any5
existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any

level.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether6
an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting7
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An8
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate9
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme10
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11
The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination13
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
 Revised Guidelines at pp. 13–14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 14
 Revised Guidelines at p. 13. 15
 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 16
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 17
 MC 4 is “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”18

Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically14
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be15
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it
indicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations16 17
within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to
establish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.
Of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F, the most pertinent here is MC 4,
which requires a person to initiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts.  Applicant has made substantial efforts to resolve the18
delinquent debts. He has settled or paid nearly all. One was pending settlement at the
time of the hearing and another was three months into a repayment agreement. He
appears to have the financial resources to resolve the remaining matters in due course.
His efforts are more than sufficient to constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of
the guideline.  
Applicant is 29 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about
his finances. He has demonstrated his financial maturity by using a windfall to resolve
delinquent debts instead of blowing the money on a new car or a fancy vacation or both.
Unlike many applicants in financial cases, Applicant has (1) a realistic and workable
plan to clean up his financial house, (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the
plan, and (3) shown a measurable improvement to the situation. It appears that his
financial problems are unlikely to continue or recur.  
7
To conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or
mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant met his ultimate burden
of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.o  For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
