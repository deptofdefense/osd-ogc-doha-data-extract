HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate financial considerations security concerns. He did not 
provide sufficient evidence of his efforts to resolve six of his 14 delinquent debts, 
totaling about $22,000. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, modified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under 
 
1Government Exhibit (GE) 7 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 22, 2008). GE 7 is the 
source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. 
 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.2 
 
On June 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a 
hearing (GE 8). On July 25, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held on 
August 21, 2008, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 
26-27), and Applicant offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE A-B) (Tr. 29-30, 74). There were 
no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-H (Tr. 27, 30, 74). Additionally, I 
admitted the Hearing Notice (GE 6), SOR (GE 7), and Applicant’s response to the SOR 
(GE 8). I received the transcript on September 8, 2008. I received additional 
documentation on September 23 and 24, 2008, and on October 6 and 8, 2008. I closed 
the record on October 8, 2008.  
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 
1.f, 1.i, 1.j and 1.l, with explanations (GE 8). He denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 
1.k, 1.m and 1.n (GE 8). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following 
findings of fact.4    
 
Applicant is 43 years old (Tr. 5).5 In 1990, he received a bachelor of science 
degree from a service academy (Tr. 6). He currently holds an interim secret clearance 
(Tr. 6). In 1994, he left active duty as a captain (Tr. 19). He wanted to become an 
entrepreneur (Tr. 19). After leaving active service he went into the Individual Ready 
Reserve (IRR) (Tr. 19). He maintained his readiness to be recalled should the country 
need him in a conflict (Tr. 19). Immediately after the attack on September 11, 2001, he 
volunteered to return to active duty (Tr. 20-21). While Applicant was in the IRR, the 
 
2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. GE 8 (Response to SOR) is the source for the facts in this 
section unless stated otherwise.   
  
4There was no objection, and I approved admission of Applicant’s opening statement as 
substantive evidence (Tr. 20). 
 
5GE 1 (2008 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless 
stated otherwise. I accepted Applicant’s opening statement as substantive evidence (Tr. 30).

Army sent his personnel record before a promotion board to major (Tr. 22). He was 
passed over for promotion to major because he was not educationally qualified (he 
evidently had not completed his Captain’s Career Course)(Tr. 22, AE A at 3-4). 
Because he was passed over for promotion, the Army declined to accept him on active 
duty as a volunteer in 2001-2002 (Tr. 22-23). Applicant was honorably discharged from 
the IRR in 2003 (Tr. 22).     
 
Applicant assumed when he left active duty that he would be able to obtain a 
Small Business Administration (SBA) loan (Tr. 32). He thought he could rely on his 
veteran’s preference (Tr. 32). He learned he needed a positive cash flow for five years 
to qualify for an SBA loan (Tr. 32-33).   
  
Applicant ran a corporation from about 1996 to 2000 (Tr. 31). He was the sole 
shareholder of his corporation (Tr. 39). The corporation at one point had two employees 
(Tr. 66). The corporate product involved installation of back-up or standby power 
systems (Tr. 31, AE A at 2). Most of his delinquent SOR debt was related to this 
business (Tr. 31). He was proud of his business accomplishments, which did show 
some success (Tr. 21). He did not consider his business endeavor to be reckless or ill-
conceived (Tr. 33).  
 
Applicant placed his corporate records into a storage unit; however, he was 
unable to pay the rent for his storage (Tr. 35). The storage company disposed of his 
records (Tr. 35, 66). He did not have corporate tax records or filings (Tr. 66). He said 
the landlord/creditor listed in SOR ¶ 1.d, who was seeking payment of rent was fully 
aware the debt was corporate (Tr. 37). Applicant explained: 
 
. . . they’re fully aware that this was a corporate debt, but because they 
know my name and they know how to put something on my credit report, 
they put it on the credit report. I don’t think it should legitimately be there. 
But—you know—that’s a battle I haven’t fought. 
 
(Tr. 37). When the corporation failed, he made no effort to pay his debts, he just “walked 
away from the business” (Tr. 40). He did not take action to officially disband the 
business (Tr. 40). Up to the time of his hearing, he had not contacted the creditors to 
obtain information linking the debt to his prior corporation (Tr. 38-39). He did not contact 
the creditors to protest the debts (Tr. 38). He did research the landlord’s debt (SOR ¶ 
1.d), but was unable to locate any record about the current existence of the creditor (Tr. 
38). Applicant has not declared bankruptcy, and his corporation did not declare 
bankruptcy (Tr. 39). 
 
In 2000, Applicant obtained employment with a contractor, providing support to 
the Army (Tr. 20). His initial salary was about $80,000 per year (Tr. 41). His gross salary 
is now about $120,000 per year (Tr. 42). He has developed substantial expertise and 
acquired specialized, institutional knowledge (Tr. 25). The military personnel frequently 
turnover and he has worked loyally to help the Army in his area of specialization (Tr. 
26). His work on behalf of the Army is valuable (Tr. 25). 
 
 
4 
 
 Applicant married twice and has four children and one step-child (Tr. 42). He is 
paying child support for five children (Tr. 43). His children range in age from five to 15 
(Tr. 83). His first marriage failed because of financial pressure from his business (Tr. 
80). His second marriage failed because his spouse was a violent alcoholic (Tr. 81). 
Applicant said he worked out a budget but was unable to afford to pay his delinquent 
debts for his business (Tr. 44). After his hearing he provided the following budget 
information (Tr. 45; AE E at 15):  wages after taxes: $5,890 and expenses $5,204 (rent: 
$1,000; auto: $480; child support: $2,200; food: $500; clothing: $100; transportation: 
$450; insurance: $50; telephone: $29; internet: $50; debt payments: $300; and storage: 
$45). After tax income minus expenses equals $686.    
 
  Although Applicant did not have documentation to establish the existence of his 
corporation at his hearing (Tr. 34), he subsequently provided documents establishing 
the corporation’s existence (AE E at 4-11).  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts, totaling about $29,000. Their 
current status is summarized in the table below:

¶ 1.n Medical debt $118 Not established (Tr. 59-61, GE 3 at 5) 
 
Applicant attributed the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f and 1.i, 1.j and 1.l 
to his corporation (Tr. 34, 47-53).  I explained to Applicant that he needed to provide 
records proving the corporation owed the debts rather than Applicant personally or he 
would lose his clearance (Tr. 67, 69-71, 74-75). I told him to go to the creditors and get 
copies of the documents showing he owed the debts (Tr. 67-75). He said he understood 
 
 
5 
 
what was required, and he agreed to request documentation to establish the corporate 
responsibility for his debts (Tr. 68-70, 75-79). On September 21, 2008, Applicant wrote 
letters requesting records from the court that approved the three judgements in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a (AE H at 9), 1.b (AE H at 9) and 1.d (AE H at 10). On September 21, 2008, he wrote 
the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.e (AE H at 13), 1.i (AE H at 12) and 1.l (AE H at 11) asking for 
case documentation.  The five letters in AE H 9-13 did not dispute or contest the validity 
of any of the SOR debts. 
 
In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he said his corporation owed the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d (GE 3 at 2). For other debts, he said he incurred the debt “for the 
purpose of operating” his corporation (GE 3 at 2-6). In an email dated October 3, 2008, 
Applicant elaborated on the issue of whether his remaining unresolved debts were 
corporate as opposed to personal stating: 
 
In order to be granted unsecured loans/lines of credit and contracts, such 
as facility and truck leases for [my corporation], it was often necessary for 
me to provide my SSN as the corporate officer and place my personal 
credit at risk for the purpose of starting and operating the company. I 
always tried to secure resources using the corporation first and only 
resorted to placing my personal credit at risk as a last resort. 
 
[The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d] certainly did know that I was running a 
corporation right down the hall in the same building as their business 
headquarters.  Hence, the directory that they placed on their wall [included 
the name of my corporation]. 
 
[The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.l] would not lease [my corporation] a truck unless 
I, as the corporate officer, also placed my own credit rating at risk. I first 
tried to use only the corporation, but that request was denied. 
 
Monthly statements for other unsecured loans/lines of credit were 
addressed to both my name and [my corporation’s name] and sent to [my 
home address]. 
 
Applicant concluded his statement, succinctly explaining why he was not a 
security risk: 
 
I served my country with distinction while in the Army.  I have been 
working as an Army contractor since August 2000.  I have held an Interim 
Secret Clearance since July 2004.  My job performance has been superior 
and I am providing a high value service to the USA in my current career 
position.  I have never and will never take any action that would place the 
USA's security at risk.  I am willing to die in the service of the USA and 
that is why I am a confirmed volunteer for the current operation.

Recommendations and Character Materials 
 
 Applicant completed airborne, air assault and flight training (AE B at 10, 11 and 
15-17). He completed several other military training courses. He volunteered in his 
community (AE B at 14). He was selected for captain in 1994 (AE B at 21). He received 
several letters and certificates of training, commendation and appreciation while on 
active duty (AE B at 11-25). He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal (AE B at 23), 
and two awards of the Army Commendation Medal (AE B at 24, 25). Applicant’s officer 
evaluation reports contained very positive statements about his leadership, dedication 
and integrity (AE B at 1-9, AE E at 16-25, 40-41, 43-50).6 He often received “top block” 
evaluations in his senior rater’s profile (AE E at 16-25).  
 
An Army brigadier general gave Applicant a note lauding him for his hard work on 
an important Army project (Tr. 24). Applicant did a “super job” making an important 
presentation about the project for an Army major general and a civilian (Tr. 24). The 
brigadier general emphasized Applicant’s exceptional hard work and diligence (Tr. 24-
25). His evaluations as a contractor showed outstanding service and contributions (AE 
B at 27-28). 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
 
6 Some of the documentation in AE B and E is duplicated.  
 
 
7 
 
                                           
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”7 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
 
7 See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” ISCR 
Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “Substantial evidence” is 
“more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 
F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
8 “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his or her burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ 
E3.1.15.” ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).

protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had . 
.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent 
debt is documented in his credit reports (GE 4-5), his response to DOHA interrogatories 
(GE 3), and his SOR response (GE 8). However, I am satisfied that he paid the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($37), 1.k ($735) and 1.m ($100). The creditor waived collection of any debt 
owed in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j (AE I). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($118) is not established. The 
issue of delinquent debt owed to six creditors remains for resolution. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(b) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve six delinquent 
SOR debts. Applicant has not shown any significant progress resolving his six 
delinquent debts totaling about $22,000. His financial problems are not isolated. The 
ongoing nature of his delinquent debts is “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
 
 
9 
 
                                           
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because the debt “occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment.” He has been paying his non-SOR debts. Under AG ¶ 20(b), he 
receives partial mitigation because his financial situation was damaged through his 
divorces and he has a heavy child support burden of $2,400 per month. However, he 
did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his six delinquent debts.9 He 
admitted that he has not maintained contact with these six creditors, and made no 
recent efforts to set up payment plans or otherwise resolve these six debts.    
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) have limited application. Applicant did not disclose 
financial counseling. There are some indications that “that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control” because the amount of delinquent debt is not that large, and there is 
no new delinquent debt. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant 
showed good faith10 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) mitigates his debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.h. Although he did not 
provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute” with respect to 
these debts, I will give him credit for mitigating them. The creditor waived collection of 
any debt owed in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j (AE I). I found him to be credible concerning these 
debts. He was unable to locate the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d, and as such was unable to 
pay this debt. The Government did not provide a current address for the creditor in SOR 
¶ 1.d. Applicant returned the equipment and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h is minor at $94. I will 
find “For Applicant” with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j in the decretal paragraph 
of this decision.   
 
9“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
10 
 
 
I conclude Applicant’s overall conduct in regard to six delinquent debts casts 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His six remaining 
delinquent SOR debts total about $22,000 and likely will remain at that level for the 
foreseeable future. He is unable to come to terms and accept full responsibility for these 
debts because of their connection to his defunct corporation. Nevertheless, he is an 
honest, hard-working employee, a good father, and patriot. He is an honorable former 
Army officer. I have no doubt that he is loyal and would give his life for the United 
States. Notwithstanding these positive attributes, he has not established his financial 
responsibility and that he has the judgment necessary to hold a security clearance. 
Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating 
conditions fully apply. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).   
There is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant’s conduct under the whole 
person concept. He is not financially sophisticated. He did not seem to understand that 
he is financially responsible for the debts his corporation incurred because he agreed in 
contracts that he was personally liable for those debts. His dedication to his children 
from his previous marriages is a very positive indication of his good character and 
trustworthiness. He is a patriot and is completely loyal to his country. Applicant’s record 
of good employment, and strong military record weighs in his favor. There is no 
evidence of any security violation. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid.  
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative 
guidelines is not sufficient to warrant a clearance at this time. The overall amount of his 
delinquent debts at about $22,000 is substantial. He has been aware of his delinquent 
debts since 2000. He has done little to address his six still delinquent debts and did not

promise to pay these debts. Applicant learned of the security significance of his 
delinquent debt when he received the SOR, and did not use the next five months to 
address his six delinquent SOR debts. He made no real progress in resolving these six 
delinquent SOR debts. His handling of his six delinquent SOR debts shows lack of 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i to 1.k:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
