HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP), on July 4, 2007. On June 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the 
revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 
1, 2006.  
  
 On July 26, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2008. On August 
15, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for September 11, 
2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered four exhibits which 
were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 4 without objection. Applicant testified 
and offered 25 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A – Y without 
objection. The transcript was received on September 22, 2008. Based upon a review of 
 
2 
 
 
the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old electrical engineer employed with a Department of 
Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the 
defense contractor since 2002. First as a contract employee, then he became a 
permanent employee in March 2003. He has a Masters Degree in Electrical 
Engineering. He is also a Lieutenant in the United States Navy Reserves. He previously 
served on active duty in the United States Navy as an enlisted man. He received an 
Honorable Discharge on February 22, 2001. He received his commission later in 2001. 
He has held a security clearance since 1997. He is married and has three children, two 
daughters, ages 8 and 5, and a son, age 3. (Tr at 6-7, 25-26; Gov 1; AE Y at 3.) 
   
On July 4, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) He disclosed several delinquent debts in 
response to section 27 on his questionnaire. A subsequent background investigation 
confirmed that Applicant had the following  delinquent accounts:  an $8,873 credit card  
account that was charged off in August 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; 
Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 11); a $776 credit account that was charged off in August 2002 
(SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 10); a $3,223 credit 
card account that was charged off in July 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 
5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 6); a credit card account that was past due in the approximate 
amount of $428 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9); and 
a $19,139 credit card account that was placed for collection in October 2004 (SOR ¶ 
1.e; Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 16; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 5).  
 
Additional delinquent accounts include: a $1,437 credit card account that was 
charged off as a bad debt in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 
at 2; Gov 4 at 8); a $2,660 credit card account placed for collection in July 2003 (SOR ¶ 
1.g: Gov 1, section 27; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 7, 10); a $282 phone account 
that was placed for collection in December 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 4 at 10-
11); a $168 phone account that was past due in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 1, section 
27); and a $29 medical account that was placed for collection in July 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.j: 
Gov 1, section 27; Gov 3 at 1). 
 
In 2001, Applicant was out of work for three months. He found contract work out 
of state in 2002 and worked several months. The contract would terminate and he 
would be out of work for several weeks. Applicant estimates that he was unemployed 
for three months in 2002 until he was hired by his current company. During 2001 and 
2002, he and his wife relied on credit cards for living expenses. He was unable to catch 
up with late payments and interest fees. (Tr at 23-24.) 
 
 
3 
 
 
In late 2003, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt repayment firm. He 
paid into the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. (AE A) In 2006, 
his oldest daughter developed medical problems. She eventually had surgery in late 
2006. His younger daughter had a medical issue which required weekly therapy 
sessions. His son had a surgical procedure in December 2006. Applicant’s extra 
medical bills made him unable to keep up with payments on his debt repayment plan. 
He had paid down approximately $20,000 of his debt balance prior to that time. (Tr at 
26-29; AE I; AE J.) 
 
After he stopped making payments towards his debt repayment plan, Applicant’s 
debt balances began to grow as a result of penalties and late fees.  He still attempted to 
resolve his debts with individual creditors but the creditors demanded payments that he 
could not afford. (Tr at 29.) 
 
In 2007, Applicant’s financial situation became more stable and he began to set 
up payment agreements with some of his creditors.  In May 2008, he entered into a new 
repayment agreement with the debt repayment firm. Payments began in July 2008. 
Applicant pays $283 monthly into the plan. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, 
are included in the repayment plan. (Tr at 43, 60; AE H; AE I at 1; AE P.)   
 
The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a, $8,873 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid on this debt 
from 2003 to April 2006 during his initial debt repayment plan. He sent a total of $5,087 
to this account during this time. (AE A at 1-3.) He was unable to reach an agreement 
between May 2006 to March 2008. In April 2008, Applicant contacted the creditor and 
entered into an agreement to pay $370 per month over a period of 24 months.  
Payments started in June 2008. (Tr at 41, 44-45; AE A at 4-5; AE M; AE Q.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b, $776 charged off credit card account:  Applicant paid on this debt 
from December 2003 to April 2006 though his initial debt repayment plan. He paid a 
total amount of $1,386.  He attempted to include the creditor on his current debt 
repayment plan in April 2008. He was not successful so he contacted the creditor and 
set up payment arrangements from May 2008 to November 2008. He made a $115 
payment in May 2008 and a $35 payment in June 2008. (Tr at 41; AE B; AE L.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c, $3,223 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid $1,589 in 
payments on this account during his debt repayment plan from 2003 to 2006.  Since 
January 2008, he has been paying $57.57 a month to the agency collecting on behalf of 
this creditor. (Tr at 32; AE C.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d, $428 credit card account that is past due: Applicant paid $1,597 
during his initial repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. Applicant made 
various payments on this account in February 2007, April 2007, August 2007, 
November 2007, January 2008, February 2008, March 2008, and April 2008. In May 
2008, this debt was included in his new repayment plan.  Applicant admits this account  
 
4 
 
 
remained past due even though payments were made but claims it will soon be 
changed to current based on the consistent payments that are being made on his debt 
repayment plan. (Tr at 30; AE D.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e, $19,139 account placed for collection:  Applicant and his wife 
charged $7,000 of their wedding expenses on this account. He paid $9,946 towards this 
account in his previous debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. In 
November 2007 and December 2007, he made a $50 payment towards this debt. He 
has been sending in $200 monthly since January 2008. (Tr at 33, 42; 58; AE E; AE N.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f, $1,437 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid this creditor 
$477 under the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. This account is 
included in Applicant’s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE F; AE 
P.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g, $2,660 charged off credit card account: Applicant paid this creditor 
$519 under the debt repayment plan from December 2003 to April 2006. This account is 
included in Applicant’s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE G; 
AE P.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h, $282 phone account placed for collection: This account is included in 
Applicant’s recent debt repayment plan which began in May 2008. (AE H; AE P.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i, $168 past due phone account: Applicant became aware of this debt in 
June 2008. He set up a payment arrangement to pay this debt off in three months. He 
will pay $50 for August and September 2008 and the remaining $68 in October 2008. 
(Tr at 42, 45; AE H; AE O; AE R.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j, $29 pediatric medical account placed for collection. Applicant planned 
to resolve this debt at the end of July 2008. He did not become aware of this debt until 
he reviewed his credit report in June 2008. (Tr at 38; AE I.)  
 
Applicant’s net monthly income is $5,635 which includes his reserve income. His 
wife does not work.  Monthly expenses include rent: $1,400, groceries: $300, utilities: 
$454, clothing: $100, car expenses: $492, medical: $150, alimony/child 
support/daycare: $400, miscellaneous expenses: $740. His car payments are $308.61 
and $358.21. His total monthly expenses are $4,702.82. Assuming Applicant paid off 
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j, his monthly debt payments total $931.  This 
leaves $1.18 left over after expenses. (Tr at 57-58; Gov 2 at 10-11.)  
 
It is likely that Applicant may have more money left over each month after 
expenses.  He listed $740 in miscellaneous expenses, a rather high figure. In 
parentheses next to this figure he indicated “explanation included” but no explanation 
was included in Gov 2. In addition, he listed $400 for alimony/child support/daycare. 
However, it does not appear that Applicant was previously married and/or had a child 
 
5 
 
 
from a previous relationship. Considering that his wife does not work, a $400 monthly 
daycare expense seems unlikely. (Gov 2 at 10.)   
 
Applicant never tried to hide his financial situation. He is current on his federal 
taxes. He follows a budget. His children’s medical problems have improved. When he 
entered into the debt management program, he was provided a compact disk which 
contained a program on how the manage one’s finances. Applicant also reads books on 
financial management. He is committed to resolving his debts. (Tr at 52, 56; 61-62.)  
 
Applicant’s Pastor wrote a letter on his behalf. Applicant is a member in good 
standing at the church who serves as a role model for youth and adults. He is devoted 
to his family, job and country. He was recommended to become a Deacon based on his 
character. He has held numerous offices in the church. (AE S.)  
 
Applicant’s supervisor has supervised Applicant over the past six years. He is 
pleased with his work and dedication.  He spent many hours above and beyond the call 
of duty to ensure timely completion of critical tasks on the projects he has worked on. 
He can works well with other team members and can be relied on to “get things done.” 
He recommends him for a security clearance. (AE T.) 
 
Applicant’s commanding officer in the United States Navy Reserves states 
Applicant has done an outstanding job as executive officer over the past 17 months. He 
takes a personal interest in the professional and private lives of all unit members.  He 
has high ethics, morals and ideals. His commander recommends that his security 
clearance be continued. (AE U.) His commanding officer from October 2004 to October 
2007, recommends reinstatement of his security clearance. He notes Applicant has 
always been rated as one of the unit’s top performers. He is a trustworthy and 
outstanding officer. (AE V.) Another former commander indicates Applicant served as 
his assistant training officer.  He was very organized and kept track of the unit members’ 
travel and training.  He claims Applicant is one of the best junior officers that he has 
worked with in over 29 years of active and reserve navy service. (AE W.) 
 
Applicant’s fitness reports both enlisted and officer state Applicant meets or is 
above standards. (AE X.) His awards and decorations include the Navy and Marine 
Corps Achievement Medal. In February 1999, he was awarded the Division Outstanding 
Team Builder Award. (AE Y.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
 
6 
 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
7 
 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations); and FC DC ¶ 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one’s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant’s case.  
Applicant has accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt since 2001. The 
SOR alleges ten debts, an approximate total balance of $37,015.  While some 
mitigating factors apply to Applicant’s case, most of the delinquent debts are credit card 
accounts. His excessive indebtedness indicates that he and his wife have consistently 
spent beyond their means.  
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations 
Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant’s case: FC MC ¶ 20(a) (the 
behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant 
initially enrolled in a debt repayment program in 2003. He was unable to complete the 
program and stopped paying some of his accounts in December 2006. He recently 
entered into another debt repayment plan and has entered into repayment agreements 
with other creditors who are not included in the plan. However, he recently entered into 
these repayment agreements. Given his history of financial irresponsibility, it is too soon 
to conclude Applicant developed a track record of financial stability. FC MC ¶ 20(b) 
does not apply.   
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant’s periods of 
unemployment in 2001 and 2002 contributed to his financial problems. To his credit, he 
entered a debt repayment plan in 2003 and consistently made payments until April 2006 
when he was unable to continue the plan because of his three children’s medical 
 
8 
 
 
issues. His periods of unemployment and his children’s health issues are certainly 
factors that were beyond his control. In 2008, Applicant started to deal with his debt 
again and has entered into repayment agreements with each of his creditors. He has 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) applies. Applicant received financial counseling when he entered his debt 
repayment agreement. He established a budget and entered into repayment plans with 
each of his creditors. Admittedly, Applicant’s budget is rather tight and he has a long 
way to go to complete his repayment plans, but his financial situation is beginning to 
stabilize. Applicant is given credit for having a plan to resolve his debts. However, 
considering the extent of the debt it will take some time for the delinquent debts to be 
resolved.  
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. From December 2003 to April 2006, 
Applicant consistently made payments towards his first debt repayment plan. His 
children’s health issues prevented him from continuing the plan. His financial situation 
has stabilized and he re-enrolled in a debt repayment plan which includes four of the  
debts alleged in the SOR. He entered into repayment agreements with the six remaining 
debts. He has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue accounts. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable 
comments of Applicant’s supervisor, commanders, and Pastor. I considered Applicant’s 
record in the United States Navy both as an officer and as an enlisted man. I considered  
Applicant’s difficulty in finding a stable and well paying job in 2001/2002. I considered 
that he was faithfully making payments towards a debt management plan from April 
2003 to December 2006 until the financial burdens of his children’s medical issues 
 
9 
 
 
made him unable to make payments.  As soon as his financial situation stabilized, he 
established a plan to pay his delinquent accounts. While it may take some time for 
Applicant to resolve his delinquent accounts, he has taken adequate measures to 
control his financial situation in the future. The recommendations of Applicant’s Pastor, 
supervisor, and past and present commanders indicate Applicant is reliable, trustworthy, 
and able to protect classified information. For these reasons, Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  
 
    Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
