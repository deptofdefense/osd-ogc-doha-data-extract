Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order
and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 29, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an
administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this
case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial
problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. 
In addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.
The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective
September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2
  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(December 29, 2005).

to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR
has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision2
or amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the
effective date.  
Applicant replied to the SOR on June 22, 2007, and again on November 30,
2007, when he formally requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on
December 20, 2007. The hearing was originally scheduled for January 31, 2008, but
was rescheduled at Applicant’s request. The hearing took place on March 13, 2008. The
transcript (Tr.) was received on March 21, 2008.
The record was left open until April 11, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to
provide additional documentary information. Those matters were timely received and
department counsel had no objections to admissibility. The post-hearing matters are
collectively admitted as Applicant’s Exhibit M, with parts 1 – 5, which correspond to the
paragraphs numbered 1 – 5 in the cover letter. 
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant has a history of financial problems
based on an unpaid judgment for $7,018 and delinquent consumer debts ranging from
$146 to $7,268, for a combined total of about $38,000. In his Answer to the SOR, he
denied the debts on the basis that they were resolved to the best of his knowledge.
Also, he provided a letter to explain the circumstances that led to the financial problems.
Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He was recently
promoted to the position of branch manager supporting a missile defense program. His
educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in business administration (Exhibit
C). He has worked in his current job since December 2006 (Exhibit D). His employment
history includes more than two decades of active duty military service as an Army
officer, which ended in retirement in 2004. His performance reviews, awards, and other
documentation reflect a topnotch Army officer who was highly regarded by his superiors
(Exhibits A and B). After retiring from the Army, he worked as a federal employee until
relocating to his current state of residence to care for his father, who passed away in
June 2006 (Exhibit M, part 5). 
Applicant is married and the father of four children. Two children, young adults,
are from his first marriage that ended in divorce in 1991, when he was awarded custody
of the children. He married again in 1992. He and his wife also had two children.
Currently, three of the children are living in his household. 
3
His financial problems stem from the 2001–2003 period when Applicant was the
commanding officer of a contract agency on the west coast of the U.S. (his speciality
was procurement and acquisition). This position, equivalent to a battalion command,
required Applicant to work long duty hours and travel away from home, to include an
overseas deployment for several months. During this period, Applicant’s wife was
diagnosed as suffering from depression (Tr. 80–83). The psychiatrist who diagnosed
her treated her with medications such as lithium and a sleeping aid. In addition, she was
taking muscle relaxers and pain pills due to back problems. 
Like many military couples, Applicant’s wife was primarily responsible for
managing the family finances, to include bill paying, to allow Applicant to focus on his
career and in light of the potential for deployment anywhere in the world. Depressed,
she began to miss payments and overspend with credit cards. She was under the care
of a psychiatrist and a psychologist until she left the west coast. She has since been off
all medications and is no longer under medical care for depression.  
Applicant began to learn of the financial problems when he was deployed
overseas in 2002 or 2003 when a credit-card purchase was refused. But he did not
discover the full extent of the situation until about April 2004 (Tr. 40-41, 87–88). By that
time, he had completed the overseas deployment and his command tour, and he and
his family had returned to the east coast of the U.S. Applicant, then serving as a
lieutenant colonel, completed a security-clearance application in August 2003 (Exhibit
1). He disclosed no adverse or derogatory information in response to any of the several
questions about his financial record. He later learned the full extent of his financial
problems several months later in April 2004, when he was interviewed during the
background investigation.  
Applicant retired from the Army in about September 2004. He did so due to a
history of back problems, which twice required surgery. The second surgery in
December 2003 resulted in a prolonged recovery period when he was taking pain
medication. He was still having problems walking in March 2004. His treating physician
suggested it was best for him to retire and he followed that advice. He received a 40%
VA disability rating based on his back problems.
His history of financial problems dates back to his time in the Army and is
established by several credit reports (Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The debts alleged in
the SOR are addressed below.
The first debt is a judgment for $7,018 (SOR ¶ 1.a). The lawsuit was brought in
January 2005, and a default judgment was obtained in March 2005 (Exhibit 3).
Applicant and his wife believe they paid this debt (Tr. 43–44). But the documentary
information is inconclusive. A payoff letter from the creditor (a collection agency),
addresses a different account (Exhibit I). The series of bank payments, totaling about
$6,000, that were made to this creditor began in April 2004 and ended in May 2005, and
all but two of the payments predate the judgment (Exhibit M, part 2). In addition, the
judgment appears as unresolved on the most recent credit reports from 2007 and 2008
4
(Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly, without a satisfaction or release of
judgment, a payoff letter, or some other conclusive documentation, the judgment for
$7,018 is unresolved.
The second debt is for a collection account for $212 (SOR ¶ 1.b). It stems from a
medical account that was overlooked between moves. It was paid in June 2007
(Exhibits F and M, part 1 at 4). Accordingly, this debt is resolved. 
The third debt is a bad debt for $567 (SOR ¶ 1.c). A credit report indicates the
bad debt is based on an overdraft charge or claim by a bank (Exhibit 5 at 7–8).
Applicant’s spouse believes the debt is based on personal property tax that was added
to a car lease when the car was returned under the terms of the lease (Tr. 46–50). She
is certain that it has been paid based on her conversations with the bank and due to the
fact that she and Applicant have accounts with this bank (See Exhibit M, part 4).
Accordingly, the debt is resolved.
The fourth debt is a bad debt for $614 (SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant cleared this
account with the creditor/bank in January 2008 (Exhibit K). The account number
identified in the letter appears to match the account number in the credit report (Exhibits
K and 7 at 2). Accordingly, this debt is resolved.
The fifth debt is a collection account for $1,527 (SOR ¶ 1.e). It was paid with a
payment of $2,073 in December 2007 or January 2008 (Exhibit J). Accordingly, this
debt is resolved. 
The sixth debt is a bad debt for $2,664 (SOR ¶ 1.f). It appears to stem from a
credit card account that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 4; Exhibit 6 at 5). Applicant and his
wife believe they paid this debt (Tr. 51–52). But the relevant document does not contain
an account number that matches the account number in the credit reports (Tr. 67;
Exhibit K). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved.  
The seventh debt is a bad debt for $146 (SOR ¶ 1.g). It appears to stem from a
gas credit card that went into collection (Exhibit 5 at 5; Exhibit 6 at 5). Applicant’s
spouse is certain the debt was paid some time ago (Tr. 52, 67–68). It does not appear
on the credit reports from 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly,
this debt is resolved. 
The eighth debt is a bad debt for $1,654 (SOR ¶ 1.h). It appears to stem from a
credit card that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 6). Applicant’s spouse paid
this through a collection agency (Tr. 53–54). It does not appear on the credit reports
from 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Accordingly, this debt is resolved. 
The ninth debt is a bad debt for $383 (SOR ¶ 1.i). It appears to stem from a
credit card that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 6). This account was paid
with a $5,678 payment to a collection agency in November 2007 (Exhibit H).
Accordingly, this debt is resolved. 
5
The tenth debt is a bad debt for $613 (SOR ¶ 1.j). It appears to stem from a
credit card account that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 6; Exhibit 6 at 7). It was paid
through a collection agency with a payment of $1,789 in May 2004 (Tr. 54; Exhibit M,
part 2), Accordingly, this debt is resolved. 
The 11  debt is a bad debt for $4,275 (SOR ¶ 1.k). It appears to stem from anth
account that was charged off (Exhibit 5 at 7; Exhibit 6 at 7–8; Exhibit M, part 1 at 3).
According to the January 2008 credit report, the account was charged off as of June
2002 with $4,275 written off when it was purchased by another lender (Exhibit M, part 1
at 3). The account was paid off in December 2007 or January 2008 (Exhibit I). The
payoff letter from the collection agency contains an account number that matches the
account number in the credit reports. The January 2008 credit report indicates the
account was paid to a collection agency in settlement for less than the full balance
(Exhibit M, part 1 at 5). Accordingly, this debt is resolved.  
The 12  debt is a bad debt for $7,268 (SOR ¶ 1.l). It was paid by a series ofth
payments to a collection agency (Tr. 55-56). The series of payments, totaling about
$6,000, began in April 2004 and ended in May 2005 (Exhibit M, part 2). This debt does
not appear on the credit reports from 2007 and 2008 (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1).
Accordingly, this debt is resolved.
The 13  debt is a bad debt for $6,860 (SOR ¶ 1.m). It appears to stem from ath
credit card that was charged off (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). Applicant’s spouse
believes this was paid off in 2006 (Tr. 56), but Applicant did not present paperwork to
support that belief (Tr. 70–71). The January 2008 credit report—it is the most recent,
complete, and understandable credit report in evidence—indicates that the account was
charged off with a past-due balance of $6,860 as of January 2008 (Exhibit M, part 1 at
5). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved.
The 14  debt is a bad debt for $4,412 (SOR ¶ 1.n). It appears to stem from ath
credit card that was charged off (Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and M, part 1). This account was with
the same creditor as SOR ¶ 1.m. Applicant’s spouse believes this debt stemmed from a
truck loan that they refinanced with another company, and it was paid in about August
2007 (Tr. 56–57, 71, 83–86; Exhibit G). The documentary information does not establish
payment of this account. Exhibit G is proof-of-payment for an auto loan, whereas the
2007 and 2008 credit reports identify this debt as a credit card account (Exhibits 7, 8, 9,
and M, part 1). Indeed, the January 2008 credit report indicates the account was
charged off with a past-due balance of $5,114 as of January 2008 (Exhibit M, part 1 at
5). Accordingly, this debt is unresolved. 
Applicant earns an annual salary of about $106,000, which includes a pay raise
from his recent promotion (Exhibits M and Exhibit M, part 3). His military retirement pay
is about $35,000 per year (Exhibit M, part 3). In addition, he receives VA disability pay
of about $7,640 per year (Exhibit M). In total, his 2008 annual income is estimated at
$148,640. Applicant had about $45,000 in the bank, most of it in a savings account, as
of April 7, 2008 (Exhibit M, part 4).

In addition to his income and cash in the bank, Applicant will inherit a sizeable
sum from his father’s estate (Tr. 133–135; Exhibits M and M, part 5). He, along with his
two sisters, will receive a one-third share of the estate, which consists of a home, 150
acres of land, life insurance proceeds, certificates of deposit, and a couple of vehicles.
His share could be anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000.
Applicant takes responsibility for the financial problems. He attributes the
problems to being too detached, spending too much time on his career and his military
duties and not enough time on his family responsibilities. He is now more involved with
the family finances, as he and his wife are discussing bills as they arrive, putting money
into a savings account, and planning on participating in a 401(k) account (Tr. 132–133).
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an4
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any5
existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any
level and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order6
10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting7
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An8
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate9

burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme10
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11
The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination13
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically14
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be15
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. His history raises security concerns because it indicates inability to

 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 17
 Revised Guidelines at 14. 18

satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of16 17
Guideline F. As a retired Army officer and former commanding officer, Applicant knows
that he is ultimately responsible for his family’s finances. While the mission is of key
importance, living in the real world means real-world problems, including financial
problems. Applicant was far too detached and irresponsible in his duty—as both a
military officer and husband—to keep his financial house in good order. He is still a bit
tone deaf in this regard, as evidenced by the four unresolved debts, the lack of
complete documentation in this case, and by placing too much of the responsibility for
the finances on his wife. Taken together, these circumstances call into question
Applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.
The guideline provides that certain conditions may mitigate security concerns,
and those conditions are as follows:
MC 1–the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; 
MC 2–the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
MC 3–the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
MC 4–the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
MC 5–the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
MC 6–the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.18
Based on the record evidence as a whole, MC 1, MC 3, and MC 4 apply in Applicant’s
favor; the others do not. The applicable MC are discussed below. 
9
MC 1 applies because Applicant’s financial problems began some years ago
during 2001–2003 when Applicant’s wife suffered from depression, mismanaged the
family finances, and Applicant was too detached to be fully aware of the situation.
Those circumstances are unlikely to repeat because Applicant is no longer serving in
the Army with its demands, he is more involved in the family finances, and his wife is no
longer suffering from depression. The financial problems do not cast doubt on his
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because he has resolved 10 of the
14 debts. And he has more than sufficient means to resolve the four unresolved debts
should additional payments be required.
MC 3 applies because there are clear indications that the problems are being
resolved and are under control. He resolved 10 of the 14 debts. His current financial
condition is stable and under control. He has a six-figure annual income, money in the
bank, and more money to come via the inheritance. He is not overextended nor living
beyond his means. His overall financial condition has measurably improved.
MC 4 applies because he took positive steps to resolve his financial problems by
resolving 10 of the 14 debts. Although four debts are unresolved, his actions to date are
sufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort.
To sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying
and mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing. First, Applicant is 48
years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances, bill
paying, and money-management practices. Second, Applicant and his wife may believe
they have resolved all the debts at issue in the SOR, but the record evidence is
inconclusive. Resolving all the debts may require further payments or cleaning up a
credit report, but work remains and it appears Applicant is motivated to do it. And third,
Applicant has more than two decades of honorable military service as a topnotch Army
officer (Exhibits A and B). This circumstance strongly suggests that he has the requisite
self-control, good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protest classified
information. In other words, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress
in a security-clearance context is remote. 
After weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did present sufficient
evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not present a
perfect case in mitigation, but it is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This
case is decided for Applicant. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1n: For Applicant
10
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
