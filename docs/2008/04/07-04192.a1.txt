APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES

FOR APPLICANT

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On July 26,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On January 17, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.
Loughran denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal
pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse security
clearance decision is supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Board should take
official notice of certain documents submitted for the first time on appeal; and whether the Judge’s
adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error,
we affirm.
The Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had six delinquent debts, totaling
$19,691.  The record contained no evidence that these debts had been paid.  Applicant admitted each
of these debts in her answer to the SOR, though for two of them, one for $8,948 and another for
$4,035, Applicant stated she did not remember the debts.  She had experienced some unemployment
from February 2001 until November 2002.  She has approximately $5,000 in a savings account and
about $200,000 in a 401(k).  
 The Board has examined Applicant’s allegations of error in light of the entire record.  We
conclude that the Judge’s material findings of security concern are based upon substantial record
evidence.  See Directive  ¶ E3.1.32.1. (Substantial evidence is “such relevant evidence as a
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary
evidence in the record.”)  Applicant has requested that the Board to take official notice of certain
documents.  These documents constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive
¶ E3.1.29.  See also ISCR Case No. 06-22871 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2008).  In any event, the
matters which Applicant has submitted do not constitute newly discovered evidence.  Rather, they
are documents that were readily discoverable through the exercise of due diligence prior to the close
of record.  See ISCR Case No. 06-22581 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).  See also Girault v. U.S., 135
F. Supp. 521, 524 (U.S. Ct. of Cl. 1956).  In view of the fact that Applicant has $200,000 in her
retirement account and nevertheless has not paid off her remaining delinquent debt, the Board
concludes that there is little chance that, had the documents in question been provided to the Judge,
he would have issued a different decision.
Viewed in the light of the record as a whole, the Judge’s decision articulates “a satisfactory
explanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found” and his
adverse decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  The record supports
the Judge’s conclusion that Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion that it is “clearly
consistent with national security” for her to have a clearance.  Decision at 7.  See Department of the
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge’s decision
is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
