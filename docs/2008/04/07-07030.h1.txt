HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP), on February 1, 2006. On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for 
Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On October 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on 
December 28, 2007. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on January 
3, 2008. On January 9, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing 
for January 30, 2008.  The case was transferred to me on January 16, 2008. On 
January 22, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, rescheduling the case for February 
7, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which 
 
2 
 
 
were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5 without objection. The Applicant 
offered 19 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A – S without 
objection. Applicant and his wife, who also served as his personal representative 
testified.  The record was held open until March 1, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit 
additional evidence. On March 4, 2008, Applicant requested an additional delay and the 
record was held open until March 21, 2008. Applicant timely submitted a two-page 
document which was admitted as AE T without objection. The transcript was received 
on February 19, 2008. The record closed on March 21, 2008. Based upon a review of 
the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 Applicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing within 15 days as required by ¶ 
E3.1.8 of the Directive.  He waived the 15 day advance notice. (Tr at 7.) 
 
 On February 4, 2008, the Government submitted a motion to amend the SOR by 
adding the following subparagraph under Guideline F:  
 
 1.h. A California State Tax Lien was filed against you on or about 
 September 13, 2007, in the approximate amount of $9,456. As of 
 February 4, 2008, this lien has not been satisfied. 
 
 Applicant was served a copy of the motion to amend. At hearing, Applicant did 
not object to the motion.  The SOR was amended. Applicant admitted to the new 
allegation. (Tr at 15-16.)    
 
 Later in the hearing, the Government motioned to amend the SOR in accordance 
with ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive to add the following allegation: 
 
 1.i.  You failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
 2002 through 2006. 
 
Applicant did not object and the motion to amend was granted. (Tr at 107-108.)  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, and denied the allegation in ¶ 2.a.  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor 
seeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a local area network 
administrator with the defense contractor since September 2005. He is married and has 
three children, a daughter, age 20, and a son, age 25, from a prior marriage, and an 
eight-year-old daughter with his current wife. (Tr at 21; Gov 1.)

On February 1, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to the question 27(c) “In the last 7 years, 
have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other 
debts?”, Applicant answered “No.” In response to questions in Section 28 of e-QIP 
related to financial delinquencies, Applicant answered “Yes” and listed a credit card with 
a $10,000 balance that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Gov 1.)  
 
A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  
delinquent accounts:  a $221 account that was more than 180 days delinquent (SOR ¶ 
1.a); a $10,628 charged off credit account (SOR ¶ 1.b); a $264 account that was more 
than 180 days delinquent (SOR ¶ 1.c); a $3,058 state tax lien recorded against 
Applicant for tax year 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.d); and a $5,183 state tax lien recorded against 
Applicant for tax year 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Gov 3.)  A credit report, dated February 4, 
2008, revealed an additional state tax lien in the amount of $9,456 filed against 
Applicant on September 13, 2007. (Gov 4.)   
 
In February 1997, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection. His dischargeable debts were discharged in May 1997. (¶¶ 1.f and 1.g; Gov 
5.)  State and federal tax debts were listed in the bankruptcy. Applicant’s wife states that 
these were her tax debts which existed prior to their marriage in June 1996. (Tr at 49-
50.) They did not attend any financial counseling in conjunction with the bankruptcy. (Tr 
at 50.)  
    
The bankruptcy was the result of an on-the-job injury suffered by Applicant in 
1995. He was out of work due to the injury for approximately a year and a half from 
September 1996 to December 1998.  He had surgery in September 1997. Applicant’s 
income went from $60,000 per year to $200 per week during this time. (Tr at 39-41; Gov 
1, section 11, items 11 and 12.)  
 
After his injury, Applicant attended training in the computer career field. He 
completed school in November 1998. He began his new career field at the bottom level 
doing temporary work for various agencies. He took six months off after his daughter 
was born in April 1999 because his wife earned more income at the time. (Tr at 44.) 
Between January 2001 and December 2004, he had no breaks in employment. (Tr at 
45.)  
 
In 2002, Applicant’s father-in-law was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer.  He 
resided in another state.  In December 2004, Applicant and his wife moved to that other 
state to care for him.  His father-in-law passed away in December 2004 but they still 
followed through with their move. After moving, Applicant was unemployed for several 
months between January 2005 to April 2005.  He worked for two other companies 
before obtaining a job with his current employer in September 2005. (Tr at  45-46, 105-
106; Gov 1 at Section 11.)  
 
In his response to interrogatories, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant indicated that  
he and his wife were taking out a home equity loan in order to pay the debts off. (Gov 
 
4 
 
 
2.) They refinanced the home in the amount of $50,000 in September 2007.  They used 
the money to resolve several of the debts alleged in the SOR and pay down credit card 
balances. Approximately $18,000 is left over which they intend to apply towards 
resolving their tax issues. (Tr at 102-103; AE G; AE H.) Applicant currently has 
approximately $1,500 to $1,800 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 99.) 
 
The current status of the debts are: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a: Gas bill for $221.  Account was settled and paid in full on October 3, 
2007. (Tr at 55-56; AE D; AE N; Gov 4 at 1.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b: $10,628 charged off credit card account. Account was settled for 
$9,091 on September 17, 2007. (Tr at 56-57, 62-63; AE C; AE F; AE M; Gov 4 at 2.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c: $264 account. Applicant disputes this account. He does not 
recognize the account.  He formally disputed the account to the credit bureaus on 
October 5, 2007.  He has not received a response to the formal dispute. (Tr at 63 – 67; 
Gov 3 at 5; AE E; AE F.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d:  $3,058 state tax lien for tax year 2002.  Applicant’s wife arranged to 
have an accountant friend do their taxes for tax years 2002 and 2003. They believed 
that they were under an extension. They discovered in 2003 that the accountant did not 
file their taxes.  On September 17, 2007, they paid the state tax lien. (Tr at 68-75; AE B; 
AE K.) They still have not filed tax returns for 2002 or 2003 but anticipate a refund when 
they file. (Tr at 80-81.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e: $5,183 state tax lien for tax year 2003. Explanation same as the 
immediate paragraph above pertaining to SOR ¶ 1.d. On September 17, 2007, they 
paid the state tax lien. (Tr at 68-75; AE B; AE K.)  They still have not filed tax returns for 
2002 or 2003 but anticipate a refund when they file. (Tr at 80-81.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h:  $9,456 state tax lien for tax year 2004. They have not filed tax 
returns for tax year 2004. The state tax lien has not been resolved. (Tr at 75-78; AE S.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i: Applicant admits that they have not filed state or federal tax returns for 
tax years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Tr at 78-88.) After the hearing, Applicant 
submitted a document indicating that they retained a certified public accountant on 
March 11, 2008, to handle all tax issues. (AE T.)  
 
Applicant states that he was never aware of the tax issues until they were 
addressed during his background investigation. The state tax liens were first raised in 
June 2007, when Applicant was sent interrogatories to answer pertaining to the tax 
issue. His wife later informed him of the other tax issues. (Tr at 72, 82-88.) Applicant’s 
wife accepts full responsibility for the tax problems. She claims that she was responsible 
for filing and paying the taxes and kept telling Applicant that everything was fine. (Tr at 
20, 76.) 
 
5 
 
 
 
Applicant’s recent performance evaluations indicate that he meets or exceeds 
standards.  (AE P.)  The facilities manager of one of Applicant’s former employers has 
known Applicant for several years and states he has a “high degree of integrity, 
responsibility, and ambition.” Other co-workers describe him as dependable, honest and 
hard working. Three close personal friends wrote letters on his behalf describing similar 
attributes. (AE Q.)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
 
6 
 
 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations); and FC DC ¶ 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply to Applicant’s case. 
Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations. In 1997, he filed for Chapter 
7 bankruptcy. After his bankruptcy, Applicant incurred three delinquent consumer 
accounts with an approximate balance of $11,113.  In addition to the consumer debt 
Applicant incurred three state tax liens for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004, totaling 
approximately $17,697.  There may be additional tax debt. It was revealed during the 
hearing that Applicant and his wife have not filed federal and state tax returns for tax 
years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006.   
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility going back to 1997. Although 
Applicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e and formally 
disputes the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, his tax issues remain unresolved. He still owes 
the $9,456 tax lien for tax year 2004. Although he became aware of the tax issues in 
June 2007, his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2002-2006 were not filed at 
 
7 
 
 
the close of the record. After the hearing, an accountant was retained to assist in 
resolving his tax issues but no steps had been taken to resolve the matter.   
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant’s period of 
unemployment as a result of his on-the-job injury which resulted in the Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. However, it cannot be concluded that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances with regards to his federal and state income taxes. Applicant’s wife 
accepts full responsibility for the tax problems. However, Applicant could have taken 
more proactive steps to insure his state and federal income taxes were being filed. For 
this reason, FC MC ¶ 20(b) is given less weight.    
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial 
counseling.  While several of the debts are resolved, Applicant’s state and federal tax 
returns for tax years 2002-2006 were not filed at the close of the record and it is unlikely 
the tax issues will be resolved in the near future.   
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part, with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.a. 1.b. 
1.d, and 1.e. However, Applicant’s state and federal tax problems remain. The $9,456 
state tax lien alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h was not resolved even though Applicant apparently 
had money available from his home refinancing.  Applicant became aware that he had 
tax issues in June 2007.  He took no action until after the close of the record, more than 
five months later, to retain an accountant to assist with his tax problems.     
 
 FC MC ¶20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) does not apply.  Although Applicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, he 
did not formally dispute the debt until after the SOR was issued. This issue remained 
unresolved at the close of the record.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG &15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
 
8 
 
 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 Personal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his state 
tax liens for tax years 2002 and 2003 in response to section 27(c) on his e-QIP 
application. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition ¶ 17(a) (deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies to this 
allegation. Applicant claims he was unaware of the tax liens. He claims he was not 
aware of the tax issues until he was sent interrogatories in June 2007. There is nothing 
in the record evidence indicating that he was aware of the state tax liens when he filled 
out the e-QIP application on September 14, 2006. I find Applicant did not deliberately 
withhold this information when filling out his security clearance questionnaire.  I find for 
Applicant with respect to the personal conduct concern.   
   
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s favorable 
work evaluations, reference letters, and his efforts to resolve some of the accounts.  I 
also considered Applicant’s past financial problems which resulted in his filing for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 and his unresolved state and federal tax issues. Despite, 
his wife’s claims that she is responsible for the tax problems, Applicant should have 
been more proactive in ensuring that his state and federal tax returns were filed. Once 
he discovered the tax issues in June 2007, he took no steps to file his federal and state 
tax returns over a period of five months. He did not retain an accountant to assist with 
the matter until after the hearing. At the close of the record, the state and federal tax 
returns for tax years 2002-2006 still had not been filed.    
 
 
9 
 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant    
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
   
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
