HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 18, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On March 
25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
                                                          
1Item 4. There is no allegation of falsification of her SF 86.   
 
2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Mar. 25, 2008). Item I is the source for the facts in 
the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. 
 
 
2 
 
 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified 
and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).4 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On April 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to 
have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 29, 2008, was provided to her, 
and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.5 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 
days. On July 7, 2008, the case was assigned to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o-1.aa, 
1.ac, 1.ag, and 1.ai. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is 45 years old.6 She married in 1979 and divorced in 1983. She 
married in 1984 and divorced in 1998. She is not currently married. Her children were 
born in 1981, 1983 and 1985. She did not serve in the military. She attended junior 
college for several months in 2000. She has been employed for a defense contractor in 
security operations since November 2006. She has worked as a park associate from 
October 2002 to April 2006. She has no police record. She has not used illegal drugs in 
the last seven years, and has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position.  
 
                                                          
3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
4 When she completed her SF 86, she denied she had any unpaid judgments in the last seven 
years, and any liens against her property. See Item 4, Sections 27c and 27d. She admitted filing for 
bankruptcy in the last seven years, and her pay was garnished in September 2003. See Item 4, Sections 
27a and 27b. She also admitted having debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years; and  
having debts currently delinquent over 90 days. See Item 4, Sections 28a and 28b.     
 
5Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated May 2, 2008; and 
Applicant’s receipt is signed and dated May 5, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that 
she had 30 days after Applicant’s receipt to submit information. 
 
6Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless 
stated otherwise.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant admitted in her SOR response at ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, that her budget 
showed a monthly net remainder of negative $51, and that her debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2001 (Item 3). She denied 
responsibility for the 13 debts totaling $19,411 as listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($5,409), 1.d 
($678), 1.e ($777), 1.f ($602), 1.g ($1,197), 1.j ($678), 1.k ($111), 1.n ($5,935), 1.ab 
($79), 1.ad ($2,600), 1.ae ($70), 1.af ($79), and 1.ah ($1,196) (Item 3).  She admitted 
responsibility for the 20 debts totaling $11,579, as detailed in SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($122), 1.i 
($156), 1.l ($128), 1.m ($5,935), 1.o ($286), 1.p ($570), 1.q ($554), 1.r ($1,170), 1.s 
($447), 1.t ($227), 1.u ($26), 1.v ($45), 1.w ($65), 1.x ($169), 1.y ($47), 1.z ($31), 1.aa 
($85), 1.ac ($41), 1.ag ($1,247), and 1.ai ($228) (Item 3).   
 
Applicant’s budget showed a gross monthly salary of $1,120, $400 from a 
boyfriend and $364 monthly from spousal support (Item 5). Her monthly net income is 
$1,763 and her expenses total $1,490 (Item 5). She pays $100 monthly on a $15,000 
debt and $212 on a $2,186 debt (Item 5). Her budget did not allocate funds to pay the 
SOR debts. A significant portion of her delinquent debts resulted from medical 
treatments she received (Item 5).    
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
 
4 
 
 
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”7 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
                                                          
7 See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” ISCR 
Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “Substantial evidence” is 
“more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 
F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
8 “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”

protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her SOR 
response, and her response to interrogatories. After her delinquent debts were 
discharged in 2001, she accrued 20 additional delinquent debts, totaling approximately 
$11,579. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) 
because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent 
debts.9 She receives partial mitigating credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because many of her 
                                                          
9“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).

debts resulted from medical treatment and as such constitute a condition largely beyond 
her control.   
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received some financial 
counseling in connection with her 2001 bankruptcy. However, there are not “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” There is insufficient 
information to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge obtained from financial 
counseling or that she showed good faith10 in the resolution of her debts. 
 
I find “For Applicant” for all the debts she denied in her SOR response in the 
decretal paragraph of this decision. There is insufficient evidence contradicting her 
denials to prove her responsibility for those debts.  Moreover, some of them are likely 
duplications of the debts she admitted. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable to the debts she 
admitted because those particular debts are not disputed. She did not provide 
“documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue” with respect to the debts she admitted.   
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient correspondence with her creditors for the 
debts she admitted to establish she acted responsibly and in good faith. She failed to 
arrange payment plans (although from her budget she does not have sufficient income 
remaining to generate payments plans). Her overall conduct with her creditors casts 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her financial 
problems are continuing and likely to recur. She should have been more diligent and 
made greater efforts to resolve her delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR. 
She has not carried her burden of proving her financial responsibility. Based on my 
evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully 
apply. 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  
 
 
7 
 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).   
Applicant’s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence 
of any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal 
issue), she is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, 
rehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall amount of her delinquent debt at about 
$11,579 is relatively low.  
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct is more substantial. Her 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 provided her with the knowledge and opportunity for a 
fresh financial start. She was well aware of her financial responsibilities. She learned of 
the security significance of these delinquent debts when she received the SOR. Her 
efforts to resolve her delinquent debts were insufficient to fully resolve security 
concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts 
and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated 
the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”11 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is not eligible for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant

Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.l and 1.m: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.n:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.o to 1.aa: Against Applicant

Subparagraphs 1.ad to 1.af: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.ag:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.ah:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.ai:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
