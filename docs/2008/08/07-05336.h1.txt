RIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to show sufficient financial responsibility to mitigate security 
concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 13, 2005, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application 
(SF 86). On November 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under 
 
1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                            
Guideline F (Financial Considerations).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Applicant responded to the SOR on 
December 26, 2007 and requested a hearing before and Administrative Judge. 
 
 DOHA received the case on February 14, 2008, and assigned it to me that same 
day. Applicant requested a delay in the hearing from March 10 to March 18, 2008 (Tr. 
9). The hearing was conducted as rescheduled on March 28, 2008. I admitted five 
government exhibits (GE 1-5; Tr. 17-21), and three Applicant Exhibits (AE 1-3). 
Applicant made an oral statement during her hearing and called two witnesses. DOHA 
received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 9, 2008.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.e, and provided releases of the 
federal tax liens pertaining to SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b (Tr. 10-11). Her admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is 52 years old (Tr. 126).3 She has never been married (Tr. 126). Her 
children are ages 11 and 20 years old (Tr. 126). She completed three years of college 
(Tr. 127).  
 
 Applicant currently works for a contractor providing services to a federal agency, 
(ensuring compliance with statutes) and attending some interagency meetings (Tr. 45). 
She has worked for this agency since 2000, but for the first few years she worked in the 
travel section monitoring credit cards and account information (Tr. 47-48). She currently 
processes federal register notifications and charter renewals (Tr. 45). She never has 
had access to classified information in the past and does not require access to 
classified information now (Tr. 45). She currently has an ADP-type public trust position 
(Tr. 46). She submitted her security clearance application in January 2005 because her 
project manager told her to do so (Tr. 47). Her employment was contingent on 
continued approval of her ADP clearance for her public trust position (Tr. 47). When she 
 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
2  When she completed her SF 86, Applicant denied that in the last seven years she had filed for 
bankruptcy, had any property repossessed, had any wages garnished, and had any unpaid judgments. 
See GE 1, Questions 33, 34, 35 and 37. She listed the two large federal tax liens and two debts that were 
over 180 days delinquent. See GE 1, Questions 36 and 38.    
 
3  Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless 
stated otherwise.

received the SOR, she was advised that revocation of her public trust clearance was a 
possibility (Tr. 47).     
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR listed five debts totaling $50,673. She settled and paid SOR debt 1.d in 
the amount of $535 (AE 1). The other four debts were not paid; however, the two largest 
debts became unenforceable because of the passage of time (AE 2). She promised to 
try to resolve the remaining two enforceable debts. Those five debts will be addressed 
in the order they appear in the SOR. 
 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien against Applicant in the amount of 
$41,493 in March 2003 in connection with tax years 1993 and 1994 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and in 
the amount of $6,013 on March 20, 1996 in connection with tax years 1989-1991 (SOR 
¶ 1.b).  Applicant provided releases for the taxes owed, dated December 17, 2007 (AE 
2). The releases indicated the following amounts were owed as of the IRS assessment 
dates: 
 
SOR ¶ Tax Year Date of Assessment Unpaid Balance of 
Assessment 
1.b 1989 July 18, 1994 $3,286.56 
1.b 1990 October 18, 1994 $2,396.20 
1.b 1991 April 4, 1994 $331.09 
1.a 1993 August 25, 1997 $21,029.09 
1.a 1994 August 25, 1997 $20,464.35 
  Total: $47,507.29 
 
Applicant did not file her 1993 and 1994 taxes when she was required to do so 
(Tr. 134-135). Later, Applicant’s sister recommended that Ms. E assist with filing 
Applicant’s tax returns for 1993 and 1994 (Tr. 50, 74). Applicant was unsure when her 
1993 and 1994 tax returns were actually filed (Tr. 135-136). She was also unsure about 
whether her tax returns for 1989, 1990, and 1991 were filed on time or not (Tr. 136). 
These returns contained false information, which was discovered in an IRS audit (Tr. 
50). Everyone who had taxes filed by Ms. E had their returns audited (Tr. 75). Ms. E 
would just make “up stuff” for tax returns (Tr. 76). Applicant was not sure whether she 
paid any taxes in 1993 and 1994 (Tr. 76). She did not closely review the tax returns Ms. 
E prepared for her (Tr. 79). She thought Ms. E signed some tax returns for her (Tr. 
137).4  
In 1994, Applicant’s gross income was about $58,303 and her taxable income 
was $5,170 (Tr. 87-89). Her 1994 tax return showed a refund of $499 (Tr. 89). It was 
signed on November 15, 1995 (Tr. 152). Eventually the IRS filed a lien for 1994 in the 
                                            
4  Applicant’s 1994 tax return has Applicant’s signature on it; however, it may not have been 
signed by Ms. E (Tr. 139). It did not have Ms. E’s address in the address of preparer section (Tr. 139). 
She insisted Ms. E prepared some of her tax returns; however, she was unsure about which tax returns 
Ms. E prepared for her (Tr. 140, 153). 
 
 
4 
 
                                           
amount of $20,464 (which included interest and penalties) (Tr. 90, 123; AE 2). At the 
time the IRS filed the tax lien Applicant was unemployed, and had a new baby (Tr. 92).5  
 
In 2001, Applicant hired a company that helped with tax issues, paying them 
$400 monthly; however, they did not help with her tax problems (Tr. 51, 56, 141). She 
paid the company a total of about $2,500 (Tr. 142).6 The company did not refund any of 
her payments (Tr. 57). She did not file a complaint against the company (Tr. 142).  
 
In 2002, Applicant sought assistance from Ms. A (Tr. 140) and refilled her taxes 
with the assistance of Ms. A (Tr. 78-79). She said Ms. A helped with taxes for tax years 
1996 to 2004 (Tr. 142-143). Applicant indicated at one point she was unsure about 
whether Ms. A had refilled her tax returns (Tr. 93), and about which tax returns Ms. A 
refilled for her (Tr. 154). She said she did not understand taxes (Tr. 75). She claimed 
she contacted the IRS several times over the years about her taxes (Tr. 94-95). When 
she had her interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management, 
she promised to contact the IRS about her taxes and make arrangements to resolve her 
debts (Tr. 95-96). She did not contact the IRS after 2002 because Ms. A told her not to 
do so (Tr. 144). When she completed her SF 86 on January 13, 2005, she said she 
planned to resolve her tax problems in 2005 (GE 1 at Question 43). On August 2, 2007, 
she promised to pay her tax debts using funds from refinancing her rental property (GE 
3). Between 2001 and April 2008, she did not contact the IRS until 2007 (Tr. 144). 
When she contacted the IRS in 2007, the IRS informed her that the two tax liens had 
been released because 10 years elapsed without the taxes being paid (Tr. 58-61, 124, 
143; AE 2). 7   
 
Applicant owed $6,013 for an IRS lien filed on March 20, 1996 in connection with 
tax years 1989 to 1991 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant said the IRS garnished one of her 
checks (Tr. 76). She also said she paid the IRS $6,000 before she lost her job; 
however, she claimed the IRS refused to give her documentation to show the payment 
 
5  Later she clarified that she was under employed in 1996. The amount of work she received 
from her employer was significantly reduced, and there was a corresponding reduction in her income (Tr. 
98-99). She was unemployed for about two months around May 2002 (Tr. 133). 
 
6  Page 2 of a company statement, dated November 12, 2002, lists payments from four checks 
totaling $1,700 (AE 3). However, the same statement also indicates from April 17, 2001, to March 20, 
2002, Applicant paid $3,100 into the company account for resolving her delinquent taxes (AE 3).  
Applicant did not provide page 1 of the company statement. 
 
7  A levy must be made or proceeding in court begun to collect a federal tax lien within 10 years 
after a tax assessment is made. See 26 U.S.C. § 6502; United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 119 
(2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding, see United 
States v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d 796 (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see 
United States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or 
after Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. Id. There was no evidence of record about levies, judicial collection 
actions, agreements, offers in compromise, or bankruptcy. As indicated in the IRS releases, the collection 
of the 1994 and 1997 federal tax liens were barred by the 10-year statute of limitations in 2004 and 2007, 
respectively.    
    
 
 
5 
 
                                           
(Tr. 77). She also said the IRS did not have documentation showing the $6,000 
payment (Tr. 97). She said she could not find her documentation on the payment (Tr. 
97). As indicated previously, the IRS lien was released in 2007 (GE 2). 
 
Applicant owed the IRS $1,000 for her 2004 taxes (SOR ¶ 1.c; Tr. 102-104). The 
$1,000 debt pertained to her failure to provide proper documentation to support her 
child care credit or deduction (Tr. 145). She had another tax debt from 2005 in the 
amount of $558 (Tr. 104, 148). She had a problem with her income tax for 2004 that 
was unresolved concerning documentation from one of the companies where she 
worked (Tr. 122). She is working with the IRS to straighten out the documentation (Tr. 
123). The IRS will not start a payment plan until Applicant provides complete 
documentation to show how much she owes (Tr. 146). After her car is paid off in May 
2008, she plans to start paying the IRS $500 a month (Tr. 101). She was unsure about 
when she first learned about her problem with her 2004 taxes (Tr. 145). Her most recent 
contact with the IRS was on March 21, 2008 (Tr. 147). At the time of her hearing, she 
was working with the IRS towards resolution of this debt (Tr. 62, 100). 
 
Applicant owed a collection agency $535 for a telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.d). 
About four years ago, Applicant signed a contract for a cell phone account on behalf of 
her son, who was 16 (Tr. 62, 108, 148).8 Shortly after receiving the phone, her 
residence was burglarized and the phone was stolen (Tr. 62). Applicant had a 
settlement offer, dated February 8, 2008, for $267.51 for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d (AE 1, 2; 
Tr. 54).  She paid this debt (Tr. 64). 
 
In regard to the judgment for $1,632 in SOR ¶ 1.e, Applicant explained she had 
lost her job, and had just had a baby (Tr. 65). She was unable to pay her rent and 
moved out of her apartment (Tr. 65). She informed the landlord about her inability to pay 
the rent (Tr. 65). Applicant went to court in 1997 and contested the debt (Tr. 105). In 
1997, the landlord obtained a judgment for $1,632 (Tr. 104). She has been aware of this 
judgment for 11 years (Tr. 105). She paid $100 to her former landlord (Tr. 150-151). 
The landlord now wants $3,000 to resolve this debt (Tr. 66). She called the creditor in 
August 2007, and the week before her hearing about compromising the debt (Tr. 67). 
She was willing to pay this debt (Tr. 66).   
 
From 1995 to 2004, Applicant’s annual income has been in the $50,000 to 
$60,000 range (Tr. 123). Applicant’s current annual salary is $69,000 (Tr. 67). After 
making debt and expense payments, she has about $300 a month remaining (Tr. 117). 
She financially supports her 11-year-old daughter and 20-year old son, who is in school 
(Tr. 67). Her daughter attends a private school, and Applicant borrowed $1,300 for 
tuition from her IRA and $1,200 from a credit union (Tr. 68-69). She had difficulty 
borrowing money earlier (Tr. 111). She bought a 2001 Volvo in 2002 for $25,000 (Tr. 
 
8  When discussing her son and his cell phone, she said, “Well I was going to say the cell phone 
because my son had been robbed going to school. So, a man robbed him of his bicycle.” (Tr. 149). She 
wanted her son to pay for the cell phone account because that would teach him about being financially 
responsible (Tr. 149). 
 
 
6 
 
113). Her remaining car loan debt of $829 will be paid off in May 2008 (Tr. 68, 113).  
She and her mother purchased a rental property in 1979, and paid it off in December 
2004 (Tr. 115-116). The tenants damaged her rental property (Tr. 116-117). Over the 
last several years, her strategy for paying her tax debts centered on using rent from her 
rental property; however she had problems obtaining the rent (Tr. 118). Otherwise she 
is debt free (Tr. 69). 
 
Applicant’s 2007 credit report shows some debts for credit cards taken out 
without her permission (Tr. 69-70). She has contacted the credit reporting company to 
have her credit report corrected (Tr. 70). She paid the other debts indicated on the 2007 
credit report (Tr. 70-72). She paid a large medical debt resulting from treatments around 
her baby’s birth in 1997 (there was a judgment for $12,187) (Tr. 106-107). She thought 
the amount of the judgment was a mistake (Tr. 107). She provided a letter dated 
November 1, 2002, indicating this medical debt was paid (SOR response). She received 
about six weeks of credit counseling in late 2007 (Tr. 72-73, 114-115).     
 
Character Witnesses 
 
Ms. S has worked for a federal agency for 19 years (Tr. 33). Ms. S worked 
closely with Applicant for four years (Tr. 25). She has daily contact with Applicant and 
their offices adjoin each other (Tr. 26). They occasionally go to lunch together, but 
otherwise do not socialize away from the office (Tr. 31). Applicant does not currently 
require a Secret clearance, but still requires her public trust clearance (Tr. 28). Applicant 
ensures agency compliance with federal laws (Tr. 25). Although Ms. S was aware of 
Applicant’s financial problems, she considers Applicant to be highly reliable and 
completely trustworthy (Tr. 28-29).  
 
Ms. T has worked for a federal agency for six years involving billing and 
expenses on agency-related credit cards (Tr. 36-37). Beginning in 2002, she worked in 
the same office with Applicant (Tr. 37). Ms. T has daily interaction with Applicant (Tr. 
38). Applicant was involved in the processing of travel bills (Tr. 37). Applicant had 
access to sensitive, personal financial information (Tr. 38). If Applicant had abused the 
information provided, that abuse would have surfaced, and no such abuse was 
disclosed or discovered (Tr. 38). Ms. T did not believe Applicant was living beyond her 
means (Tr. 39). Applicant has solid integrity and is a trustworthy person (Tr. 39). 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s controlling 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”9 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
 
9  See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable 
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” 
ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “Substantial 
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit 
Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
10  “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.” 
ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).

Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides four Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts, . . . (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, . . . 
[and] (g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or 
the fraudulent filing of the same.” 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her 
SOR response, her response to interrogatories, and her statement at her hearing. In 
1994, the IRS determined she owed about $6,000 for her federal taxes. These taxes 
were never paid and they became legally uncollectible in 2004. In 1997, the IRS 
assessed her tax debt for 1993 and 1994 at over $40,000. These taxes were never paid 
and they became legally uncollectible in 2007. She did not file her taxes on time, and 
conceded her tax return in 1994 contained “made-up” information. She has a judgment 
that has been unresolved since 1997. She has federal income taxes that are unresolved 
from 2004 and 2005. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(c) and 19(g).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
 
 
9 
 
                                           
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(b) 
because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent 
debts between 2002 and 2007. She was unemployed in 1997, and was underemployed 
before receiving employment in 2002 with a federal contractor. From 1994 to 2007, she 
had a substantial amount of delinquent federal income taxes. From 2002 to 2007, she 
followed Ms. A’s advice and employed a deliberate strategy not to contact the IRS 
because negotiations with the IRS might extend her tax liability. See n. 9, supra.  She 
currently has unresolved debt with the IRS. Moreover, she did not make sufficient 
progress on resolution of her 1997 judgment. These factors cast doubt on Applicant’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Additionally, she did not describe 
any conditions, such as divorce, unemployment or medical treatment, which occurred 
between 2002 and her hearing, which caused her to be unable to make greater 
progress resolving her financial problems.11  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received financial counseling. 
However, there are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.” There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant applied the 
knowledge obtained from financial counseling or that she showed good faith12 in the 
resolution of her debts. 
 
11  “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). 
 
12  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                            
 
The SOR listed five debts totaling $50,673. Applicant settled and paid SOR debt 
1.d in the amount of $535 (AE 1). The other four debts were not paid; however, the two 
largest debts became unenforceable because of the passage of time (AE 2). In her 
2005 SF 86, she indicated she planned to resolve her delinquent debts. When she 
responded to DOHA interrogatories on August 2, 2007, she promised to try to resolve 
the remaining two enforceable debts; however, she did not establish payment plans for 
her remaining IRS debts or on her 1997 judgment. Her efforts are insufficient to mitigate 
financial concerns pertaining to these two debts. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate 
the SOR debts because these two unpaid and unresolved debts are not disputed. She 
did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue” with respect to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 
1.e.   
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient correspondence with her creditors for SOR 
debts ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.e to establish she acted responsibly and in good faith. She 
failed to provide proof of payment plans. Her overall conduct with her creditors casts 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her financial 
problems are continuing and likely to recur. She should have been more diligent and 
made greater efforts to resolve her delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR. 
She has not carried her burden of proving her financial responsibility. Based on my 
evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully 
apply. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).   
Applicant’s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence 
of any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal 
issue), she is a law-abiding citizen. She does not abuse drugs, and has no criminal 
record. The overall amount of her delinquent, enforceable debt at about $3,000 is 
relatively low. She paid one SOR debt. She filed all tax returns from 1995 to present. 
Some of her financial problems were caused by unemployment and underemployment. 
She paid a cell phone-related delinquent debt in March 2008, and a large medical debt 
in 2002. She completed financial counseling. These factors show significant 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.   
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct for security clearance 
purposes is more substantial. She has three years of college, and has worked 
monitoring travel accounts and credit cards. She is 52 years old with a wealth of job-
related experiences. She received financial counselling, and has sufficient knowledge to 
budget, and file accurate and complete tax returns. From 1994 to 2007, she owed more 
than $40,000 to the IRS, and she admits she did not pay the IRS anything to resolve 
these delinquent taxes. Nor did her evidence establish any efforts to settle or negotiate 
a payment plan. For the last five years, she has been paid by a federal contractor. Her 
salary was funded by other taxpayers, who dutifully paid their taxes. She is well aware 
of her tax-paying responsibilities, yet she did little to act responsibly as a taxpayer. She 
learned of the security significance of her delinquent debts when she had her OPM 
interview. This security concern was reinforced when she responded to DOHA 
interrogatories, and again when she received the SOR. Her efforts to resolve her 
delinquent debts, especially her IRS debts, were insufficient to fully resolve security 
concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts 
and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated 
the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
 
 
 
12 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
