ANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: 
 
 After a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations.   His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing 
(EQIP) Questionnaire on April 13, 2006. On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On May 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in 
writing and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was 
 
2 
 
 
assigned to me on June 3, 2008. I convened a hearing on June 30, 2008, to consider 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced seven 
exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 7 and admitted to the record without 
objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He attached 
four exhibits to the SOR, which were identified and marked as Applicant’s Ex. A through 
D and admitted to the record without objection.  At his hearing, Applicant introduced an 
additional exhibit, which I mistakenly marked as Ex. A.  The correct identification for the 
exhibit is Ex. A-1. 
 
Department Counsel objected to the admission of Ex. A-1, stating that the 
document, which Applicant represented as a communication from a national consumer 
credit reporting organization, failed to identify Applicant and his address of record with 
specificity and failed to explain why it no longer listed two debts on Applicant’s credit 
report.  Applicant stated he offered Ex. A-1 to show that a credit repair company he had 
hired had been communicating with the consumer credit reporting organization on his 
behalf. I overruled Department Counsel’s objection and admitted Ex. A-1 for any 
probative value it might have.  
 
 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing 
the amount of the delinquent debt identified at ¶ 1.a from $1,371 to $1,361.  Department 
Counsel stated that the evidence provided at the hearing established the lesser debt.  
Applicant did not object to Department Counsel’s motion, and the SOR was amended 
accordingly.  
 
 At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of 
business July 7, 2008, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the 
record.  Applicant did not file any additional information, and I closed the record on July 
8, 2008.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July 14, 2008. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR contains 19 allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.s.)  In his Answer to the SOR, dated 
May 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008, Applicant admitted 18 of the allegations 
(¶¶ 1.a. through 1.r); he denied one allegation (¶ 1.s.) and provided documentation to 
corroborate his statement that the debt had been paid. Applicant’s admissions are 
admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 15-16, 76, 85; Ex. D.)  
 
 Applicant is 42 years old, a high school graduate, never married, and without 
children or other dependents.  From October 2005 until April 26, 2008, when his 
eligibility for a security clearance was suspended as a result of receiving the SOR, 
Applicant was employed as a security guard by a government contractor. (Ex. 1; Tr. 33, 
95-96.)   
 
 
3 
 
 
                                           
 In addition to his current unemployment, Applicant has been unemployed two 
times since graduating from high school in 1984. In 2003, he suffered a heart attack and 
was unemployed for four months.  From March 1990 to February 1991, he was laid off 
from a job and collected unemployment compensation.  (Tr. 39-41.)     
 
 When he was interviewed under oath by an authorized investigator in December 
2006, Applicant acknowledged several financial delinquencies that were not listed on 
his SF-86.  He told the investigator that his financial delinquencies were attributable to a 
six-month period of unemployment as the result of injuring his ankle in 2001 or 2002. 
Applicant reported that he had no health insurance when he was injured, and he was 
responsible for all medical expenses relating to the ankle injury, which required two 
separate surgeries and many sessions of physical therapy. During this time, Applicant 
reported, his automobile was repossessed, and he used his credit cards to support 
himself. (Ex. 3.) 
 
 At his hearing, Applicant stated that his ankle injury occurred in the 1990s and 
not in 2001 and 2002.  He stated that he no longer owed any debts related to his ankle 
injury and subsequent unemployment.1  He further stated that all of the debts alleged on 
the SOR had occurred since 2003.  (Tr. 41-45.)  
 
 The amended SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he was responsible for 
18 financial delinquencies totaling approximately $19,955.  The SOR alleged the 
following delinquencies: an unsatisfied deficiency balance of about $12,513 on an 
automobile that was repossessed and sold in July 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.e.); a debt of $1,361 
to a medical provider, referred for collection in about September 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.a.); a 
debt of $268 to a medical provider, referred for collection in about November 2001 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.); a debt of $234, referred for collection in about September 2003 (SOR ¶ 
1.d.); a debt of $45, referred for collection in about November 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a debt 
of $50, referred for collection in about May 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.g.); a medical debt of $350, 
referred for collection in about May 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.h.); a medical debt of $100, referred 
for collection in about May 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.i.); a cable debt of about $1,127, referred for 
collection in about October 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.j.); and a debt of $408 to a communications 
utility, referred for collection in about June 2006. (SOR ¶ 1.k.). 
 
 The amended SOR alleged the following additional debts: a debt of $445, 
referred for collection in about August 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.l.); a medical debt of $114, 
referred for collection in October 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.m.); a cable debt of $231, referred for 
collection in about October 2006 (¶1.n.); a medical debt of $777, referred for collection 
in about January 2007 (SOR ¶1.o.); a medical debt of $100, referred for collection in 
about August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.p.); a medical debt of $75, referred for collection in about 
 
1 Applicant later acknowledged that the debt alleged at SOR ¶1.a.arose at the time of his ankle injury. (Tr. 
52.) 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.q.); and a medical debt of $149, referred for collection in about 
August 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.r.).   
 
 In an interview with an authorized investigator in December 2006, Applicant 
stated he hired credit repair company A in July 2006 to help him resolve his financial 
delinquencies.  He told the investigator he paid credit repair company A $45 a month for 
this service.  Applicant decided Company A was not helping him, and sometime in early 
2007, he hired Company B to assist him with his financial delinquencies.  He testified he 
paid Company B $60 a month to represent him before his creditors and resolve his 
debts. He stated that Company B estimated it could resolve his debts in about one year. 
Neither Company A nor Company B has provided Applicant with credit counseling or 
assistance in developing a budget. Applicant stated he would submit as post-hearing 
documents a copy of his contract with Company B and e-mail reports from Company B 
on the status of the payment of debts it was attempting to resolve for him.  However, 
Applicant failed to provide this information.   (Ex. 3; Tr. 91, 118-121.) 
 
 Applicant had an automobile repossessed in February 2001.  He listed this 
repossession on the SF-86 he signed and certified on April 13, 2006, and he 
acknowledged this repossession in his interview with an authorized investigator in 
December 2006. In June 2002, Applicant purchased a new vehicle. The vehicle was 
repossessed in July 2004 when he failed to make the required monthly payments.  
Applicant owed a deficiency balance of $12,513 on the vehicle. He did not list this 
delinquency on his SF-86 and he did not address this debt in his interview with an 
authorized investigator in December 2006. (Ex. 3; Ex. 7; Tr. 63-70.)  
 
 Applicant purchased a new automobile in April 2005.  His monthly payments on 
the vehicle are $427.  He purchased another vehicle, a truck, in September 2007.  His 
monthly payments on the truck are $294.  (Ex. 4; Tr. 106-114.) 
 
 In August 2006, Appellant returned to live at his parents’ home for about six 
months in order to save money and satisfy some of his delinquent bills. He paid his 
parents $100 in rent each month.  He had a net remainder at the end of each month of 
about $1,600.  He told an authorized investigator that he planned to use that money to 
satisfy the debt alleged at SOR ¶1.c. and other delinquent debts. However, he gave the 
money to a friend so she could pay her bills.  He estimated that he gave his friend about 
$1,200 each month for about seven months. She has not repaid the money lent to her 
by Applicant. He did not use his monthly net remainders to pay any of his delinquent 
debts.  (Ex. 3; Tr. 102-104.) 
 
 From December 2006 to about April 2008, Appellant reported a gross monthly 
salary of $3,600 from his full-time employment.  In addition, he had a part-time job until 
January or February 2008 that paid him $160 a week.  Applicant’s net monthly income 
between December 2006 and about January 2008 was approximately $2,900.  (Tr. 95-
99.) 
  
 
5 
 
 
 Applicant reported the following monthly fixed expenses: rent: $750; groceries: 
$200; health insurance: $226; credit repair contract with Company B: $60; utilities: 
$200; cell phone: $65; automobile insurance: $172; car payment: $427: truck payment: 
$294; miscellaneous: $100.  His total fixed monthly expenses were $2,494.  (Ex 3; Tr. 
100-102, 115-116.) 
 
 Applicant’s security clearance eligibility was suspended in April 2008, and he has 
not worked for his employer since that time.  He claims $300 in monthly income and 
$380 a week in unemployment compensation, for a total monthly income of about 
$1,800.  He has no savings.  He does not have a retirement account. In his answer to 
the SOR, Applicant asserted he would pay all of his delinquent debts that were less 
than $300 by September 2008. Applicant provided evidence to corroborate his 
statement that he had paid a debt of $81 on April 28, 2008. The debt was alleged at 
SOR ¶1.s. All other debts alleged on the SOR remain unsatisfied. (Answer to SOR, 
dated May 1, 2008, May 5, 2008, and May 7, 2008; Tr. 85, 114-116.) 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an  
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
6 
 
 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable 
or unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially 
disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions 
could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant’s financial delinquencies. 
Unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it “happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
(AG ¶ 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s 
 
7 
 
 
control, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” (AG ¶ 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might 
be applicable include evidence that “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or 
is under control” (AG ¶ 20(c) or “the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” (AG ¶ 20(d))  Finally, if “the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of options to resolve the issue,” then AG ¶ 20(e) might apply.  
 
Applicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from  
September 2001 to the present time. While he suffered a heart attack in 2003 and was 
consequently unemployed for four months, he was continuously employed from October 
2005 to April 2008 in a full-time job, and he also had a part-time job until January 2008. 
His net income from his full-time and part-time jobs was approximately $2,900 a month.  
Applicant admitted that 18 of the 19 delinquencies alleged on the SOR remained 
unresolved, resulting in substantial debt which continues to the present day, a situation 
which raises concerns about Applicant’s good judgment.   
 
Applicant had not received financial counseling. While he did not dispute his 
debts and admitted that he was responsible for them, it was not clear that he 
understood his financial problems or how to resolve them.  He failed to demonstrate 
how the credit repair companies he had hired were working to resolve his financial 
delinquencies.  He failed to produce documents to corroborate his statement that credit 
repair company B was remedying his financial problems by paying his creditors on his 
behalf. He had no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt 
and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part in 
mitigation, but that AG ¶ 20(a), AG ¶ 20(c), AG ¶ 20(d) and AG 20(e) do not apply in 
mitigation to the facts of Applicant’s case. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
8 
 
 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant’s financial problems began 
several years ago and continue to the present. He has not taken affirmative action to 
pay or resolve the majority of his delinquent debts, and his many delinquencies and his 
lack of attention to them continue to raise security concerns.  He held his most recent 
job since October 2005, and he used his income to purchase an automobile and a truck. 
However, he paid only one of the 19 debts alleged on the SOR.  Despite a steady 
income for several years, he failed to budget his income to satisfy his many other debts.  
Instead, he continued on a pattern of financial over-extension, which, in the past, led to 
bad debts and vehicle repossessions. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present 
time as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his 
financial delinquencies.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST  APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r.: Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.s.:   For Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
