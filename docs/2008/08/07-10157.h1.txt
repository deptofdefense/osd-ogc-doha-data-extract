RIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate Guideline F (Financial Considerations) security 
concerns. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 8, 2006, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions or Standard Form (SF 86). On September 26, 2006, he submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86).1 On March 24, 
2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
 
1  Form Items 4 and 5 are his two SF 86s.  
 
2  Form Item 1 (SOR), is the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated 
otherwise. 
 
 
2 
 
 
                                           
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified 
and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On May 13, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to 
have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 5, 2008, was provided to him, 
and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.4 Applicant did not provide a written response to the FORM. 
The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2008. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.k 
and 1.n. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.l – 1.p because the debts were paid or he is making 
payments on the debts. He denied owing the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p. I find SOR ¶¶ 
1.n and 1.o are duplicates of the same debt. His admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make 
the following additional findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old truck driver working for a defense contractor.5 He 
married in 1981 and divorced in 1988. He married the second time in 1990. His children 
or stepchildren were born in 1979, 1980, 1983 and 1984. He did not serve in the 
military. He has no police record. He has not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, 
and has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. He has never been fired 
from a job or quit under adverse circumstances. He has never had any alcohol-related 
counseling or treatment. 
 
 
3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
4  The DOHA transmittal letter is dated June 10, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA 
transmittal letter on June 23, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days 
after receipt of the FORM to submit information. 
 
5  Items 4 and 5 (2006 SF 86s) are the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated 
otherwise.

On November 28, 2006, an Investigator from the Office of Personnel 
Management interviewed Applicant (Item 8). Applicant promised to contact all of his 
creditors listed on a credit report dated October 17, 2006, and make arrangements to 
settle all of his outstanding debts as soon as possible.  However, some of the SOR 
debts were listed on the October 17, 2006, credit report and remain unresolved. 
 
He admitted responsibility for the 12 delinquent debts he admitted in the following 
SOR paragraphs: 1.a ($124), 1.b ($310), 1.c ($241), 1.d ($85), 1.e ($105), 1.f ($150), 
1.g ($9,244), 1.h ($537), 1.i ($89), 1.j ($100), 1.k ($234), and 1.n ($91,134).6  The 
federal tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.n was entered on January 23, 2007, and released on 
December 9, 2002 (Item 13 at 8). He did not explain why the federal tax lien in SOR ¶ 
1.n was released, but it was included as an item in his September 2002 bankruptcy. 
Applicant said he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l ($738), and 1.p ($201). The debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l were listed in his bankruptcy filing (Item 10). He denied the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.q ($737) because he did not owe it. He is making payments on the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.m ($15,387). He did not provide any proof of payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.m. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($74,081) is a duplication of 1.n ($91,134).   
 
The record (Item 13) contains the following judgment and lien information: (1) 
IRS Lien for $1,967 entered in 1992 and released in 1997; (2) IRS Lien for $91,134 
entered in 1997 and released in 2002; (3) IRS Lien for $1,434 entered in 1997; (4) IRS 
Lien for $74,086 entered in 1998; (5) IRS Lien for $73,969 entered in 1998; (6) State 
Tax Lien for $8,483 renewed in 2002; (7) State Tax Lien for $737 renewed in 2001 
(SOR ¶ 1.q); (8) Small Claims Judgment for $201 entered in 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.p); and (9) 
State Tax Lien for $15,387 entered in 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.m).     
 
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2002, and his debts were 
discharged on September 24, 2002 (SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 1.s). His liabilities in the 
bankruptcy were $125,135 (Item 10 at 1, 5). Applicant probably received financial 
counseling in connection with his bankruptcy.  
  
  On February 5, 2008, Applicant responded (Item 8) to numerous interrogatories 
about the status of specific debts with a brief statement: 
 
I have not yet made arrangements on the medical bills that I owe.7 I have 
been working on getting my tax bills settled. As soon as I speak to the 
local tax representative and set up payments, I will then know how to best 
set up payments on my medical bills. . . . I will begin making payments on 
my federal taxes on January 24, 2008.  
 
 
6  Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this and the next paragraph is 
Applicant’s SOR response (Item 3).  
 
7  SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.l are for medical debts. He paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l. 
 
4 
 
 
                                           
He concluded his general statement about his debts, commenting that he has hired a 
tax consultant and begun arrangements to pay his tax debt. Attached to this response 
was a statement from the IRS about an established payment plan of $200 monthly for 
tax years 1991 and 1992 until the specifics of the repayment plan could be completed 
(Item 8). As indicated previously, the IRS released his tax debts for 1991 and 1992 in 
2002. 
 
Applicant and his spouse’s 2006 budget showed a gross monthly salary of 
$5,933, deductions of $1,075, expenses of $1,352, debt payments of $1,339 and a net 
remainder of about $2,167 (Item 8 at 3-4). Monthly debt payments were for two 
vehicles, two student loans, and a home loan.  Id.  His budget did not detail any 
payments for creditors listed in the SOR.    
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s controlling 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”8 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
 
8  See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable 
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” 
ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “Substantial 
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit 
Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
 
5 
 
 
                                           
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to 
 
9  “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”

DOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response. His 2002 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy listed 
$125,135 in delinquent debts which were discharged. He admitted responsibility for 12 
unpaid delinquent debts which he acquired after his bankruptcy discharge (SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
to 1.k and 1.n). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k was in his bankruptcy filing, and the IRS released 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.p were paid. He said he was 
making payments on his state tax lien of $15,387; however, he did not provide any proof 
of payments or other indications of his progress resolving this debt. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
Considering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude that none of the 
mitigating conditions apply. Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG 
¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve 
his delinquent debts.11 Applicant presented little evidence of good-faith efforts taken to 
contact creditors, or to resolve his debts since he acquired them.  
 
10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 
at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG ¶ 20(a), all debts are considered 
as a whole. 
 
11  “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
 
7 
 
 
                                                                                                                                            
 
I specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG ¶ 
20(b): “The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances”, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  
 
Applicant’s evidence established factors that may be considered as 
circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his 
1988 divorce, his failed business, raising four children, and his wife’s and his medical 
condition and the financial expenses associated with it. Notwithstanding, he failed to 
present evidence to show how these past circumstances beyond his control impaired 
his present ability to pay his debts.  
 
Applicant’s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his 
financial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security 
clearance applications, Applicant has been consistently employed since at least 2000. 
He has continuously worked for his current employer since August 2006. He presented 
little evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment 
plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. He is responsible for 11 medical 
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j) and a state tax lien of amount $15,000 (SOR ¶ 1.m). It is 
unclear when his last payments were made on any of these 12 delinquent debts. 
Applicant’s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he 
has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control of 
his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are 
recent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Although there is evidence that he has 
participated in some financial counseling (consulting with a bankruptcy attorney and a 
tax consultant), there are no indications that Applicant’s financial problems are being 
resolved or are under control. New delinquent debt surfaced after his 2002 bankruptcy. 
There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge 
obtained from financial counseling. I gave him credit for acting in good faith in his 2002 
bankruptcy; however, there is insufficient evidence to show good faith12 in the resolution 
 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). 
12  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
 
8 
 
 
                                                                                                                                            
of his debts. AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j and 1.m 
because Applicant did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the 
dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue” with respect to these 
debts.  
 
Applicant did not provide proof of any recent efforts to resolve his debts with the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j and 1.m. Considering the record as a whole, I conclude 
these 11 debts, totaling about $25,000 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that 
Applicant is responsible for them. Applicant failed to provide copies of payment plans, 
even though he has available income, according to his 2006 budget, to take this 
reasonable and prudent action. He has elected not to pay or resolve his 11 delinquent 
debts. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. His financial problems are continuing and likely to 
recur. He should have been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his 
delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2008. He has not 
carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the 
record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole person concept. AG  ¶ 2(c).   
Applicant’s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence 
of any security violation. Aside from his delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal 
 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

issue), he is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, 
rehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall amount of her delinquent debt at about 
$25,000 is relatively low.  
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct is more substantial. He has 
a significant history of delinquent debt as shown by his 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, 
which listed over $125,000 in debt. He also had a federal tax lien of $91,134 as recently 
as 2002. Applicant was well aware of his financial responsibilities, and had sufficient 
resources to develop a payment plan and begin payment of the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
to 1.j and 1.m. He learned, or should have learned, of the security significance of these 
delinquent debts in 2006 when he submitted his security clearance applications, and as 
a result of his interview with a government investigator. His efforts to resolve his 
delinquent debts were insufficient when compared to available income that he could 
have used to address his delinquent debts. His actions were not adequate to fully 
resolve security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, 
and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he 
has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k to 1.l:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n to 1.s:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
