APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Judge’s favorable finding under Guideline E is not at issue on appeal.1
Applicant argues that he is only making $6,000 a month, rather than $12,000 a month as found by the Judge.2
On that issue, the transcript contains the following exchange.  Judge: “You make $12,000 a month?”  Applicant: “Yes.”
Judge: “And that is after taxes and other deductions?” Applicant: “Yes.”  Transcript at 88.  Applicant also argues that
the Judge erred in finding that he had the means to satisfy his debts.  As to that issue, the transcript contains the following
exchange.   Applicant: “. . . I can make $1,000 per month.”  Judge: “So now it’s sixteen months?”  Applicant: “$1,000
per month.”  Transcript at 37.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 5, 2008, after the hearing,
Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.
Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse clearance
decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1
Applicant contends that the Judge’s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge
did not give sufficient weight to Applicant’s mitigating evidence, which indicated that Applicant’s
inability to satisfy his outstanding debts was due to a period of underemployment and the collapse
of the housing market.  He also contends that the Judge’s findings of fact give a distorted picture of
his financial situation.  Finally, Applicant notes that he has never compromised classified
information.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.
(1) The Board’s review of a Judge’s findings is limited to determining if they are supported
by substantial evidence—such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.
“This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two
inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding from
being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,
(1966).
After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge’s findings are based on
substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn
from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the
case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge’s material findings of security concern
are sustainable.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).2
Applicant’s house was foreclosed on in August 2007, and he owed the mortgage company over $11,000.  He3
had not made any payments on that debt and stated that he intended to file for bankruptcy to discharge it after he had paid
other delinquent debts.  Decision at 3.

(2) The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct
under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-
22325 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to
consideration of work performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-
08623 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant
actually mishandles or fails safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to
such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of
security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case
No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).
(3) The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a
favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a
whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant’s disagreement with
the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the
evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in
a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3
(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).
In this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial
obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant
outstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light of the foregoing,3
the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by
Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible
application of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to several of the
SOR allegations.   However, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient
to overcome all of the government’s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.
The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge’s decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,
2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data
and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, “including a ‘rational connection between
the facts found and the choice made.’” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Therefore, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision
under Guideline F are sustainable.
