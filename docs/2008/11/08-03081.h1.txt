Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant mitigated the security concern that arose by his filing for Chapter 7
bankruptcy protection in March 2008. 
On May 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on June 20, 2008,
admitted the sole SOR allegation and requested a hearing.2
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS
 App. Ex. II indicates Department Counsel forwarded three pages of documents to me. He
3
subsequently send me a fourth page (AE 8) with a small handwritten note requesting it be included with
Applicant’s post-hearing submissions and that he also did not object to that document.

The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on
August 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2008. The hearing was
conducted as scheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and admitted into the record without
objection. Applicant testified and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. The record
was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in
support of his case. Four documents were timely received, marked as AE 6-9 and admitted
into the record without objection. Department Counsel’s forwarding memorandum was
marked as App. Ex. II and is included in the file.  The transcript was received on October3
8, 2008.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admission to the sole SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is 32 years old and has been employed as a database administrator by
a defense contractor since April 2007. He graduated from high school in May 1994, and
served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force as an F-15 crew chief from June 1994 to June
1998. He was awarded an honorable discharge. Applicant worked at a retail store in 1998-
99 while attending a technical college from which he received an associate’s degree.
Applicant continued his education while working in the private sector as a systems analyst
from May 1999 to October 2000, and as a technology developer from October 2000 to April
2007. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 2007.
Applicant was married in October 2000. That marriage ended by divorce in February
2002. No children were born of this marriage. Applicant has been remarried since February
2002. He has a three-year-old daughter, a nine-year-old adopted son, and a 13-year-old
stepdaughter from this marriage. Individuals who have known Applicant and his family for
many years attest to him being a dependable and trustworthy person. (AE 8 and AE 9)
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2008. He listed 48
creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims totaling $213,474 in the petition. However,
the petition discloses 14 of the listed creditors were not owed anything, the single largest
creditor listed was the mortgage company that foreclosed on his former residence which,
although the amount of the claim listed is $138,369, is actually owed nothing, and three
student loans, totaling $32,320, on which collection has been deferred. Additionally, some
accounts are listed on more than one occasion in the petition. Applicant explained that his
attorney went through his credit report and listed everything contained in the report. (Tr.
p 54) Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in July 2008. (AE 6)

Applicant’s financial problems began in or about the latter part of 2005. He
purchased a residence in 2003 with an adjustable rate mortgage. His original mortgage
payment of $930 had increased to approximately $1,400 by 2006, and his real estate taxes
increased by about 60%. Unable to maintain the payments on the residence and service
his other debts, including several credit cards, he immediately sought ways to resolve his
financial dilemma.
Applicant’s residence was foreclosed on in 2007, after he was unsuccessful in
efforts to sell the house or work out a payment arrangement with the mortgage company.
He moved his family into a home owned by his father-in-law on which he is currently paying
rent of $1,000. The present rent includes charges for renovations made on the residence
and will be reduced to $800 at the end of 2008. 
Applicant stopped using most of his credit cards in 2006, and has not acquired any
new credit card charge since August 2007. He allowed a vehicle he had been making
payments on to be repossessed and began driving an older truck that was paid off and a
van his father-in-law allowed him to use. He completed a course on personal financial
management in May 2008. (AE 2) Having obtained the Chapter 7 discharge, Applicant is
now debt free except for the student loans. He and his wife have developed a reasonable
budget that allows them to live on his income and includes substantial payments on the
student loans and a modest contribution to savings. (AE 7)          
POLICIES
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial
considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this
case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of4 5
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of

proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the7
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to8
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable9
clearance decision.10
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard11
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access12
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      13
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant found himself in financial straits beginning in 2005 that eventually caused
him to seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2008. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)
19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting
financial obligations apply.
Applicant’s financial problems were caused in large part by the dramatic increases
in his mortgage payments and real estate taxes that occurred in or about 2005. However,
having obtained an adjustable rate mortgage, those are events that Applicant should have
anticipated. Thus, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the
financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances does not apply.
5
Applicant took immediate steps to regain control of his finances when he realized
the extent of his financial distress. He stopped using credit cards, secured a residence he
could afford, and began to live within his financial means. He successfully completed a
financial counselling program, has worked out a reasonable and manageable budget, and
he obtained a Chapter 7 discharge that leaves him debt free except for his student loans.
MC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and
MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts apply.  
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, including Applicant’s appearance and demeanor while testifying,
the letters of reference he submitted, the aggressive action he took to bring his finances
under control, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and the
applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the
financial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and
satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is granted.
