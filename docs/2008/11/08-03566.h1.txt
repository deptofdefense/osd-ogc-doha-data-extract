Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order
and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 20, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to
an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in
this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of
financial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against
Applicant. 
In addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(December 29, 2005). 
 See Applicant’s Exhibit A and his hearing testimony for a description of the debts and their status (Tr. 43–65).3

Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.
The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective
September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2
to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR
has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision2
or amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the
effective date.  
Applicant’s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 8, 2008, and he
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. The hearing
took place as scheduled on September 25, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on
October 2, 2008.
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts ranging from $131 to
$82,735 for a total of about $119,000. The largest of the debts is a student loan. He
denied 18 of the 19 debts, except for the student loan debt. Based on the record
evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 43-year-old commercial designer. He has worked for his current
employer since June 2005. His gross annual salary is about $46,000. He married in
1989 and divorced in 2004. He has two children, both of whom live with their mother. He
pays child support and he says he is current with this obligation. He earned an
associate’s degree in 1992 and is now working on a bachelor’s degree in marketing, the
cost of which is paid by his employer. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which at the hearing he did not
dispute. His history of financial problems is established by a 2007 credit report and a
2008 credit report (Exhibits 3 and 4). The largest debt is a student loan, which was
placed with a collection agency, and as of April 11, 2008, the balance was $82,735
(Exhibit 2 at 6). He attributes his financial problems to a bad marriage wherein his
spouse ran up credit card bills and hid matters from him. 
The status of the 19 debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the following
table.3

In July 2008, Applicant retained a firm to work toward removing and correcting
the negative or adverse information from his credit reports (Exhibit A). Their efforts to
date are reflected in the table above. In addition, he planned to take a course called
“Transforming Your Finances” in October 2008 (Exhibit A). 
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an5
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any6
existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any
level and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order7
10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting8
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An9
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate10
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme11
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12

conditions).

 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 17
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 18

The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination14
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically15
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be16
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it
indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting17
financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more18
than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the evidence is
sufficient to establish financial irresponsibility.
6
The guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security
concerns:
MC 1–the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
MC 2–the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
MC 3–the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
MC 4–the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
MC 5–the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
MC 6–the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
 
All the mitigating conditions have been considered, and except for MC 5, none apply in
Applicant’s favor. 
MC 5 applies because he provided documentary evidence that he successfully
disputed and deleted three accounts from his credit report. Otherwise, Applicant did not
present sufficient evidence to justify applying any MC. In reaching this conclusion, I
specifically considered the circumstance that his financial problems are likely due, in
part, to his marriage that ended in divorce in 2004. But Applicant did not present
sufficient evidence to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Indeed,
his dilatory actions in addressing his financial problems tend to undercut his reliance on
his troubled marriage.  
In addition, in reaching this conclusion, I specially considered the circumstance
that Applicant contacted several of the creditors and made periodic payments to several
as well, but this is little progress in light of the size of his indebtedness. His track record
of repayment is skimpy, and coupled with his limited financial means, is not sufficient to
establish a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve debts. 
 Revised Guidelines at 1–2 (listing nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept). 19
 Revised Guidelines at 2 (“the likelihood of continuation or recurrence”). 20
7
To conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,
or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the
whole-person concept  (to include his constructive community involvement) was given19
due consideration and that analysis does not supports a favorable decision. Indeed,
looking forward to the next 12 to 18 months, it is unlikely that he will successfully
resolve his financial problems.  This case is decided against Applicant. 20
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.g: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.h–1.i: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.j–1.l: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.m: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.n–1.s: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest  to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
