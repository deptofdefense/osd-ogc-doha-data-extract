James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On June 19, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to SOR paragraphs 1(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (i) Those favorable

findings are not at issue on appeal.

Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On September 22, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark W.
Harvey denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.   Applicant appealed pursuant to the1
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.
Rather, it contains new evidence which indicates that the IRS’s Taxpayer Advocate Service is
attempting to resolved Applicant’s outstanding tax debt.  The Board cannot consider this new
evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.
The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party
has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases de novo. Nor does it have
authority to grant an interim clearance so that Applicant can resolve her financial problems. See. e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008).  Applicant has not made an allegation
of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is
AFFIRMED.
