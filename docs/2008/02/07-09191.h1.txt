Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order
and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on September 20, 2007. The SOR is
equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.
The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a
history of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   
In addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)
approved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then
modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or
replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all
  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(December 29, 2005). 
2
adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September
1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised2
Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  
Applicant replied to the SOR on October 31, 2007, and requested a hearing. The
hearing took place as scheduled on January 30, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was
received on February 7, 2008.
The record was left open until February 15, 2008, to allow Applicant an
opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely
submitted and forwarded by department counsel who made no objections. The five-
page post-hearing exhibit is marked and admitted as Exhibit E. For the reasons
discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.   
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts ranging from $45 to
$7,175 for about $18,585. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual
allegations except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c, which he denied. Also, he
provided a short explanation about the origin of his financial problems and his remedial
actions. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 49-year-old systems analyst for a company engaged in defense
contracting. He has worked for his current employer since October 2005. He worked in
the same position for a different company from April 2004 to October 2005. In addition,
his employment history includes approximately 20 years of active duty military service in
the U.S. Navy until his retirement in 2004. When he retired, he was serving as chief
petty officer (paygrade E-7). He held a security clearance, without problems, for many
years in the Navy. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute (Exhibits
2 and 3). For example, an April 2006 credit report reveals a judgment for $1,934, 30
trade accounts of which 14 contain adverse information (past due, bad debt, etc.), and 7
collection accounts (Exhibit 3).
He attributes the origin of his financial problems to the 1999–2001 period when
he was on active duty in the Navy (Response to SOR). In August 1999, he received
transfer orders to a large naval base and then deployed overseas shortly thereafter.
These circumstances resulted in Applicant being unable to move his family to his new
duty location for about 18 months due to his deployment schedule. During this time he
3
incurred additional expenses and lost control of his finances. In time, his financial
problems grew worse due to the effect of snowballing. 
Applicant addressed the 11 debts alleged in the SOR during his hearing
testimony. The status of the accounts is summarized in the following table.
Debt Description Current Status
SOR ¶ 1.a–collection account for $7,175. In repayment program; current balance of
$4,013 (Exhibits A and E). 
SOR ¶ 1.b–charged-off account for
$2,880.
In repayment program (Exhibit A). 
SOR ¶ 1.c–collection account for $1,223. Reduced to judgment for $1,934 in 2004;
paid off in 2006 (Exhibits 1 and E at 1; Tr.
75–78).
SOR ¶ 1.d–collection account for $2,928. In repayment program (Exhibit A).
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and
1.k–collection accounts for $109, $199,
$136, $89, $93, and $45 for total of $671.
Will pay via a $2,500 loan against his
401(k) account; loan paperwork was
being processed when the record closed
(Exhibits D and E). 
SOR ¶ 1.j–collection account for $3,708. In repayment plan (Exhibit A). 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the indebtedness in SOR ¶ 1.a
because a collection lawsuit for this debt was dismissed in June 2006 (Exhibit C).
Further research, however, revealed that the debt is still outstanding with a balance of
$4,013, and it was added to the repayment program (Exhibit E at 1, 4, and 5). 
In December 2007, Applicant engaged a company to serve as a debt-
management agent for three creditors (Exhibit A). With the addition of the debt in SOR ¶
1.a, it now covers four creditors for about $13,350. He paid the set-up fees and paid the
initial monthly payment of $201 (Exhibits A and B). It is estimated to be a 24-month
plan.
In addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant is in a repayment agreement with
the IRS for tax year 2005 (Tr. 55). He owed the IRS about $900 due to under
withholding of taxes from his military retirement pay. He is paying $40 monthly to
resolve this obligation. Applicant is also indebted to the Defense Department for minor
damages to military housing when he retired in 2004 (Tr. 56). He now owes about $300
and is paying $40 monthly to resolve it. He is also making $227 monthly payments on a
car loan, and he has three credit card accounts, all of which are current. 
Applicant’s current financial condition is fairly described as living month-to-month.
Including his retirement pay, his net monthly income is about $4,280 with monthly

that there is no ‘right’ to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases
such as Duane’s.”).

expenses of approximately $3,437, which results in a remainder of $843 (Tr. 65–70).
Despite this positive cash flow, Applicant believes the remainder is spent on
unaccounted and unexpected expenses such as car repairs, medical bills, etc. (Tr.
69–70). 
Applicant has been married to the same woman since 1984. The couple have
two adult children. His wife has not worked on a regular basis since 1997 (Tr. 78–79).
Also, she has had medical problems resulting in out-of-pocket expenses. His 20-year-
old son is a full-time college student and lives with Applicant. His 25-year-old
stepdaughter and her child live across the street from Applicant. As a result, Applicant
and his wife provide some financial support to each child. Both Applicant’s wife and son
are attending college on scholarships thereby reducing educational expenses. 
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an4
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any5
existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any
level.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether6
an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting7
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An8
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate9
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme10
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11
The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination13
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically14
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be15
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it
 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 16
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 17
 Revised Guidelines at p. 14. 18
 MC 4 is “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”19
6
indicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations16 17
within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to
establish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.
Guideline F contains six conditions that could mitigate the security concerns.18
The most pertinent is the fourth MC, as it requires a person to initiate a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  He has made decent efforts to19
resolve the delinquent debts as established by the table above. The six collection
accounts for a total of about $671 will be repaid in the near future via the 401(k) loan,
which was being processed when the record closed. The four major debts for a total of
about $13,350 are being addressed through the repayment plan. And the judgment for
$1,934 was paid off in 2006. With the retirement pay and current salary, he has
sufficient income to pay for his family’s living expenses and other recurring obligations.
His efforts are sufficient to constitute a good-faith effort within the meaning of the
guideline.
This case has also been considered under the whole-person concept. Applicant
is 49 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances. He
has demonstrated his maturity and good judgment by taking positive, concrete actions
to address his history of the financial problems. To that end, Applicant has (1) a realistic
and workable plan to resolve his financial problems, (2) documented actions taken in
furtherance of the plan, and (3) shown a measurable improvement to the situation. It
appears Applicant is working seriously to resolve his indebtedness. In addition,
Applicant has 20 years of honorable military service and retired as a Navy chief petty
officer. This circumstance strongly suggests that Applicant has the requisite self-control,
good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to properly handle and safeguard
classified information.  
To conclude, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, both favorable
and unfavorable, and I have no doubts or concerns about Applicant’s suitability for a
security clearance. Although he should have acted sooner to address his financial
problems and did not present a perfect case in mitigation, he presented sufficient
evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.
Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance
decision.
