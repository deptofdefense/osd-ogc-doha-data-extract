HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines E (Personal 
Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 
86).1 On July 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1Government Exhibit (GE) 1. There is an allegation of falsification of the 2005 SF 86.   
 
2Ex I (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Mar. 31, 2005). Exhibit I is the source for the facts in 
the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise.

 revoked. 
                                                          
1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under 
Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case 
decided at a hearing. On November 7, 2007, Judge Christopher Graham held a hearing. 
Judge Graham left federal service prior to issuing his decision. On January 24, 2008, 
the case was assigned to me. Department Counsel requested a hearing and the second 
hearing was held on January 29, 2008. The transcript was completed on February 6, 
2008.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
Applicant objected to holding the second hearing and asked that the decision be 
based solely on the previous hearing. Department Counsel cited the importance of 
assessing credibility and requested a hearing (R2. 77). I granted Department Counsel’s 
motion for a hearing. 
 
Applicant objected to the hearing because he did not want to miss training. In an 
e-mail,4 I offered to contact the person conducting Applicant’s training. I wanted to 
explain why the hearing was necessary and to seek his excusal from training. Applicant 
telephoned me and requested that the hearing proceed on January 29, 2008. The 
hearing was set for 7:30 a.m. on January 29, 2008, to accommodate Applicant’s desire 
to avoid missing training (R2. 22).5 When the hearing began, Applicant cited his desire 
to attend training that day, and objected to the hearing being held that day (R2. 8-14). At 
the start of the hearing, he also indicated he did not believe he was prepared for the 
hearing (R2. 10). I offered to delay the hearing, however, Applicant said he wanted to 
hold the hearing that day (R2. 8-15). Department Counsel explained that Applicant had 
not received the 15-day notice to which he was entitled, and I offered to suspend the 
hearing at any time, if Applicant needed time to review documents or the transcript (R2. 
13-14). During his opening statement, Applicant expressed his appreciation for the early 
3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant’s case. 
 
4 I sustained Applicant’s objection to admission of e-mails discussing setting the hearing date (R. 
9). However, I explained to Applicant that those e-mails are available should the Appeal Board wish to 
have them attached to the record (R. 9).   
 
5 The citations to the record for the first hearing do not contain any subscript numbers.  The 
citations to the second hearing have a subscript “2,” for example: R2. 5 refers to page 5 of the second 
hearing.

start on the proceeding, and never expressed a clear objection to going forward with the 
hearing without delaying it (R2. 22).  Towards the end of the second hearing Applicant 
and I engaged in the following colloquy: 
 
Applicant: Yes. And I wasn’t trying to get out of the hearing at all, but the 
training session was very important to me and I didn’t want to keep 
dragging it out. You know, so I decided well you know what, if I can just go 
today and just get it over with I don’t want to keep having to delay you. 
 
AJ: I was a little surprised when you said, “No, let’s have it tomorrow.” 
 
Applicant:  Well, you know, I don’t like to go a whole lot of back and forth a 
lot of times. I like to get things done.  .  .  . And that’s what I’m about, just 
getting things done. And I did, it did. I might have taken a little time 
thinking about what I want to do, but I did want to have the opportunity to 
come out here and meet you and you to see me, face to face and get to 
see who I am as a person, as an individual.  .  .  . 
 
(R2. 74-75). 
 
The hearing on January 29, 2008, did not reveal any new, material facts. 
Essentially, the second hearing was consistent with the first hearing. At the second 
hearing, in a few instances, he remembered some facts which bolstered his credibility, 
or he clearly denied culpability for some offenses. To ensure Applicant was not 
prejudiced by holding the hearing on January 29, 2008, I will not consider the hearing 
on January 29, 2008, except where he provided facts that tended to support approval of 
his security clearance. No adverse facts will be considered against Applicant based on 
the hearing on January 29, 2008.   
 
In regard to Department Counsel’s submitted exhibits, Applicant objected to 
consideration of charges and events from 1990 and 1994 because they are not relevant 
being remote in time from the hearing (R. 26). Although these offenses have limited 
relevance as individual offenses, they cannot be considered piecemeal or in isolation. 
They must be considered under the whole person concept and especially in the context 
of whether Applicant truthfully disclosed adverse information on his SF 86. Applicant’s 
objection is overruled.  See also Judge Graham’s ruling at R. 27-28.    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant made a few admissions in his 
responses to interrogatories and at his hearings. His admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of 
record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 34-year-old senior communications systems engineer (R. 31, 35). 
He is single, and has a seven year old son (R. 32).  His son lives in a different state with 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
his mother (R. 32).  Applicant and the mother of his son have joint custody, however, his 
son’s mother is the primary custodian (R. 32-33). In 1997, he received a bachelor of arts 
degree in communications (R. 35, 56). He does not have any military service (R. 35).    
 
 On December 26, 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal 
Mischief, 4th Degree (R. 55). There was an altercation between several men (R. 36-38). 
Some white men were yelling racial slurs at Applicant and his friends (R. 38, 57, 59). 
Applicant avoided being seriously injured when someone swung a pipe at him and 
missed (R. 37, 58). Applicant threw a log through the window of the residence where 
the white men lived (R. 37, 38, 58, 61). Applicant said he took responsibility for his 
actions, but could not remember whether he pleaded guilty (R. 68-70). He paid 
restitution for the damaged window, paid a fine and completed some community service 
(R. 37-38, 65, 70).  SOR ¶ 1.a.  See also R2. 27-31. 
 
On July 10, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Disorderly 
Conduct/Intoxicated and Disruptive Behavior and (2) Simple Assault on a Police 
Officer/Government Official (R. 70-71).  He could not remember whether he went to the 
police station and could not remember whether he was intoxicated (R. 75). Count (1) 
was dismissed and he was found Not Guilty of Count (2) because the officer did not 
show up for court (R. 39, 71, 76).  Applicant said he could not remember anything about 
the events leading to the arrest (R. 73). At his second hearing, he disclosed the arrest 
was made to make an example of him and was without good cause.  He did not assault 
a government official (R2. 31). He did remember his hearing in court and the dismissal 
of the charge (R. 76-77, 79). SOR ¶ 1.b.  See also R2. 31-37. 
 
On March 10, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) manufacturing 
marijuana; (2) marijuana possession with intent to sell or distribute; and (3) maintaining 
a vehicle or dwelling place containing a controlled substance (R. 79-80; GE 6 at 2). 
Applicant was waiting for a package from his parents (R. 82). A package arrived, but it 
may have been for Applicant’s roommate (R. 83). It was definitely not Applicant’s 
package (R. 83). There was marijuana in the package, and Applicant was unpleasantly 
surprised (R. 85). The apartment was in Applicant’s name, and the police arrested 
Applicant (R. 84-85). He said he was a victim of circumstances and was worried 
“because at that time, and even the government stated that they were falsifying 
fictitiously after certain individuals. You know, young black males, at the time, and 
basically it was a situation where I was, had bad associations” (R. 90-91). The police 
report indicated 1000 grams of marijuana was seized from a U.S. mail package after a 
K-9 alert (GE 11). Applicant denied that it was his marijuana (R2. 43). He pleaded guilty 
and was found guilty of counts (2) and (3), both felonies (R. 39-40, 88-90; GE 6 at 2). 
The court sentenced him to four years in jail (three years suspended), to pay a fine and 
court costs totaling about $450, to complete 50 hours of community service, to be 
evaluated for substance abuse, and to serve five years of probation (R. 40, 95). He said 
he did not serve any time in jail (R. 41, 91-92). He successfully completed probation and 
his community service requirement (R. 40, 96). His drug tests did not have any adverse 
results (R. 94-95). SOR ¶ 1.c.  See also R2. 37-44.

On June 5, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) criminal 
possession of a weapon or firearm; (2) not using a seatbelt; (3) no automobile 
insurance; (4) failure to affix registration; and (5) driving without lights (R. 110-112). He 
was alone, as he drove his sister’s vehicle (R. 119). Applicant had just dropped off 
some friends (R2. 48-49). The police stopped the car Applicant was driving and found a 
firearm in the car (R. 111). He believed the firearm was found under the backseat (R2. 
48). It was not his firearm (R. 119). He was not aware the firearm was in the car when 
he was pulled over by the police (R2. 45-46). He did not remember the other details of 
the incident (R. 112-118). He was held in a cell overnight (R. 123). He pleaded guilty 
and the court found him guilty of count (1), and sentenced him to three weeks of house 
arrest (via ankle bracelet), to pay a $90 fine, and to complete 10 days of community 
service (R. 41, 125).  SOR ¶ 1.d. See also R2. 44-49. 
 
On January 26, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of 
marijuana of an amount greater than one half ounce and less than one and one half 
ounces (R. 127).  The charge was dismissed.  Applicant said the police found the 
marijuana at issue on the side of the road in front of his residence (R. 42, 128-133). At 
the second hearing, he indicated he was sure the marijuana was not found on his 
person, but was unsure about precisely where the marijuana was found (R2. 51-52). 
SOR ¶ 1.e. See also R2. 49-53. 
 
On August 25, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) operating a 
motor vehicle while intoxicated and (2) leaving the scene of an accident (R. 42). He hit a 
parked car, and his own car was totaled (R. 134). He could not remember leaving the 
scene of the accident (R. 135). The arrest report indicates he was stopped by the 
police, who noted serious damage to his vehicle (GE 8). The police officer noted the 
smell of alcohol on his breath, and administered a field sobriety test, which he failed.  
He was then arrested. Applicant said he remained at the scene of the accident (R2. 57), 
and he attributed his failure to pass the field sobriety test to the effects of an allergy 
medicine he was taking (R2. 54-55). He agreed the police attempted to give him a 
breathalyzer test, but did not explain why they were unable to complete the test (R2. 58). 
The court found him guilty of count (1) and sentenced him to pay a $300 fine with a $50 
surcharge (R. 138-139).  His driver’s license was suspended for 90 days.  SOR ¶ 1.f. 
See also R2. 53-59. 
 
In August and September 2004, a court issued two restraining orders against 
Applicant at the request of Applicant’s former girlfriend (R. 140). The orders were 
dismissed within 30 days of issuance. SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. 
 
Failure to Disclose Information for SF 86 and to Department of Defense 
Investigator  
    
 Applicant’s SF 86, executed on March 31, 2005, asked three questions that are 
relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                          
Section 24: Your Police Record – Alcohol/Drug Offenses Have you 
ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or 
drugs?  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record 
in your case has been ‘sealed’ or otherwise stricken from the court record. 
The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under 
the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an 
expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 
3607.   
 
Section 35: Your Financial Record - Repossessions In the last 7 years, 
have you had any property repossessed for any reason?  
 
Section 40: Public Record Civil Court Actions In the last 7 years, have 
you been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed 
elsewhere on this form?  
 
Applicant’s response to Section 24 of his SF 86 was “YES.” He listed his DUI 
arrest in August 2002, and he explained he was on medication when he was arrested.  
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges he did not disclose his 1999 marijuana possession charge. In 
response to interrogatories he said, “I did not know dismissals counted. [I d]id not 
remember. I was under the understanding that it was a booking (detainment) not an 
arrest. I was never given my rights.” (GE 3 at 2).  
 
At his hearing, he said he was not sure of the difference between being charged 
and a conviction (R. 43-44, 143-144).  He did not understand that he had to disclose 
information that did not result in a conviction (R. 143). He also said he disclosed the 
March 10, 1994, marijuana possession offense and indicated he received a fine and 
probation in response to Section 21 of his SF 86 (R. 143).  At his second hearing, he 
indicated he did not know why he did not disclose the 1999 marijuana possession 
charge (R2. 62). 
 
Applicant’s response to Section 35 of his SF 86 was “NO.” SOR ¶ 2.b alleged 
that his automobile was voluntarily repossessed in 2002 because he did not make his 
car payments. Applicant said his car was damaged in an accident, and he believed his 
insurance company totaled the car (R. 17-20, 46, 144-145). In his response to 
interrogatories, Applicant said he could not remember whether the car was repossessed 
(R. 145). His DoD interview states he told the investigator his car was repossessed in 
the summer of 2002 because Applicant was unable to make the payments (R. 145).6 
Applicant explained the DoD interview had some details that were incorrect (R. 147). 
Judge Graham asked Applicant to find out the status of the debt (R. 46-47, 55, 156).  
After the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from his insurance company, dated 
November 25, 2002, indicating his car was in an accident (Ex. B5). The accident 
resulted in a total loss. His insurance company made “Auto acceptance” payments of 
$500 on September 20, 2002, and $766 on November 19, 2002 (Ex. B5).  His insurance 
6 A credit report indicates Applicant owed $6,423 on the car (GE 9 and 10).

company arranged for their salvage yard to pick up Applicant’s vehicle (Ex. B5). See 
also R2. 62-64. 
 
Applicant’s response to Section 40 of his SF 86 was “YES.” He disclosed his 
2003 family court litigation over custody of his son.  However, he did not disclose the 
August and September 2004, restraining orders against Applicant (R. 145).7 SOR ¶ 2.c.  
He said he did not disclose them because they were dismissed and he viewed them as 
part of the custody litigation that he disclosed previously on his SF 86 (R. 149). His third 
reason for not listing the restraining orders was because they were “almost like criminal” 
because it could “turn criminal” and it’s a “grey area” (R. 149-150).  At his second 
hearing he emphasized that the restraining orders were part of the custody litigation, 
which lasted from 2003 to 2005, and he did disclose the custody litigation (R2. 64-66).  
 
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges that on September 12, 2005, Applicant did not disclose 
information in two areas to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Investigator: (1) 
His 1999 arrest and charge of marijuana possession of an amount greater than one half 
ounce and less than one and one half ounces; and (2) In August and September 2004, 
a court issued two restraining orders against Applicant. Applicant explained he did not 
realize he had to report a dismissed charge (R. 47).  He said the OPM Investigator did 
not ask about the restraining orders (R. 48). The OPM Investigator summarized the 
interview (GE 2), but did not make a statement at Applicant’s hearing. The interview 
summary does not establish Applicant was asked to provide the omitted information.  
See also R2. 67-70. 
 
 Applicant coached youth basketball in 1998 and 1999 (R. 150).  He assisted with 
basketball camps, and boys club (R. 150). He is active in his church (R. 150).  He visits 
his son and pays his child support (R. 153-154). He takes responsibility for his mistakes, 
and has earned the trust of his employer and the Department of Defense (R. 152).  A 
project manager described his work as excellent and lauded his professionalism (Ex. 
B1). Two high-level company officials commended Applicant’s tireless efforts to 
accomplish his mission as well as his excellent or terrific results (Ex. B2 and B3).  A 
fourth company official commended Applicant’s diligence, persistence and outstanding 
problem solving abilities (Ex. B4). Applicant works hard, helps others, pays his taxes, 
and is a good citizen (R. 152-153).  He is a responsible employee and considers himself 
to be “All-American” (R. 156-157).  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
7 In the restraining orders Applicant’s spouse accused Applicant of multiple criminal offenses.  
There was no evidence to substantiate her allegations of criminal conduct. 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                          
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by “substantial evidence,”8 
demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. 
Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, 
the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
8 See Directive ¶ E3.1.14. “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” ISCR 
Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). “This is something less 
than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the 
evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. 
Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but 
less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994). 
 
9 “The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”

Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: 
  
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, “Criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its 
very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, 
rules and regulations.” 
 
AG ¶ 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying, ¶ 31(a), “a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,” and ¶ 31(c), 
“allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.”  
 
Applicant admitted in 1990 he threw a log through a window. The criminal 
conduct in SOR ¶ 1.a is established.  
 
Applicant denied the 1993 offense of disorder or intoxicated conduct and assault 
on a police officer or government official.  The evidence did not establish the 1993 
offense. The arrest did not result in a conviction. SOR ¶ 1.b is not established. 
 
Applicant admitted and the records reflect he was charged with marijuana 
possession with intent to sell or distribute, and maintaining a vehicle or dwelling place 
containing a controlled substance in 1994. Both offenses are felonies. The marijuana 
possession involved approximately 1000 grams of marijuana. He pleaded guilty and 
was found guilty of both counts. Although he denied culpability for these two offenses, 
and collateral estoppel applies. SOR ¶ 1.c is established with respect to these two 
offenses.  
 
In ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006), the Appeal Board 
established a three-part test for determining when a guilty plea should not trigger 
collateral estoppel: 
 
First, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have 
been afforded a “full and fair opportunity” to litigate that issue in the earlier 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
case. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. at 313; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 
95 (1980). Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must 
be the same as those resolved against the opposing party in the first trial. 
Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155 (1979). Collateral estoppel 
extends only to questions “distinctly put in issue and directly determined” 
in the criminal prosecution. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 334 (1915). 
Third, the application of collateral estoppel in the second hearing must not 
result in unfairness. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 330 
(1979)(detailing circumstances where allowing the use of collateral 
estoppel would result in unfairness); Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 
at 155 (court should consider whether other special circumstances warrant 
an exception to the normal rules of preclusion). Federal courts decline to 
apply collateral estoppel where the circumstances indicate a lack of 
incentive to litigate the original matter. “Preclusion is sometimes unfair if 
the party to be bound lacked an incentive to litigate the first trial, especially 
in comparison to the stakes of the second trial.” Otherson v. U.S. Dept. of 
Justice, 711 F.2d at 273. The arguments for not giving preclusive effect to 
misdemeanor convictions are that an individual may not have the incentive 
to fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is so much less at 
stake, or that plea bargains create an actual disincentive to litigate these 
particular issues. See Otherson, 711 F.2d at 276. 
 
Applicant admitted in 1994 the police found a firearm in a vehicle he was driving. 
He denied knowledge of the firearm, but pleaded guilty to illegal firearm possession. 
Under New York Consolidated Law Service Penal § 265.01 this offense is a class A 
misdemeanor with a maximum sentence to one year in jail. The fine contains a one-
page arrest report, which lacks a description of the basis for the arrest (GE 7). Aside 
from Applicant’s consistent denial of culpability, there is no evidence of record for 
believing Applicant knowingly possessed the firearm. Because of the lenient sentence 
he received for pleading guilty and based primarily on unfairness, I conclude collateral 
estoppel does bar Applicant from challenging this misdemeanor conviction. I am not 
convinced he knew the firearm was in the vehicle he was driving. I find the 1994 offense 
of firearm possession was not established. I find For Applicant in regard to SOR ¶ 1.d.   
 
Applicant denied the 1999 marijuana possession offense. The evidence does not 
establish the 1999 marijuana possession. The arrest did not result in a conviction. 
Applicant refuted SOR ¶ 1.e and I find For Applicant.  
 
Applicant admitted in 2002 the police arrested him for DUI after he had an 
accident that totaled his vehicle. He subsequently was found guilty. He denied being 
intoxicated by alcohol, but contended his consumption of medicine impaired his driving.  
I elect not to apply collateral estoppel and to permit Applicant to challenge this 
conviction. I conclude after carefully reviewing the police report of the incident, that he 
left the scene of the accident, and was impaired by the alcohol consumption while 
driving. He failed a field sobriety test, and did not fully cooperate in the breath alcohol 
test (GE 8). I find the 2002 offense of DUI was established in regard to SOR ¶ 1.f.   
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                          
 
The two 2004 restraining orders allege criminal misconduct, which Applicant 
denied. There was no evidence aside from the allegations in the restraining order that 
Applicant committed the criminal conduct alleged in the restraining orders. Applicant’s 
statement is sufficient to refute the allegations of criminal conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 
1.h, and I find For Applicant. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. § 1001 by falsifying his 2005 
SF 86 and failing to disclose information to an OPM investigator. For a violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. The Supreme Court defined 
“materiality” in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement 
having a “natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision 
making body to which it is addressed.” See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 
547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    
 
  As indicated in the discussion below, I found that Applicant falsely failed to 
disclose information about his 1999 charge of marijuana possession in Section 24 of his 
2005 SF 86. I also concluded the other alleged falsifications were not established. If 
Applicant had provided an accurate answer on his 2005 SF 86 about the 1999 charge of 
marijuana possession, his accurate answer would not be capable of influencing the 
government to deny his security clearance. His 1999 marijuana possession charge is 
not sufficiently important derogatory information.  The 1999 marijuana possession 
charge occurred about five years before he signed his SF 86. The 1999 marijuana 
possession did not result in a conviction, and the underlying conduct was not 
established. It was not sufficiently serious10 to jeopardize approval of his security 
clearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 is a serious crime, a felony 
(the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 
fine). However, in this instance materiality and thus, making a false statement under 18 
U.S.C. § 1001, are not established.  
 
  In sum, AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(c) apply with respect to some or all of the offenses in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f.   
 
AG ¶ 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; 
 
(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those 
pressures are no longer present in the person's life; 
 
(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, 
10 In Applicant’s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the 
number of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited 
to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or 
restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. 
 
AG ¶¶ 32(a) – 31(b) do not fully apply. Applicant’s DUI occurred in 2002, which is 
somewhat recent. There are three criminal offenses at issue in 1990, 1994 and 2002.  
They are not isolated. They cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness 
and good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced into committing the criminal 
offenses.  
 
AG ¶ 32(c) applies to some offenses but not to others. As indicated previously 
the offenses in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f are established and substantiated. The 
offenses in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d through 1.i are refuted and not substantiated.   
 
AG ¶ 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, 
including the passage of about 5 years since his DUI in 2002. Criminal activity has not 
recurred. He expressed remorse concerning his youthful indiscretions, and he did 
accept responsibility for some of his misconduct. He has received some job training, 
and has an outstanding employment record. However, his post-offense behavior is 
insufficient to fully mitigate the very serious misconduct in this case as described in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted 
required information on his 2005 SF 86 and to an OPM investigator in 2006.  Applicant’s 
falsification of Section 24 of his SF 86 is substantiated; however, the other three 
allegations of falsification are not substantiated. 
 
For Section 24 of his SF 86, he responded, “YES” and listed his DUI arrest in 
August 2002. However, he did not disclose his 1999 marijuana possession charge. In 
response to interrogatories he said, “I did not know dismissals counted. [I d]id not 
remember. I was under the understanding that it was a booking (detainment) not an 
arrest. I was never given my rights.” (GE 3 at 2). At his hearing, he said he was not sure 
of the difference between being charged and a conviction (R. 43-44, 143-144). He did 
not understand that he had to disclose information that did not result in a conviction (R. 
143). He also said he disclosed the March 10, 1994, marijuana possession offense and 
indicated he received a fine and probation in response to Section 21 of his SF 86 (R. 
143). These explanations for not disclosing his 1999 marijuana possession charge are 
not credible. He has misdemeanor involvement with law enforcement and the courts in 
1990 and 1993, and a felony conviction in 1994, followed by misdemeanor convictions 
in 1994 and 2002. He impressed me as a very intelligent, knowledgeable Applicant. By 
2005, when he completed his SF 86, he was well aware of the significance of being 
charged, and deliberately chose not to disclose the requested information about his 
1999 marijuana possession charge. The falsification of an SF 86 need not be a material 
falsification to constitute a security concern. Here, the 1999 marijuana possession 
charge was not material, but it is of sufficient importance to be a security concern. 
 
For SOR ¶ 2.b, Applicant’s vehicle was totaled in an accident. His insurance 
company arranged for their salvage yard to pick up Applicant’s vehicle. His vehicle was 
not repossessed by the lien holder. A credit report’s statement about a vehicle being 
repossessed is outweighed by the letter from the insurance company about the salvage 
yard taking Applicant’s vehicle. He did not fail to disclose repossession of his vehicle on 
his SF 86.   
 
For SOR ¶ 2.c, Applicant disclosed his 2003 family court litigation over custody of 
his son. However, he did not disclose the August and September 2004, restraining 
orders against Applicant in response to Section 40 of his SF 86. He said he did not 
disclose them because they were dismissed and he viewed them as part of the custody 
litigation that he disclosed previously on his SF 86. Because of the apparent linkage to 
the custody issue, his disclosure was sufficient. 
 
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges that on September 12, 2005, Applicant did not disclose 
sufficient information to an OPM Investigator about his 1999 arrest and charge of 
marijuana possession of an amount greater than one half ounce and less than one and 
one half ounces; and the two restraining orders against Applicant in 2004. Applicant 
explained he did not realize he had to report a dismissed charge. He said the OPM 
Investigator did not ask about the restraining orders. The OPM Investigator summarized 
the interview, but the interview summary does not establish Applicant was asked to 
provide the omitted information.   
 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                          
I find For Applicant under Guideline E for SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d.  However, I 
specifically find that AG ¶ 16 (a) applies with respect to SOR ¶ 2.a.   
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this 
case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully. 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and, 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 17 apply to SOR ¶ 2.a. Applicant’s 
2005 falsification of his SF 86, is sufficiently recent to remain a security concern.11 He 
11The conduct in SOR ¶ 2.a cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is required to evaluate the 
record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant’s conduct. 
ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 
26, 2004)). When the 2005 falsification of his SF 86 is considered in connection with the criminal conduct in 
1990, 1994 and 2002, the personal conduct in SOR ¶ 2.a cannot be mitigated under AG ¶ 16(c). His 2005 
falsification of his SF 86 continues to cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. 
 
 
15 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
did not promptly inform the government of the falsification. He continued to deny 
culpability for omitting the 1999 marijuana possession charge at his hearing in 2007. He 
did not receive counseling designed to improve his conduct.  No one advised him to 
falsify his SF 86. He admitted that he omitted the 1999 marijuana possession charge, 
and the falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. His failure to admit responsibility for 
falsifying his 2005 SF 86 weighs against convincing me that similar misbehavior is 
unlikely to recur. The falsification of his SF 86 casts doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. His current service to the contractor and the 
Department of Defense is an important positive step, but it is not enough to mitigate his 
conduct. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     
Eventually Applicant admitted to security officials that he failed to disclose his 
1999 marijuana possession charge on of his 2005 SF 86. His 1990, 1994, and 2002 
misconduct occurred so long ago that his criminal conduct would be mitigated (in 
February 2008), but for the 2005 falsification of his SF 86. He provided some evidence 
of remorse, or regret concerning his misconduct when he repeatedly stated he wanted 
to put his misconduct behind him. He recognized the damage his misconduct caused. 
His record of good employment weighs in his favor. These factors show some 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
  The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct is more substantial. His  
falsification of his 2005 SF 86 and his 1990, 1994, and 2002 misconduct were 
knowledgeable and voluntary. His misconduct is not isolated. He did not accept full 
responsibility for failing to disclose the 1999 marijuana possession charge on his 2005 
SF 86, instead contending at his 2007 hearing that he did not understand what a charge 
was. He had ample experience in the criminal justice system, and is an intelligent man 
with a bachelor’s degree. He knew that he was charged in 1999 with marijuana 
possession, and he deliberately chose not to disclose the information on his 2005 SF 
86. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Criminal 
misbehavior is not prudent or responsible. His falsification of his 2005 SF 86 is 
particularly aggravating, and weighs heavily against granting or continuing his security

clearance. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear 
understanding about how to avoid future problematic situations. I have persistent and 
serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  
 
  His misconduct calls into question his current ability or willingness to comply with 
laws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, 
and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he 
has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct and personal 
conduct.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”12 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.

clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
