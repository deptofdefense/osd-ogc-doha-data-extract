LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial history. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is granted.  
 
On November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and 
effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 27, 2007, and requested a 
hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another 
Administrative Judge on January 9, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 4, 2008. 
DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled on February 20, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, 
 
2 
 
which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and 
submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, without objection. One witness testified on 
Applicant’s behalf. I granted Applicant’s request to keep the record open until March 3, 
2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted 90 pages of documents which 
were marked AE D though V, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s 
memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The record closed on March 3, 2008. DOHA 
received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2008.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, dated November 30, 2007, Applicant admitted all the 
factual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional 
information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the 
U.S. Marine Corps from 1967 to 1971, and was honorably discharged. He has an 
equivalency degree from high school obtained while he was in the Marine Corps. His 
marriage from 1970 to 1973 ended in divorce. He remarried in 1975. He and his wife 
have a 23-year-old daughter and he adopted his wife’s two children.1  
 
 Applicant’s wife was laid off from her employment in about 1998, and was 
unemployed or underemployed until 2000. Applicant had continuous employment with a 
company from 1988 through 2000. His employer sold his division to another company in 
2000. He continued to be employed by the successor company. Applicant traveled 
frequently for his company and received many hours of overtime pay. He and his wife 
came to rely on the overtime. After the events of September 11, 2001, his company 
changed their philosophy and essentially ended his travel and overtime. He was notified 
in 2002 that he was on the list of employees to be laid off and that he should start 
looking for other employment. Applicant started working on adding a garage to his 
house before his employment became a concern. He accumulated credit card and other 
debt for the costs of the addition. In preparation of their imminent financial issues 
related to his employment, Applicant went through a debt consolidation program as a 
means of lowering interest rates on their debts. The plan called for Applicant to pay 
$1,635 per month to the company which disbursed the funds to his creditors. The 
payments were lowered to $1,410 in January 2003. He made payments every month 
from March 2002 through May 2003.2 
 
 Applicant refinanced his mortgage in December 2002. Creditors were paid as 
part of the settlement. An auto financing company was paid $17,528; a financing 
company was paid $11,399 for his tractor; and two bank/financial institutions were paid 
$10,158 and $4,518.3

 Applicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) retirement account in 2002, which 
triggered serious tax consequences. Applicant was ignorant of the tax ramifications. He 
was told that there was a 10% penalty, but did not consider that the $48,880 would be 
taxed as income. Only $799 in federal income tax was withheld from the disbursement. 
Applicant paid a professional $1,000 to review his 2002 tax return and attempt to work 
out a payment plan with the state and the IRS, if necessary. The professional did not 
handle the return expeditiously. Despite numerous requests from Applicant, the return 
was not prepared to be filed until June 2004. He owed the IRS more than $21,000 for 
tax year 2002. Applicant withdrew an additional $14,924 from his retirement account in 
2004. $2,238 was withheld for federal income tax and $746 was withheld for state tax.4 
 
 Applicant made a payment plan with the IRS in August 2004, to pay $220 every 
month. The IRS also retained any refunds due Applicant for subsequent tax years. In 
February 2008, the IRS removed the penalties for failure to file and pay for tax year 
2002. The IRS credited Applicant with $5,272 for penalties and interest from his 2002 
return. They applied $3,708 toward his debt for tax year 2004, and stated he would 
receive at least $1,560 in a refund. With this action, all the back taxes owed to the IRS 
have been resolved. He made a payment plan with his state to pay $75 per month, 
which was increased to $100 per month in August 2007. The balance owed to the state 
as of February 8, 2008 was $2,235. Applicant intends to pay an additional $220 to the 
state with the money he was using to pay the IRS. With the additional payments, the 
state will be paid within about seven months.5 
 
 Applicant was laid off from his company in about November 2003. He was 
unemployed or underemployed, working sporadically, until he was hired by his current 
employer in August 2005.6 
 
 The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $63,227. Individual 
debts are discussed below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a debt of $18,588 to a financial institution for a credit card 
account. This debt was included in Applicant’s debt consolidation program in 2002 and 
2003. The financial institution forgave the debt and issued an IRS Form 1099-C 
cancelling the debt of $16,564 on December 31, 2006. This means that Applicant no 
longer owes and the creditor no longer expects payment on the debt. This can have tax 
consequences and a taxpayer could be required to pay income tax on the amount of the 
forgiven debt. An exception is when the taxpayer is insolvent. Applicant addressed this 
on his tax return for tax year 2006, certifying that he and his wife were insolvent.7  
                                                          
4 Tr. at 20-22, 42-46, 68-69; AE I, K, M. Applicant’s tax debts were not alleged in the SOR and 
are not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be used when viewing Applicant’s overall financial 
situation, when analyzing the “whole person,” and the potential application of mitigating conditions.

 An IRS Form 1099-C, cancelling the debt of $6,946 as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, was 
issued by the creditor on November 1, 2007. This debt was also included in Applicant’s 
debt consolidation program in 2002 and 2003.8 
 
 Applicant admitted to the debts of $12,813, $5,652, and $19,228, as alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. He entered into a payment plan in March 2005, with the 
creditor from SOR ¶ 1.d to pay $75 per month. Applicant made payments of $2,625 to 
that creditor. The balance on the debt as of February 25, 2008, was $4,969. Once the 
tax debt to his state is paid, he will then use that additional money to pay the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.d. Applicant has not made any payments on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e. 
His intent is to pay all his delinquent debts. His plan is pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, then 
move to the next debt.9 
 
 Applicant’s debt consolidation program in 2002 to 2003 did not include financial 
counseling and he has not received any counseling since then. He chose not to file for 
bankruptcy because he wanted to pay his debts. Applicant and his wife help their 
daughter in college, but otherwise they have severely cut back on their expenses and 
live frugally. He still has not finished building the garage because of the costs.10 
 
 Applicant’s manager wrote a letter on his behalf noting his professional job 
performance and integrity. Applicant discussed his financial situation with his manager 
and his manager recommends him for a security clearance.11 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative 
Judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must 
consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, in making a decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 
6 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his 
obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant had steady employment with the same company for 13 years and 
earned a good salary with plenty of travel and overtime. This continued after the 
company was bought in 2000. He planned on building a garage and accumulated credit 
card and other debt for the addition. Things started to change in about the fall of 2001. 
His company curtailed his travel and overtime, which substantially lowered his income. 
He was notified in 2002 that a lay off was coming and he was laid off in about 
November 2003. He was unemployed or underemployed until he was hired by his 
current employer in August 2005. 
 
 Applicant started preparing for the financial consequences of his diminished pay 
and loss of employment well in advance of the lay off. He went through a debt 
consolidation program and paid $1,635 into the program every month from March 2002 
through December 2002, and the lowered $1,410 payments from January 2003 until 
May 2003, when he could no longer maintain the payments. He refinanced his 
 
7 
 
mortgage in December 2002, and paid creditors more than $43,000 as part of the 
settlement.  
 
 Applicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) retirement account in 2002. Through 
ignorance or poor advice, he was unaware of the tax consequences. He owed the IRS 
more than $21,000 for tax year 2002. He made a payment plan with the IRS in August 
2004, to pay $220 every month. The debt to the IRS is now paid. He made a payment 
plan with his state to pay $75 per month, which was increased to $100 per month in 
August 2007. He intends to pay an additional $220 to the state with the money he was 
using to pay the IRS. The state will be paid within about seven months. 
 
 Two of the debts in the SOR were formally forgiven by the creditors. He has paid 
one creditor $75 per month since March 2005. His intent is to pay all his delinquent 
debts. Once the state is paid, he will then use that additional money to add to the $75 
he is paying the one creditor. He will then move to the next debt. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems are directly related to his unemployment and 
underemployment. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. He 
started addressing his financial issues even before he was laid off, when his overtime 
was cut off. He handled his debts as well as he could for as long as he could. Once he 
was working consistently again, he started paying his debts. He began regularly paying 
the IRS in 2004, and he also instituted payment plans with the state and the creditor 
from SOR ¶ 1.d. The debt to the IRS is paid, and the debt to the state will be paid within 
a reasonable period. He will then use the extra money on the remaining debts. I find 
that Applicant is acting responsibly under the circumstances and his actions constitute a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. AG ¶ 20(b) is applicable and AG ¶ 20(d) is 
partially applicable. He has not received counseling but there are clear indications that 
his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. AG ¶ 20(c) is partially 
applicable. No other mitigating condition is completely applicable. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
8 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served honorably in the 
Marine Corps from 1967 to 1971. He worked for the same company from 1988 through 
2000. He was earning a good salary, traveling and working many hours of overtime. His 
job continued after his company sold his division in 2000. The new company essentially 
eliminated his travel and overtime in 2001, and he was laid off in 2003. Applicant has 
not ignored his financial responsibilities; he has attempted to address them to the best 
of his ability. He refinanced his mortgage in December 2002. Creditors were paid more 
than $43,000 as part of the settlement. Applicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) in 
2002, and an additional $14,924 in 2004. He was unprepared for the serious tax 
consequences triggered by the withdrawals. It took him years, but he paid the IRS, and 
is on the verge of paying off the state. He has regularly paid one creditor since March 
2005. Applicant chose not to file bankruptcy. His intent is to pay all his delinquent debts. 
The money that was used to pay the IRS will go to pay the state, and then the next 
creditor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2005, and is highly 
regarded. He and his wife live very frugally. He sincerely, candidly, and credibly testified 
about his finances, and his desire to correct his problems.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1e:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
