HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 7, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (EPSQ 
86).1 On August 23, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1Item 5. There is no allegation of falsification of Applicant’s 2004 EPSQ 86.   
 
2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Aug. 23, 2006). Item I is the source for the facts in 
the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise.

1, 2008. 
                                                          
1992, as amended and modified.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline 
B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), dated August 27, 2007, was provided to him, and he was 
afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, 
or mitigation.5 Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM. The case was 
assigned to me on January 3
 
Procedural Ruling 
 
Department Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in the FORM 
concerning the Russian Federation (FORM at page 3-7) and supporting documents to 
show detail and context for the facts in the FORM (Ex. I to VIII—listed in FORM at 7). 
Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice.   
 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for 
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 
2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative 
notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from 
government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 
2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). In addition to the facts 
outlined in the FORM at 3-7, I have taken administrative notice of facts in Exhibits I to 
VIII. See the Russian Federation section of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra. 
 
 
3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum 
directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines are not applicable to Applicant’s case because his SOR was issued on 
Aug. 23, 2006. 
 
4Item 4 (Applicant’s response to SOR) is dated Sep. 21, 2006. He signed a receipt for the SOR 
on Sep. 2, 2006 (Item 3).  
 
5The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated Aug. 30, 2007; 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated October 5, 2007. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he 
had 30 days after Applicant’s receipt to submit information.

Findings of Fact6 
 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a and 1.d to 1.g in his response to the SOR. He also provided an explanation for all 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.g. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is 47 years old (Item 5). He was born in Greece, and received a degree 
from a Russian University in 1981 (Item 5 at 1, 3).  In 1984, he married his first wife in 
Moscow (Item 5 at 5).  They divorced in 1996. Id. In 1985, his first son was born in 
Moscow. Id. In 1996, he married his current wife, who is a U.S. citizen (Item 5 at 4). In 
1997 and 2003, his second and third sons were born in the United States (Item 5 at 6).  
His first son became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (Item 5 at 5).    
 
From 1981 to 1989, Applicant worked for a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
(USSR) Ministry in the USSR and overseas that had important and sensitive 
responsibilities for foreign affairs and national security (Item 5 at 6-7). However, he has 
not had any contact since 1989 with any employees from this Ministry (Item 6 at 2). He 
was a member of the USSR Communist Party from June 1989 until August 1989 (Item 5 
at 9).7 In August 1989, he terminated his Communist Party membership and requested 
political asylum in the United States (Item 5 at 7). In March 1996, he became a U.S. 
citizen (Item 5 at 7).   
 
Applicant’s contacts with Russian government officials after he emigrated from 
Russia in 1989 were “official,” as they were all related to his employment with U.S. 
corporations. From 1996 to 2001, Applicant held U.S. corporate employment that 
resulted in frequent contact with Russian officials (Item 6 at 2-3). From October 2002 to 
December 2003, Applicant lived in Russia on behalf of a U.S. corporation, and had 
regular contact with Russian government officials employed by an important Russian 
government agency. Id.; Item 5 at 7. From October 1998 to October 2002, Applicant 
traveled to Russia more than 20 times (Item 6 at 3-6). The U.S. Government reaped 
some benefit of his travel to Russia and employment with the U.S. corporations (Item 4 
at 2).  He currently has an official U.S. Government passport. Id.  The record does not 
include information about his travel to Russia after December 2003. 
     
Applicant’s parents are currently citizens and residents of Russia.8 He has 
monthly, telephonic contact with his parents. His father retired from an important city 
governmental position, and until about 10 years ago, his mother was employed by the 
Russian and/or USSR Government. His father receives a disability pension. His mother 
was a well-known public figure, and frequently presented a radio show at an 
6 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect 
Applicant and his family’s privacy.  The cited sources contain more specific information.  
 
7 Applicant was coerced into joining the Communist Party (Item 5 at 17, Item 6 at 7). 
 
8 Items 4 and 6 are the sources for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise.

independent radio station.  His mother visited Applicant in the United States three times, 
and his father visited Applicant in the United States twice. They stayed at Applicant’s 
residence. His parents do not plan to immigrate to the United States. Applicant does not 
provide financial support to them.  
 
Applicant had part ownership in an apartment located in Russia.9 His share was 
valued at $8,000 to $9,000. He was receiving $200 per month in rent, which he used to 
pay utilities. Most likely the apartment became the property of the Russian Government 
in February 2007 because of Applicant’s acceptance of U.S. political asylum.       
 
The Russian Federation10 
 
The Russian Federation is a vast and diverse country.  It is about twice the size 
of the United States, and has a population of 142 million people. It achieved 
independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991.     
 
The threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the areas in 
the vicinity of Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the 
terrorists. Acts of terrorism include taking hostages and bombings. Applicant’s parents 
do not live in Chechnya. 
 
Russia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, 
but in Chechnya the treatment of some prisoners and detainees violates human rights 
standards. Russia has a large prison population, and prison conditions are below 
international standards. The Russian Government has weakened freedom of the press 
by eliminating some television networks and by encouraging self-censorship.   
 
The Russian Federation’s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on 
collection of information from the United States.11 The old Soviet Union engaged in a 
series of high profile espionage missions against the United States.  The Russian 
Federation continued in this tradition. The 2004 Intelligence Threat Handbook (2004 
ITH) states, “The FBI estimates that more than 105,000 Russians immigrated to the 
United States in the late 1980s. The Russians, like many intelligence services have 
traditionally used émigrés to gather intelligence.” Id. at 16. However, the specific 
espionage examples cited in the 2004 ITH involved native-born U.S. citizens or Russian 
diplomats, and none involved Russian émigrés.

10Exhibit IV (“Russian Political, Economic, and Security Issues and U.S. Interests,” Congressional 
Research Service Report, May 31, 2007) and the FORM pages 3-7 are the source for the facts in this 
section, unless stated otherwise.   
 
11 Exhibit VI, (“Intelligence Threat Handbook,” Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies 
for the Interagency Operational Security Support Staff, June 2004) is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph.

The relationship between the United States and Russia remains complicated.  
The United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, 
including the reduction of strategic arsenals, prevention of the spread of weapons of 
mass destruction, and in combating terrorism. Since 1992, the United States has spent 
over $7 billion in Cooperative Threat Reduction funds and related programs to reduce 
the threat of Russian weapons of mass destruction. Billions of dollars have also been 
allocated to aid Russian democratization and market reform. Recently, however, the 
Russian-U.S. relationship shows more discord than in previous years because for 
example, Russia has opposed deployment of a U.S.-developed missile defense system 
in Poland. Nevertheless, there are important areas of continued cooperation. Russia 
and the United States seek to compel Iran to bring its nuclear programs into compliance 
with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) rules. Specifically, on March 24, 2007, 
Russia voted with the United States on a UN Security Council resolution that tightens 
economic and political sanctions on Iran because of Iran’s nuclear program.    
 
Policies 
 
 In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must 
consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In 
addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines 
are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are 
used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply 
these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process 
provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. 
 
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept,” an administrative judge should consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the 
final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the 
clearance is “clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.12 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
12 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-
11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “This is something less than the weight 
of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                          
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has 
produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 
provides, “The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to 
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by 
Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to 
obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” The burden of disproving a mitigating 
condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2005).13 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours 
as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose 
a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, 
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to 
protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of 
legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise 
of classified information. 
  
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.”  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. 
Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than 
allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to 
suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: 
 
 
 
 
 
prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal Maritime 
Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a 
preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
13‟The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the 
Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”  
ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                             
Foreign Influence 
 
Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.1 describes why a security concern may exist under 
Guideline B:  
 
when an individual’s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to 
duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. 
 
Two of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could 
raise a security concern in this case. FI DC 1 applies where an “immediate family 
member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.” Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.2.1. 
“Immediate family members” include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, and sisters.  Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.3.1. FI DC 6 applies where there is  
“[c]onduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure by a foreign government.” Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.2.6. 
 
I disagree with the contention in the FORM that FI DC 3, “Relatives, cohabitants, 
or associates who are connected with any foreign government,” and FIDC 8, “A 
substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business 
that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence” apply.14 The Russian 
Government does not currently employ his parents. The information about their receipt 
of Russian pensions is not sufficiently specific for application of FI DC 3. Applicant said 
he thought his property interest in a Russian apartment was terminated in 2007, ending 
the applicability of FI DC 8.  
 
I agree with the FORM that FI DCs 1 and 6 apply. Applicant’s father and mother 
are “immediate family members” and persons to whom he “has close ties of affection or 
obligation.” They are also citizens of and live in Russia. Even if only one relative lives in 
Russia, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and 
could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 
03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). The mere possession of close family ties with a 
person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. 
ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). However, such ties in this case do 
raise a security concern under FI DCs 1 and 6 because his parents were Russian 
government employees with significant stature. Moreover, Applicant himself had 
sensitive, national security-related employment with the USSR Government from 1981 
to 1989. After immigrating to the United States in 1989, Applicant obtained U.S. 
corporate employment which resulted in more than 20 trips to Russia, and from October 
                                                          
14 Directive ¶¶ E2.A2.1.2.3 and E2.A2.1.2.8.  
 
8 
                                                                                                                                                             
2002 to December 2003, he lived in Russia. His connections to Russia are sufficiently 
significant to make him vulnerable to Russian coercion, exploitation or pressure.   
 
Applicant is required to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation 
sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.   
 
Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that 
any of the five foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC) apply. FI MC 1 recognizes 
that security concerns are reduced when the “immediate family member(s), (spouse, 
father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) 
involved and the United States.” Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.3.1. Notwithstanding the facially 
disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that an Applicant must 
prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not agents of a foreign 
power, and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could 
force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.  ISCR 
Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004). 
 
The Appeal Board, however, does not apply the statutory definition of “agent of a 
foreign power.” Instead, the Appeal Board has held that “An employee of a foreign 
government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, 
military, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign power for purposes 
of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.” ISCR Case No. 02-24254 (App. Bd. Jun. 
29, 2004). In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has broadly defined “agent of a 
foreign power.”15   
 
The second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the 
“associate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and 
the United States.” The Appeal Board interprets this language as establishing a very 
high standard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is at most a slight 
possibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or 
acquaintance in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) 
(stating, “[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant

FI MC 1 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants 
with relatives or associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it 
excludes person from countries where there are foreign governments, foreign political 
organizations, or foreign non-governmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very 
specific type of threat–the risk of a foreign power exploiting an applicant’s foreign 
relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act adversely to the interests of the 
United States. The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI MC 1 where there is 
a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in question.  ISCR Case No. 03-22643 
(App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005). 
 
His father and mother are citizens and residents of Russia. The evidence does 
not establish that his family members living in Russia are Russian agents or that they 
are agents of any other foreign power.   
 
The nature of a nation’s government, its relationship with the United States, and 
its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s family 
members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or 
duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a 
family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is 
known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated 
relationship of Russia to the United States places a significant, but not insurmountable 
burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in 
Russia do not pose security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose 
between loyalty to the United States and his family members.16 With its occasionally 
adversarial stance and its mixed human rights record, it is conceivable that Russia 
would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the United States. 
 
There is no evidence that his elderly father and mother are or have been, political 
activists, challenging the policies of the Russian Government. Although Applicant and 
his parents were employees of the USSR and/or Russian governments, they do not 
currently work for the Russian Government or military or any news media.  There is no 
evidence that terrorists have approached or threatened Applicant or his parents for any 
reason. There is no evidence the Russian Government has approached Appellant 
(unrelated to his U.S. corporate employment). There is no evidence that his parents 
living in Russia currently engage in activities which would bring attention to themselves 
or that they are even aware of Applicant’s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility 
that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Russian Government, 
16 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than 
an applicant with relatives living in Russia. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) 
(stating an applicant has “a very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns” when 
parents and siblings live in Iran).  See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(articulating “very heavy burden” standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran). See also 
ISCR Case No. 06-17164 at 15 (A.J. Oct. 23, 2007) (listing 23 consecutive cases involving U.S. citizens 
with Iranian connections whose clearances were denied).

which may seek to quiet those which speak out against it.  Applicant deserves some 
credit because of the reduced possibility that Russia will exploit his family; however, FI 
MC 1 cannot be applied in this case.  Even if there was substantial evidence of the 
“family members’ low-key noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the [Russian 
Government] has not contacted them about Applicant in the past, such factors are 
insufficient to support the application of FI MC 1” because of the nature of the Russian 
Government and its complicated, and sometimes contentious relationship to the United 
States.    
 
FI MC 2 can mitigate security concerns where “[c]ontacts with foreign citizens are 
the result of official United States Government business.” Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.3.2.  
Applicant said that the U.S. Government benefited from his visits to Russia.  However, 
his employment was with U.S. corporations, not with the U.S. Government.  He did not 
provide sufficient details or any corroboration to establish his manifestly very significant 
contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government officials from 1996 to 
December 2003 resulted from official U.S. Government business. 
 
FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where “contact and correspondence with 
foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.” Directive ¶ E2.A2.1.3.3. Applicant has 
monthly contacts by telephone with his parents living in Russia, and they visit him 
and/or stayed with him five times (twice for father, thrice for mother) when they visit the 
United States.  He probably visited them when he visited Russia more twenty times over 
during the last ten years. FI MC 3 does not apply because his contacts with them are 
not casual and infrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006) (finding contacts with applicant’s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per 
year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 
2006) (finding contacts with applicant’s siblings once every four or five months not 
casual and infrequent).17      
 
                                                          
17In regard to FI MC 3, the Appeal Board had determined that contacts with relatives living in a 
foreign country must be both casual and infrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006). Moreover, contacts with such family members are presumed to be “not casual.” Id. In the analysis 
of countervailing evidence, it is legal error to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: 
applicant’s ties to the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of 
prominence of relatives living in a foreign country (Id.); “family members’ low-key and noncontroversial 
lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian government has not contacted them about Applicant” (ISCR Case 
No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to 
negate FI MC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative’s fragile 
health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-
00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), financial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial dependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives spend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of any connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government 
in question (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at 
exploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country’s 
friendly relationship with the U.S., its stable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military 
agreements with the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)); and an 
applicant’s “refusal to travel to Iran” and “meticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules 
relating to his work” (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)).

Whole Person Concept 
 
 In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount 
concern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the “whole person” concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by 
the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other 
variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all 
relevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful 
analysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive ¶ E2.2.1:  
 
(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The 
voluntariness of participation; (6) The presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation 
for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E2.2.3, “The ultimate determination of whether the granting or 
continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful 
consideration” of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
A Guideline B decision concerning Russia must take into consideration the 
geopolitical situation in Russia, as well as the dangers existing in Russia.18 Russia is a 
diplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both 
countries have mutual interests. Russia is a key partner in the search for peace in the 
Middle East and resolution of problems with Iraq and Iran. Russia was an important ally 
in World War II, and then our greatest antagonist during the Cold War.  Russia has a 
mixed human rights record and like the United States has been subject to terrorist 
attacks. Russia is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic 
information.  
   
Applicant did not mitigate the government’s security concerns over possible 
foreign influence raised by his visits to Russia because he traveled to Russia more than 
20 times between 1998 and October 2002. He lived in Russia from October 2002 to 
December 2003. The file does not indicate whether or not he traveled to Russia after 
December 2003. He travelled to Russia with the permission of his U.S. corporate 
employers, and his contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees 
benefited the U.S. Government.  He did not, however, provide witness statements about 
his contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees, who could 
corroborate his contentions about the U.S. Government benefits resulting from his 
contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees.  
                                                          
18 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient 
discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                             
                                                          
Applicant's ties to his parents living in Russia with whom he has monthly 
telephone conversations as well as his frequent visits to Russia establish his close ties 
of affection to them. There is a possibility Applicant could be placed in a position of 
having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or 
government and the interests of the United States.  
 
Applicant has lived in the United States since 1989 (except for the 15 months he 
lived in Russia in 2002-2003). He became a U.S. citizen in 1996. His wife and three 
sons are U.S. citizens. However, he did not fully develop the evidence showing his 
connections to the United States. He did not provide corroborating statements 
concerning his loyalty and trustworthiness.  He did not provide any recommendations of 
employers, neighbors, friends, or family members supporting his application for a 
security clearance. After weighing the evidence of his connections to Russia, and to the 
United States, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of mitigating the foreign 
influence security concern.  
 
           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”19 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the 
reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b to 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d to 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
