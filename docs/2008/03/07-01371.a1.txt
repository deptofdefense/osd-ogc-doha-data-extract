APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Lenore M. Imhof, Esq.
The Judge’s favorable decision under Guideline J is not at issue in this appeal.  1
The SOR states that Applicant executed the SCA on January 23, 2006.  The first page of the SCA (Government2
Exhibit [GE] 1) states that it was certified on February 2, 2006, the date upon which the Judge found Applicant
completed the SCA.  The January date alleged in the SOR does not appear in GE 1.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 25, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis
for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E
(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)
(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 3, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative
Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a
timely appeal pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in concluding that
Applicant had knowingly falsified his security clearance application (SCA); and  whether the Judge
erred in not favorably applying Guideline E mitigating conditions.   Finding no error, we affirm.1
The Judge made the following pertinent findings: Applicant was arrested in May 2001, as
he was finishing college, for possession and distribution of 100 ecstasy pills.  Pleading guilty,
Applicant was sentenced to five years probation, a suspended driver’s license, a fine of $3,205.00,
and 200 hours of community service.  He completed his sentence in 2003 and was released from
probation two years early.
In 2003 Applicant was arrested for receiving stolen property, having been stopped by the
police for riding in a stolen car driven by a friend.  The charge was subsequently dismissed as
Applicant had not known that the car was stolen.  On February 2, 2006,  when completing his SCA,2
Applicant answered “yes” to a question concerning his having been arrested, charged, or convicted
within the seven years prior.  He listed the 2001 arrest and conviction but did not mention the 2003
arrest.  The Judge noted that, on the SCA, Applicant stated that “there is no record of trouble” since
the 2001 incident.  Decision at 4.
The Judge concluded that, in not mentioning the 2003 arrest, Applicant had knowingly
omitted information that he was legally required to disclose.  He stated, in the Conclusions section
of his decision, the Applicant “provided inconsistent explanations for his omission of the 2003 arrest
. . .  At his hearing he claimed he was so focused on the details of the 2001 arrest he forgot about the
2003 arrest.  Yet, in providing details about the 2001 arrest . . . he affirmatively stated he had not
been involved since 2001 in any other adverse criminal conduct.”  Decision at 6.  
The Judge noted that Applicant did not disclose the second incident until confronted with it
during the investigative interview, which precluded a conclusion that he had made a prompt, good-
faith effort to correct the omission.  The Board also notes record evidence that Applicant was an
honors graduate of a well-known university, thereby evidencing a level of  sophistication consistent
3
with the Judge’s view that Applicant intended the plain meaning of his words.  The Board also notes
that Applicant’s appeal brief attributes his omission to the haste in which he filled out the SCA,
which appears inconsistent with his testimony that he was simply too focused on the first event to
recall the second.  
Viewed in the light of the record as a whole, the Judge has articulated “a satisfactory
explanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found” and his
adverse decision, both as to the intentional nature of Applicant’s omission as well as the application
of Guideline E mitigating conditions.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).
The record supports the Judge’s conclusion that Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion that
it is “clearly consistent with the interests of the national security” for him to have a clearance.  See
Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that
the Judge’s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  
Order
The Judge’s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.
