APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On July 13, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
2
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On November 27, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan
denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse clearance
decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.
Applicant argues that the Judge’s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did
not give sufficient weight to Applicant’s mitigating evidence which showed that his indebtedness
had resulted from circumstances beyond his control, that he had acted responsibly under the
circumstances and made a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors, and that there are now
clear indications that his financial problems are under control.  As part of his argument, Applicant
notes that the Judge’s findings could have given a fuller explanation of Applicant’s financial
circumstances.  Applicant also provides new evidence which indicates that since the hearing the
twelve delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,729 have now been reduced to four
delinquent accounts  totaling approximately $7,300 of consumer debt and $15,343 of mortgage
related debt.   Applicant’s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. 
The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Therefore,
the Board may not consider Applicant’s efforts to reduce his outstanding indebtedness after the close
of the record.  That evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR
Case No. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007). 
The Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless she
specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  She
is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961
at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  After reviewing the Judge’s findings, the Board concludes that they
are supported by “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support
such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.”  Directive ¶  E3.1.32.1.  See
also Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).
 
The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a
favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a
whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant’s disagreement with
the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the
evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in
a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3
(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).
In this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting
financial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still owed approximately $56,729 on
3
twelve delinquent accounts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that
Applicant’s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App.
Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the
length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of
relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to some of the SOR allegations.
However, she reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in
mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government’s security concerns.  The Board does not
review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to
demonstrate the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that
the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,
“including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” Motor Vehicle
Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting
Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). Therefore, the Judge’s
ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.
