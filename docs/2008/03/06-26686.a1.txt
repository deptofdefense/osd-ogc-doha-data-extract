APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On July 27, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),
2
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided
on the written record.  On December 13, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge
Joseph Testan denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to
the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
In her brief, Applicant requests that the Appeal Board grant her an interim secret clearance
for 24 months so that she can resolve her financial problems.  Her appeal brief contains no assertion
of harmful error on the part of the Judge.   
The Board does not have authority to grant clearance on a conditional or probationary basis.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4
(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005).  The Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the
appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  Applicant has not made an
allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security
clearance is AFFIRMED.
