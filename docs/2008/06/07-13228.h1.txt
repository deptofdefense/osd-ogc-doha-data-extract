Decision
______________
MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on March 2, 2007. On January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the
security concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its
action to deny her a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge.
The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 6, 2008. She answered
the SOR in writing on February 26, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing.
On March 26, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)
consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to
In a letter to DOHA of November 27, 2007 (Item 5), Applicant commented she was “anxious to receive [her]1
final clearance.” She may well have been granted an interim clearance, but it is not documented in the record.
Available documentation (Item 5) shows Applicant signed a debt consolidation agreement with a law firm on2
November 13, 2007. Applicant has indicated that the majority of her debt is is included in the plan and I accept
her representations on this issue. 
2
Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was
received by the May 4, 2008, due date. On May 27, 2008, the case was assigned to me
to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue
a security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the government’s FORM,
including Applicant’s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 3), eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
Findings of Fact
DOHA alleges under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes
delinquent debt totaling $16,256 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.u), and that as of November
2007 she had a negative cash flow of $231.80 each month (SOR ¶ 1.v). Under
Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified her
March 2007 e-QIP by denying that she was over 180 days delinquent on any debts
within the last seven years and that she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any
debts (SOR ¶ 2.a). In her Answer (Item 3), Applicant admitted liability for several
delinquent debts due to a divorce (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.t,
1.u), but asserted the $1,288 auto loan debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) had been paid. She admitted
she also had a negative monthly balance after payment of expenses and some debts
(SOR ¶ 1.v). Applicant denied the other alleged delinquencies (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, 1.n
through 1.s). She also denied that she deliberately falsified her e-QIP (SOR ¶ 2.a), and
averred she had been unaware of any debts before a “visit” from an investigator. After
consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old office manager who has worked for her employer since
February 2007 (Item 4). The available record does not show that she has ever held a
security clearance.1
Applicant had two prior marriages that ended in divorce before she married her
current spouse in December 2003. While she was married to her second husband from
April 1999 to October 2003 (Item 4), she began to fall behind on several financial
obligations (Item 5), as set forth in the following table (Items 5, 6, 7).

In June 2003, Applicant went to work as an executive assistant for her current
spouse. They married in late December 2003. From May 2005 to February 2007, she
was employed as an office assistant for another company (Item 4). In February 2007,
Applicant financed the purchase of a 2007 model-year car through a loan of $26,816 to
be repaid at $529 per month for 73 months (SOR ¶ 1.j) (Items 5, 7). As of February
2007, a son from her first marriage was living outside the home but three other children
bearing the surname of her second husband were living with her and her third spouse
(Item 4). 
Applicant went to work as an administrative professional for her current
employer, a defense contractor (Item 4, Item 5), in February 2007. On March 2, 2007,
Applicant completed an e-QIP. She responded “Yes” to question 27b concerning any
repossessions in the last seven years, and disclosed the voluntary surrender of a
vehicle in February 2001 on which she reported owing about $4,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g) due to
financial problems associated with a divorce. Applicant responded “No” to question 28a.
“In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” and
question 28b. “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”
A check of Applicant’s credit on March 16, 2007, revealed an outstanding
charged off balance of $4,012 for the repossessed auto she had listed on her e-QIP
(SOR ¶ 1.g). Applicant also reportedly owed other delinquent balances, including
$2,673 to an apartment lessor (SOR ¶ 1.a), revolving credit card debt of $1,131 (SOR
¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, 1.i), wireless phone debt of $877 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.m), medical debt in
collection totaling $1,807 (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.s), and an  installment loan debt in collection
since December 2001 with an updated balance of $1,587 (SOR ¶ 1.u) (Item 7).
In August 2007, Applicant and her third husband separated. She has since
maintained a separate residence from him, at a monthly rental cost of $1,150 (Item 5).
In September 2007, Applicant took out an educational loan of $11,736 to be
repaid at $113 per month for 180 months (SOR ¶ 1.k).  In November 2007, DOHA3
asked Applicant to document the status of her delinquent debts, to furnish a current
credit report, and to complete a personal financial statement. At the time, she was
reportedly one month past due in her car loan (SOR ¶ 1.j) (Item 5).
6
On November 13, 2007, Applicant entered into an agreement with a law firm for
debt negotiation and debt settlement services. Under the debt settlement agreement,
her total debt of $54,670 (including some current accounts) was to be settled for
payments totaling $24,602. With fees of $11,350, she was to pay the estimated
settlement amount of $35,952 at $571 per month starting November 16, 2007 (Item 5).
Applicant responded to DOHA’s interrogatories on November 27, 2007. She
indicated that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e-1.i, 1.m-1.q, and 1.t-1.u would be resolved
under the debt consolidation plan, and that she would pay some of the smaller debts
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.n, 1.o) by December 16, 2007. She also provided documentation
showing that she paid $800 on her vehicle loan (SOR ¶ 1.j) in late November 2007.
Despite an annual salary of $50,000 and monthly child support income of $441,
Applicant reported a monthly net deficit of $231.80 after payment of expenses and three
debts ($529 for her car, $372 for a line of credit opened in May 2007, and $352 for an
unsecured loan opened in July 2007). Applicant did not indicate whether she had any
bank savings (Item 5).
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available,
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in
making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The
7
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security
decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set
out in AG & 18:
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Applicant has a history of financial delinquency since about 2001, when creditors
began placing delinquent balances for collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u). Several more
financial obligations became seriously past due in 2002, including a $2,673 debt to an
apartment lessor (SOR ¶ 1.a), over $1,000 in medical debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s),
and a $36 debt for a returned check (SOR ¶ 1.b). She lost her car through a voluntary
repossession for failure to make her payments during her second marriage (SOR ¶ 1.g).
Yet many of her debts were incurred more recently. A revolving charge opened in
November 2004 was charged off in December 2005 due to her failure to pay a relatively
small $239 balance (SOR ¶ 1.e). A cellular telephone debt of $460 was charged off and
placed for collection in 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Her gasoline credit card opened in April 2005
had become $413 past due by November of that year (SOR ¶ 1.i). She fell behind on
consumer credit card accounts opened in the past two years (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.h).  As
of November 2007, she was late 30 days in her car payment (SOR ¶  1.j). As of
December 2007, she owed a past due balance of $341 on a student loan taken out in
September 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Significant security concerns are raised by “inability or
8
unwillingness to satisfy debts” (AG ¶ 19(a)) and by “a history of not meeting financial
obligations” (AG ¶ 19(c)).
Applicant’s financial problems are too pervasive and too recent to satisfy
mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a) (“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,
or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment”). As of February
2008, she admitted she owed delinquent debt totaling about $7,618 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
1.e-1.f, 1.h-1.i, 1.l-1.m, 1.t-1.u). Assuming the $800 she paid on her auto loan in
November 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.j) went to the past due balance on her auto loan, there is
credible evidence of $6,550 in additional delinquent debt that she now denies. Her credit
card account with a balance of $554 was closed by the credit grantor when it became
$40 past due (SOR ¶ 1.d). Moreover, the student loan account opened in September
2007 was reported on her January 2008 credit report as past due in the amount of $341
with last activity in October 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.k). She presented no evidence of any recent
payments on the student loan. As for the remaining disputed debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.n-
1.q), Applicant indicated in November 2007 that they were either included in her debt
consolidation, or she was going to pay them by mid-December 2007. She offered no
explanation for denying debts that she had previously acknowledged and that are listed
as delinquent on one or more of her credit reports. AG ¶ 20(e) (“the individual has a
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue”) does not apply in the absence of
documented proof substantiating her basis for disputing them. 
Applicant’s effort to bring her automobile loan current warrant a favorable finding
as to SOR ¶ 1.j, but it is not enough to apply either AG ¶ 20(c) (“the person has
received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications
that the problem is being resolved or is under control”) or AG ¶ 20(d) (“the individual
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts”).  She
has arranged to settle most of her debt under a debt repayment plan, but this is but a
preliminary first step to resolve her debt and not a substitute for a track record of regular
payments. Given her negative cash flow situation (she reported a monthly deficit of
$231.80 as of November 2007), it is not at all clear that she will be able to make the
$571 monthly payments required under the debt consolidation contract.
Applicant attributes her financial problems to her divorce (“I will say that the debt
listed is a direct result of a drastic financial change in circumstances brought about by
divorce.” Item 3). Yet Applicant has failed to adequately document or explain the extent
to which factors beyond her control caused the majority of her indebtedness. AG ¶ 20(b)
(“the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly
under the circumstances”) applies only in very limited part in that the financial burden of
maintaining a separate residence since August 2007 was a likely factor in her falling
behind in her car loan, student loan, and recently opened credit card accounts during
9
the last quarter of 2007. It does not extenuate or mitigate the years of financial poor
judgment evident in her repeatedly taking on new debt while old debt went unpaid.
Applicant has not demonstrated that she can handle her finances responsibly.
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15:
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.
When Applicant applied for a security clearance in early March 2007, she owed
on several accounts that were seriously past due and had been charged off or placed
for collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e-1.i, 1.l-1.u). These debts should have been reported
in response to the financial delinquency inquiries pertinent to debts over 180 days within
the past seven years (question 28a) and to debts currently over 90 days delinquent
(question 28b). Applicant instead responded “No” to both questions. 
Under AG ¶ 16(a) personal conduct concerns are raised by the “deliberate
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary
responsibilities.” Applicant does not contest that she answered “No” to the debt
inquiries, but submits she did not intentionally falsify her e-QIP. In answer to DOHA’s
concerns that she falsified material facts, Applicant stated, “When I completed the E-
Quip, I was unaware of the items listed in this Statement of Reasons. It was only after a
visit from an investigator that I became aware of these items.” (Item 3).
The burden is on the government of proving knowing falsification in light of
Applicant’s denial. The government presented as Item 7 Applicant’s credit report from
March 16, 2007, showing charged off or collection balances on several individual
accounts which support a reasonable inference of intentional falsification. On or more
likely before March 16, 2007, Applicant had disputed with the credit bureaus her
responsibility for some medical debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.s) and a wireless services debt
(SOR ¶ 1.m). This shows Applicant knew before any visit from a government
investigator that some accounts were being reported on her credit record as collection
accounts. Even if she had a good-faith basis to believe she did not owe those debs, she
has not disputed then or now her responsibility for her delinquent gas credit card in
SOR ¶ 1.i, the cellular phone debt in SOR ¶ 1.f, the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, or the
apartment debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. All are individual accounts that had been in collection for
several months (in the case of the apartment debt since July 2004) by the time she
10
completed her e-QIP. There is no evidence that someone else used or handled
payment of her accounts in a manner that would have kept her from knowing about
them. Security concerns are raised under AG ¶ 16(a) in the absence of persuasive
evidence showing she was ignorant of her debt when she completed her e-QIP. Her
listing of the car repossession in response to question 27b did not relieve her of her
responsibility to report other delinquencies under question 28a and/or 28b. Concerns as
to whether Applicant has been fully candid about the reasons for the omission of
delinquent debt from her e-QIP preclude me from considering AG ¶ 17(a) (“the
individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or
falsification before being confronted with the facts”), even though Applicant is credited
with acknowledging several of the debts when she responded to DOHA interrogatories
in November 2007.
Whole Person Concept
Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. 
I considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and
circumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those
persons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all
times. Applicant remains under a significant debt burden that is not likely to be resolved
in the near future. She indicated in November 2007 that she was operating at a net
deficit each month and she reported no savings to draw on. In the absence of a
demonstrated ability to handle her finances responsibly, and due to persistent personal
conduct concerns, I am unable to conclude that she possesses the requisite good
judgment that must be demanded of those in a position of trust.
