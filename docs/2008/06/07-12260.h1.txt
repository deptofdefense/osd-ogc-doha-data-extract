Decision

GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 28, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
EPSQ version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On November 
29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 21, 2007. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated January 3, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on January 23, 2008, and the case was 
assigned to Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro on January 25, 2008. It was 
reassigned to me on February 14, 2008, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on February 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, 
on March 19, 2008. 
 
During the hearing, five Government exhibits were received without objection. 
Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was 
received on March 28, 2008.  The record remained open until April 8, 2008, to enable 
Applicant to furnish documents to support his contentions, and eight documents were 
timely submitted and received without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the factual allegations in 
¶¶ 1.j., 1.i., and 1.n. of the SOR.  He denied all other allegations.  
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  He was 
previously granted a SECRET clearance in July 2002.1  He was married to his first wife 
from 1987 until 2002, and married his current spouse in 2004. His wife has two children, 
and he has one daughter, not with his first wife, born in November 1992. 
 
From May 1999 until the present, Applicant has been gainfully employed by 
defense contractors as either an electrician or industrial electrician.2 Applicant’s 
finances were apparently unremarkable until about 1991. From the Government’s 
viewpoint, thereafter, he apparently periodically experienced financial difficulties which 
resulted in accounts becoming delinquent and being “charged off” and/or placed for 
collection. Federal tax liens were placed against his property on several occasions, and 
his wages were garnished because of child support arrearage.

Security Officer, dated Oct. 6, 2005).

The SOR identified fourteen purportedly continuing delinquencies, but Applicant 
contends several of the allegations are duplicates of others; several have been satisfied 
or otherwise resolved; and some were not his responsibility. His contentions have merit.  
The evidence and information offered by the Government consists of two credit reports 
and written and oral statements made by Applicant.  The same statements, along with 
official court records, were offered in support of Applicant’s case. The fourteen debts 
listed in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, according to the Credit 
Reports, dated November 20, 2007 (the most current one in evidence), and November 
15, 2006, as well as Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:

SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.j. refer to both the original creditor and the subsequently 
assigned collection agent, as conceded by Department Counsel.3 A cursory review of 
the November 2006 Credit Report leaves no doubt as to that conclusion,4 and including 
both credit report entries as separate allegations in the SOR provides some notice of 
where the account was transferred, but also tends to inflate the perception of financial 
irresponsibility. The account(s) pertain to a used automobile for which Applicant could 
not maintain payments,5 so he voluntarily relinquished the vehicle to the creditor.6  
While he did not make payments for a substantial period, he eventually entered into a 
payment plan with the collection agent and, as of February 2008, agreed to make 
monthly payments of $150.00, with the first payment in March 2008.7 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.f. refer to medical charges from largely unidentified 
(referred to in the November 2006 Credit Report as “unknown”) creditors.8 Applicant 
denied they were incurred by him or any member of his immediate family, and surmised 
they might have been incurred by his ex-wife on behalf of their daughter.9  In that event, 
they are not his responsibility but that of his ex-wife who was the custodial parent.10 
One of the potential creditors, a medical provider not fully identified in SOR ¶ 1.f., was 
approached by Applicant, and Applicant was informed that the balance of $109.00 was 
not his account but that of his daughter.11 The account referred to in SOR ¶ 1.d. is 
alleged to have been placed for collection in October 2006, and it appears in the 
November 2007 Credit Report,12 but not in the November 2006 Credit Report.  There 
are no statements of account or other evidence supporting the allegations. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g. through 1.i. refer to delinquent balances owed, as of November 
2006, on federal tax liens filed against Applicant by the IRS, without further information 
pertaining to dates or reasons.  The information upon which the SOR allegations was 
based was derived from the November 2006 Credit Report.13  The credit report does 
not identify the dates the liens were placed, or the current status of each such lien.  The

November 2007 Credit Report does not mention any IRS liens. Applicant denied being 
indebted to the IRS and contended he has always paid his federal income tax.14  In his 
Answer to the SOR, he indicated that he was told by the IRS that no such liens 
existed.15 
 
Pertaining to SOR ¶ 1.g., a notice of federal tax lien was issued in August 1991, 
based on an unpaid balance of assessment totaling $1,135.96.16 However, that lien was 
released by the IRS in August 1992,17 well before the credit reports were created or the 
SOR was written.  Pertaining to SOR ¶ 1.h., a notice of federal tax lien was issued in 
February 1992, based on an unpaid balance of assessment totaling $1,049.63.18 
However, that lien was released by the IRS in April 1992,19 also well before the credit 
reports were created or the SOR was written.  Pertaining to SOR ¶ 1.i., a notice of 
federal tax lien was issued in February 1991, based on an unpaid balance of 
assessment totaling $1,532.69.20 However, that lien was released by the IRS in May 
1991,21 also well before the credit reports were created or the SOR was written.  In fact, 
none of those federal tax liens should have still remained in the November 2006 Credit 
Report as they antedate the credit report by more than seven years.22  A thorough 
investigation and review of the public records, as well as more accurate and reliable 
credit information gathering and reporting would have established those facts. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k. refers to a credit card account, opened in September 2000, which 
purportedly had a credit limit of $500.00, resulting in a “charge-off” of $1,178.00.  The 
November 2006 Credit Report lists the account twice.  One reference is to the credit 
limit of $500.00, the high credit of $511.00, and a zero balance. That account was 
supposedly “transferred or sold”, with the balance charged-off in July 2001.23 
Substantially the same information appears in the November 2007 Credit Report.24 The 
second reference is to an account opened in September 2000, with a credit limit of 
14 Tr. at 24-25, 38-41.

$511.00, and a zero balance.25  The November 2006 Credit Report reflects $1,178.00 
being charged-off in March 2002.26  There is no mention of the larger amount in the 
more recent credit report. 
 
Applicant disputed the existence of any outstanding balance and contends he put 
money in his sister’s account every month and, pursuant to an agreement with a 
collection attorney, she made the payments by check, in the amount of $207.00, until 
the account was paid off during 2000-01.27  He attempted to locate the checks but was 
unable to do so, and sought to confirm the current zero status of the account with the 
original creditor, but the creditor could find no information regarding the account.28 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l. refers to a credit card affiliated with a checking account, opened in the 
late 1990s, which was placed for collection in September 2003. The November 2006 
Credit Report refers to the account,29 but the November 2007 Credit Report does not 
mention it.  Applicant disputed the existence of an outstanding balance and contends 
there had been a dispute over the balance several years ago, but the dispute was 
supposedly resolved (when the creditor’s computer system was down) and he was 
notified of a zero balance.30 He thought nothing further about the account until he was 
informed by DOHA that it was still a current issue.  He followed up on the matter and 
spoke with the original creditor who informed him that there was no record that his initial 
dispute was made within the allowed timeframe, so at the time he was informed of the 
zero balance the account had already been forwarded for collection.31 He attempted to 
settle the account with the original creditor but was told nothing could be done with it 
and that he would have to deal with the unspecified and unidentified collection agent.32 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m. refers to an automobile insurance account purportedly placed for 
collection in April 2002.  The November 2006 Credit Report refers to the account, and 
indicates the $368.00 balance was placed for collection in April 2002,33 but the 
November 2007 Credit Report does not mention it.  Applicant accepted the possibility of 
having such an account with that company,34 but disputed the existence of an

outstanding balance.  He contends that his efforts to determine the validity of the 
delinquency resulted in the creditor advising him they could find no account in his name 
and no balance owed.35 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n. refers to the wage garnishment for child support and child support 
arrearage.  As written, the allegation infers an involuntary garnishment of wages in the 
biweekly amounts of $334.00 (for child support) and $50.00 (for child support 
arrearage). In fact, the garnishment was the result of a “Voluntary Income Deduction 
Agreement” as reported to DISCO in October 2005.36  Prior to that action, Applicant had 
been making “informal” monthly child support payments to the child’s mother in the 
amount of $300.00, plus extras as needed.37  He contends the arrangement worked 
satisfactorily until the child’s mother found out about his pending relationship with his 
new wife-to-be.38  At that point she went to court.  As a result, Applicant was determined 
to be in arrears in the amount of $2,640.00 and the support payments were 
formalized.39 His child support arrearage has been paid in full, and his child support 
account is current.40 
 
Applicant borrowed money from his 401(k) to pay off the majority of his bills, and 
is now current in all other obligations.  He remains within a budget,41 and generally has 
a monthly balance of about $1,694.68 in discretionary funds available for his use.42 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
Administrative Judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common

sense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of 
a number of variables known as the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge 
must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has 
produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, 
the Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, 
explanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government’s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to 
suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
43 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                          
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, AG & 19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of same” may raise security 
concerns as well. Applicant’s admissions and submissions establish evidence to 
substantiate SOR ¶¶ 1.a. (and the corresponding 1.j.), 1.l., and 1.n., as well as 1.g. 
through 1.i., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n. The Government evidence, along with Applicant’s 
denials, fails to establish sufficient evidence to substantiate the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. 
through 1.f., or 1.m. as Applicant’s delinquent debts.  
 
The Government attributes substantial importance and credibility to entries in the 
two credit reports in evidence. I have reviewed them, and even with extensive 
experience in deciphering the entries, found them to be garbled and internally 
inconsistent, with minimum indicia of reliability.  There is no indication as to the 
source(s) of the information appearing therein, for as the Equifax Credit Report states, 
the entries are derived from “public records or other information” without identifying the 
“other information.”44 It provides even less information about the sources of the 
derogatory financial information.  The combined report does not disclose even that 
much information. 
 
As noted, the credit reports contain duplicate entries seemingly reflecting one 
account opened by a creditor and another by a collection agent; information which is not 
verified as accurate; information which may not apply to Applicant; information which is 
incomplete or not current; and information which appears in one report but not in the 
other. Thus, the factual or legal accuracy, currency, or reliability of the information is left 
to mere speculation. Accordingly, I find they are unreliable and untrustworthy, and in 
this particular instance, inaccurate as well.  In the absence of creditor statements of 
account or other more reliable, accurate, and trustworthy evidence, including Applicant’s 
admissions, I decline to accept as accurate and trustworthy allegations in credit reports 
challenged or contradicted by Applicant’s denials. 
 
Applicant did experience an inability to keep up with the payments on his 
automobile and, in 2005, offered it back to the creditor as a voluntary repossession.  His 
delay until 2008 in commencing to make payments on the remaining balance 
constitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations. The disputes regarding child

support arrearage and the “untimely” disputed checking account, both fall within a 
purported history of not meeting financial obligations. The above actions are sufficient to 
raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  
 
However, the issue pertaining to the federal tax liens is a different matter.  The 
federal tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1991-92, but there is no 
described basis for those filings, and with Applicant’s denials to the allegations and 
contentions that he had filed his income tax returns, there is no evidence to establish a 
failure by Applicant to file annual income tax returns as required in AG & 19(g).  
Moreover, two of those liens were released within three months of being filed, and the 
remaining lien was released within 12 months. There is no evidence to substantiate the 
allegations that delinquent balances remain as of November 2006 as a result of these 
liens. Furthermore, legally, they should not currently appear in his credit report. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s 
2005 inability to make his monthly automobile payments, and the absence of repayment 
arrangements until 2008, is the single most potentially troublesome issue. The child 
support arrearage, when considering the circumstances at the time, with Applicant 
informally paying child support but disappointing the mother of his child, and the 
ensuing court action, is not as troublesome. Neither of these circumstances currently 
exists. I find the behavior is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I find AG ¶ 20(a) applies in this 
case.  
 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ 
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, the first section of AG & 20(c) 
is not in issue for there is no evidence of Applicant having received counseling for 
financial issues. However, there are clear indications that his financial issues have been 
resolved or are under control.  Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@45 Applicant generally has a monthly balance of about $1,694.68 in 
45 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

discretionary funds available for his use. He previously satisfied the child support 
arrearage and is now current in his child support payments. He previously voluntarily 
relinquished his automobile to the creditor and has now entered into a payment 
arrangement to satisfy the remaining balance. His actions in addressing his debts 
indicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear indications the problem is 
now largely under control.  I find AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply in this case. 
 
Under AG & 20(e), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.”  As noted above, 
Applicant followed up on the remaining accounts set forth in the SOR allegations and 
determined there were zero balances, or the accounts were not his, or he could not 
identify the creditors.  He has provided written statements and testimony describing his 
actions and the result of those actions. I have considered his oral and written 
statements and examined his demeanor, and consider him to be candid, truthful, and 
credible.  He acted responsibly in identifying and eventually resolving his debts. I find 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies in this case.  
 
The Government appears concerned that Applicant purportedly permitted his 
credit card (SOR ¶ 1.k.), checking account (SOR ¶ 1.l.), and auto insurance account 
(SOR ¶ 1.m.) to be either “charged-off”46 or sent to collection.  Applicant has disputed or 
explained those actions.  It appears the debts were never reduced to judgments.  In 
each case, the creditors located in Florida, merely charged the delinquent balances off 
or sent the accounts to collection in 2000-03. While the credit reports may reflect the 
balances as delinquent, as of the date of the hearing in March 2008, it appears the 
debts are barred by Florida’s 5-year statute of limitations,47 making them legally 
uncollectible.48  Applicant is financially sound and prepared for future contingencies.

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
46 It is commonly acknowledged that a “charge off” is a practice where the creditor gives up on collection 
efforts, takes a tax write-off on the debt, and/or sells the debt to a third party.  The debt still exists, but the creditor has 
received a tax benefit and possibly sold the debt to the third party.  The debt may or may not be legally collectible.

48 The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of 
the statute of limitations: 
 
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate activity, 
punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The 
cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to 
promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential 
defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend 
time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  
Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.

Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has taken affirmative 
action and made substantial good-faith efforts to pay off or resolve his legitimate 
delinquent debts, including those raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it 
is the Government’s contentions that he still has outstanding debts identified in the 
SOR, those debts were never reduced to judgments and the Statute of Limitations for 
each of the debts has expired, making them uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, 
these debts cannot be sources of improper pressure or duress. 
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether 
his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.49 Considering his continuing good-faith efforts, the circumstances behind 
some of the debts, the nature of some of the legitimate debts, and the 
inappropriateness of some of the debts listed in the credit reports, his past financial 
situation is insufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.

clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
