Decision 
______________ 
 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 20, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an e-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On December 
21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 16, 2008.1 In a sworn, 
written statement, notarized February 2, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing. However, on February 13, 2008, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.7., Enclosure 3 of the 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Department Counsel requested a hearing 
before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on February 14, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on 
February 15, 2008. Applicant was unavailable to attend a hearing tentatively scheduled 
for mid-March 2008, so a Notice of Hearing was issued on March 31, 2008, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on May 7, 2008. 
 
During the hearing, nine Government exhibits and seven Applicant exhibits were 
received without objection, and Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) 
was received on May 16, 2008.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven of the factual allegations in 
¶¶ 1.g. through 1.m. of the SOR.  He denied all other allegations with explanations.  
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance. He was previously granted a SECRET clearance in 
December 1981, and access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in 
September 1992,2 and has retained his clearance and access through periodic 
reinvestigations.  He was married to his first wife from 1986 until her death in 2003, and 
married his current spouse in 2004. He has two children and two step-children. 
 
Applicant earned a B.S. in Electronic Engineering in 1982, and as of February 
2006, was still entered in a program leading to an M.S. in Engineering Management, 
although he has not taken a class since late 2002. From March 1994 until the present, 
Applicant has been gainfully employed, initially as a software engineer and currently as 
a senior staff software engineer, by a major defense contractor and its successor.3  He 
1 Applicant erroneously wrote the date as 2007.

is highly respected by management and co-workers for his character, trustworthiness, 
and integrity. 
 
Without his knowledge, Applicant’s financial difficulties actually commenced 
when he followed his father’s recommendation to invest in a limited partnership 
business venture involving genetic engineering of cattle in about 1982.4  At the time he 
entered into the venture, the U.S. Government was offering tax incentives for such 
investments.5  Applicant believes there were approximately 4,000 initial investors in the 
venture.6 He invested several thousand dollars on an annual basis, and when he filed 
his state and federal income tax returns, reviewed by both an accountant and an 
attorney,7 claimed the appropriate business deductions, resulting in tax credits or 
business losses.8  Those credits and losses off set income taxes on his other sources of 
income, including his salary, and he received refunds of all taxes previously withheld 
based on his salary.9 For an unspecified period, Applicant claimed to be exempt and 
that claim resulted in having no income taxes withheld from his salary.10  However, at 
some point, believed by Applicant to have been in about 1986-87, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) informed him that the claim of exemption was not appropriate so he 
increased his exemptions.11 
 
 The IRS eventually notified the investors that it would disallow all partnership 
deductions.12 That notice was followed up by investigations of the venture by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).13 Despite the controversy, he was advised by 
persons unspecified that the partnership attorneys and the IRS would eventually settle 
 
 
4 Government Exhibit 8 (Statement of Subject, dated Jul. 19, 1995), at 1; But see also Answer to SOR, 
dated Jan. 29, 2008, at 1, wherein Applicant claims he started investing in 1978, while still in college.  During the 
hearing, Applicant stated his father had started investing in the venture in the mid-1970s. (Tr. at 27)  While the 
specific date is not material, the facts supporting the later date are: (1) Applicant furnished the 1982 date in 1995, 
which was only 13 years after the fact, while the 1978 date was furnished in 2008, or approximately 30 years after the 
fact; and (2) in 1995, the IRS challenged the business deductions commencing in 1982, and did not go back to an 
earlier date.

the matter.14 Nevertheless, litigation ensued involving other partners, but Applicant was 
not a party. Based on the advice of Applicant’s attorney, both Applicant and his father 
ceased their respective investments in the venture in about 1991-92.15 
 
Tax audits conducted by the IRS resulted in all of Applicant’s previous venture-
related deductions being denied, and he was assessed large accumulated interest and 
penalty balances for the tax years 1982 through 1986.16 Large deficiencies were also 
proposed for the tax years 1987 through 1995.17 In 1995, federal and state tax liens 
were placed against his property on several occasions, and the IRS levied his wages 
and a savings account.18 Because of the loss of salary and savings, through 
garnishment or levy, to offset his tax deficiencies, he began to experience substantial 
financial difficulties and used credit cards to meet living expenses.19 
 
Applicant subsequently sold stock to pay off some credit cards20 and, to resolve 
a tax issue with the state, voluntarily agreed to the sale of a timeshare to satisfy the 
balance.21 He also cooperated with the IRS, and by a combination of agreed payment 
arrangements, and relatively recent overpaid income taxes which would be applied to 
his unpaid balances, he has been addressing them as well.22  Despite his financial 
difficulties, Applicant has managed to remain current in all his other accounts.23  
 
Although some of the issues regarding the limited partnership were before the 
U.S. Tax Court, the matter was subsequently dismissed.  Applicant’s attorney advised 
him the IRS had decided not to pursue the matter any further, and the liens had 
expired.24   
 
The SOR identified 13 allegations, including 10 which purportedly refer to 
continuing delinquencies. Applicant contends several of the allegations refer to tax liens

which were, in his opinion, not legitimate because the lien had expired or the balance 
had been paid off.  Some of his contentions have merit. The evidence and information 
offered by the Government consists of two written statements by Applicant, his answers 
to SOR and to the interrogatories, two credit reports, and notices and correspondence 
from the IRS and the state taxing authority.  The 13 debts listed in the SOR, and their 
respective purported current status, according to the totality of the combined evidence, 
as well as Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:

Thus, it appears that Applicant has satisfied, either through direct payments, 
garnished wages, or tax overpayments, before the SOR was issued, the delinquencies 
identified in each of the allegations set forth in the SOR except for those in SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 
1.c., and 1.d.  They refer to the refiled (in December 1998) federal tax liens covering the 
tax periods 1982-85, which Applicant contends have expired, and a wage garnishment 
for a period covered by some of those liens (under 1.i.). In fact, the federal tax lien for 
1982-85 continues in force until December  2008, unless it is released prior thereto.  As

for the alleged garnishment in SOR ¶ 1.i., the Government evidence seemingly 
duplicates the evidence pertaining to federal tax liens covering the same period.  
 
The Government has relied, in part, on two credit reports and a LexisNexis® 
Internet search,45 as well as upon documents requested of Applicant in response to 
interrogatories pertaining to some tax liens which had allegedly been filed 12-15 years 
ago. Equifax furnished a 2007 Credit Report46 and a 2008 Credit Report.47 While both 
credit reports list the same five “current” liens and one released lien, the information 
appearing in the credit reports is inaccurate and incomplete. Moreover, the LexisNexis® 
Internet search revealed only the most superficial information about five federal tax 
liens, but fails to furnish the most salient of information: (1) what was the basis for the 
lien, and (2) what is the current status of the lien. 
 
Applicant remains within a budget,48 and generally has a monthly balance of 
about $3,126.00 in discretionary funds available for his use.49  His most recent federal 
income tax filing is anticipated to result in a refund of about $9,000.50 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
Administrative Judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of 
a number of variables known as the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge 
must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
45Government Exhibit 3 (LexisNexis® Internet Search, dated Dec. 12, 2007).

decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has 
produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, 
the Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, 
explanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government’s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to 
suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
51 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1). 
 
9 
                                      
 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, AG & 19(d), “deceptive or illegal financial practices such as 
embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account 
fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust,”  
(emphasis supplied) and AG & 19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of same” may raise security 
concerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to substantiate the debts and delinquencies 
set forth in each of the SOR allegations.  
 
Without much warning, following tax audits, the IRS “hit” Applicant with 
substantial income tax, penalties, and interest because of his involvement in a 
previously approved investment in a limited partnership business venture which the IRS 
subsequently disallowed. Because of a dispute as to the IRS action, and listening to the 
legal advice of his attorney, the investment advice of the managing partners, and 
awaiting a decision by the U.S. Tax Court – a decision which never materialized 
because the litigation was dismissed – Applicant initially took no action in addressing 
the IRS actions. As a result of his initial inaction, the balances grew, wage garnishments 
were executed, and tax liens were filed. In one instance during this entire situation, but 
unrelated to it, Applicant overlooked the taxes on a timeshare. When it became 
apparent the IRS position would not change, Applicant was not immediately able to 
satisfy the demanded balances, and his delay in commencing to make payments on 
those balances constitute both an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and a history 
of not meeting financial obligations. The above actions are sufficient to raise these 
potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  
 
The issue pertaining to the federal and state tax liens is a different matter.  The 
federal and state tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1995-96, and some 
of the federal tax liens were refiled in 1998. There is no evidence to establish a failure 
by Applicant to file annual income tax returns as required in AG & 19(g), and the 
evidence supports the opposite conclusion. Likewise, in the absence of a scintilla of 
evidence indicating any criminal action by Applicant, his actions in taking the business 
deductions, resulting in tax credits or business losses, and setting off income taxes on 
his other sources of income, does not constitute a “fraudulent filing” of income tax 
returns or “income tax evasion.” Moreover, the state income tax liens covering 1983-86, 
and the state tax deficiency for the timeshare were released or otherwise satisfied in 
1999-2000.  The federal tax liens covering 1986, 1993, and 1994, as well as the tax 
deficiencies covering 1992-94, and 1999, were all satisfied in 2006.  The federal tax 
liens covering 1982-85 were to have expired several years ago and Applicant was 
convinced they had expired so he took no action on them.  They were actually refiled in 
1998. Applicant has now realized his error and is prepared to continue his efforts to 
satisfy those liens, but he has been advised by his attorney that the IRS is expected to 
allow the liens to expire in December 2008 without further action.  I find AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c) apply in this case.

The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances” may raise security concerns as well. 
 
Applicant=s initial participation in the business venture commenced because of 
the advice and guidance he had received from his father and an attorney, as well as 
based on the information he had received from the managing partners.  Finally, after the 
IRS had altered its original position regarding the venture, and once again relying on the 
advice he received from his father and an attorney, his participation ceased in about 
1991-92, and has not been resumed.  Given Applicant’s harsh lesson learned, and the 
money his investments have cost him, I find the behavior is unlikely to recur, and it does 
not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I find 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply in this case.  
 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ 
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, there is clear evidence of 
Applicant having received counseling for his financial issues from his father and his 
attorney, as well as experience gathered from the IRS interpretation and guidance of 
the law. Moreover, based on his actions, and elimination of the business venture from 
his continuing activities, there are clear indications that his financial issues have been 
resolved, are being resolved, or are under control.  He no longer has anything to do with 
the venture and has tried to put the experience behind him. 
 
Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@52 As noted 
above, Applicant sold stock to pay off some credit cards and, to resolve a tax issue with 
the state, sold a timeshare to generate enough money to satisfy the balance owed. He 
52 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

also cooperated with the IRS, and by a combination of agreed payment arrangements, 
and overpaid income taxes to be applied to his unpaid balances, he began addressing 
them as well. To his credit, despite his investment-related financial difficulties, Applicant 
has managed to remain current in all his other accounts, and currently generally has a 
monthly balance of about $3,126 in discretionary funds available for his use. He 
anticipated a $9,000 refund from his most recent income tax filing. While there is still a 
pending federal tax lien covering the years 1982-85, he is clearly on his way to resolving 
his financial delinquencies and has made tremendous strides in doing so. His actions in 
addressing his debts indicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear 
indications the problem is now largely under control.  I find AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply 
in this case. 
 
Under AG & 20(e), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.” What was once 
a legally acceptable business venture in the eyes of the IRS became an unacceptable 
business venture. The U.S. Tax Court became involved, but the litigation was 
dismissed. Applicant was advised that the venture was legal, and then advised the 
controversy would be settled. Consistent with the guidance he received from various 
quarters, Applicant believed the tax liens were not legitimate, and he stood his ground.  
However, he has now accepted the newly revised reality.  He has provided written 
statements and testimony describing his actions and the result of those actions. I have 
considered his oral and written statements and examined his demeanor, and consider 
him to be candid, truthful, and credible.  In these particular circumstances, he acted 
responsibly. I find AG ¶ 20(e) applies in this case.  
 
It appears several of the SOR allegations duplicate other allegations. SOR ¶ 1.a. 
($159,621) refers to the tax years 1982-85. SOR ¶ 1.c. ($31,129) refers to the tax year 
1982, which is also part of the other lien. SOR ¶ 1.d. ($76,216) refers to 1983-85, which 
is also included in the first lien. SOR ¶ 1.i. ($112,450) refers to a federal wage 
garnishment on the large amount covering several of the same tax years, plus 1986, but 
the garnishment was cancelled after $1,000 was taken. By alleging each of the above 
amounts separately, without specifying the individual tax years involved, or by failing to 
acknowledge payments already made or resulting official actions already taken, such as 
release of liens or cancellation of garnishments, the balance owed is made to appear 
considerably larger than the true balance. Furthermore, the general lack of specificity or 
accuracy in the allegations fail to furnish full notice to Applicant and merely serve to 
confuse the issues. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
12 
                                      
 
                                                          
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. On the recommendations of his 
father, counseling by an attorney, and with the guidance that the investment was 
legitimate, Applicant participated in the venture. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Upon learning of 
the revised IRS position regarding the investment, and with the advice of an attorney, 
Applicant ceased his participation in the venture in about 1991-92. (See AG & 2(a)(3).) 
Since undergoing tax audits, and having federal and state tax liens filed and 
garnishments established, he has taken affirmative action and made substantial good-
faith efforts to pay off or resolve his debts. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it is true there are 
still liens covering the tax years 1982-85, those liens did not result in a current levy and, 
while the liens were refiled in 1998, they are expected to expire in December 2008 
without further IRS action, making the amounts specified uncollectible. (See AG & 
2(a)(8).) Thus, these debts cannot be sources of improper pressure or duress.  Finally, 
because of the lessons learned, and considering his monetary losses, the behavior is 
unlikely to recur.  (See AG & 2(a)(9).) 
 
The issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether his 
financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I 
have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record 
evidence.53 Considering his continuing good-faith efforts, the circumstances behind the 
liens and garnishments, the duplication of some of those debts in the SOR, his 
continuing to receive and hold a security clearance and access to SCI throughout this 
entire financial situation without cause for alarm, and his current financial status 
regarding other accounts which never fell into delinquency, his past financial situation, 
and to a degree, the present federal tax liens which are about to expire, is insufficient to 
raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
