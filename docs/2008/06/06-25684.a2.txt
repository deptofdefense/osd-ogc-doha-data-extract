On March 21, 2008, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision in this case.  On April 14,
2008, Applicant submitted a request for reconsideration of this decision.  Department Counsel
submitted a response on April 17, 2008.  
The Board has inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider its decisions.  However,
there is no right to reconsideration; the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise
its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0621 at 1-2 (App.
Bd. Nov. 23, 1999).  
Applicant requests that the Board reconsider its prior decision and grant him a security
clearance, arguing that he had successfully mitigated the Guideline G security concerns in his case.
In the alternative Applicant requests that the Board direct that the hearing be reopened so he can
present additional evidence.
The Board has considered Applicant’s brief and Department Counsel’s reply brief in light
of our prior decision.  Applicant has failed to articulate a persuasive reason to change the Board’s
resolution of his case or to allow a reopening of the record.  See ISCR Case No. 03-21012 at 1 (App.
Bd. Sep. 20, 2005).  Accordingly Applicant’s request is denied.
