HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-
QIP) on February 4, 2006. On November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On December 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be 
decided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material 
(FORM) on February 6, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on February 7, 
2008. Applicant received the FORM on March 3, 2008.  He had 30 days from receipt of 
the FORM to submit any additional material.  He did not respond to the FORM. The 
FORM was forwarded to the hearing office on April 29, 2008 and assigned to me on 
 
2 
 
 
May 2, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

(SOR ¶ 1.z; Item 7 at 5); a $9,327 delinquent account placed for collection in 
September 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.aa; Item 7 at 9); a $5,233 delinquent account placed for

at 6); and a $472 judgment entered in December 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.ag; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 
at 3; Item 8 at 1.)  
 
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant did not explain why he denies the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t, 
1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 1.aa, 1.ab, 1.ac, 1.ae, 1.af, and 1.ag.  He did not provide information on 
the status of any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not provide information as to 
what caused his financial problems. He did not provide information about his current 
financial status, such as a monthly budget.  He did not provide information about his 
work performance.       
 
Based on the record evidence, I find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 1.j 
because the credit report dated, January 13, 2007, lists the debt as paid. (Item 7 at 19.) 
I find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 1.r because it is a duplicate of the debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.aa.  SOR ¶ 1.aa lists the most recent creditor and balance. (Item 6 at 8; Item 
7 at 9, 16.)   
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
 
4 
 
 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations); apply to Applicant’s case. Since 2000, Applicant has a history of 
not meeting financial obligations. He incurred 32 delinquent accounts, an approximate 
total balance of $49,126.  
 
5 
 
 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has provided no information as to what caused his financial problems and 
what steps, if any, have been taken to resolve his financial situation.  
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) cannot be applied. There is nothing in the 
record evidence suggesting the applicability of FC MC ¶ 20(b).  
 
     FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial 
counseling and no information was provided regarding steps taken to resolve his 
financial situation.  
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.j because a January 13, 2007 credit report indicates the debt was paid.  However, at 
the close of the record, the status of 31 delinquent accounts, an approximate total of 
$44,122 remained uncertain. I cannot conclude that Applicant initiated a good-faith 
effort to resolve his overdue accounts.     
 
 FC MC ¶20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) does not apply. While Applicant denies 25 of the debts alleged in the SOR, he 
provided no explanation as to why he denies them and/or supporting documentation 
which indicates he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due 
debts.   
 
Under the revised AG, the overall concern under financial considerations is not 
only whether a person who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds, but also the failure or inability to live within one’s means, 
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information.  Applicant’s failure to honor his financial obligations to his creditors remains 
a security concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial 
considerations.  
 
 
6 
 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided no 
information about his current financial situation or the status of his delinquent debts. 
There is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
raised under financial considerations.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
