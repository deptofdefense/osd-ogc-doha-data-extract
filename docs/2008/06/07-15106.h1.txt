Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 17, 2008. He
admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, denied the
remaining allegations, and requested a hearing.
The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on
May 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2008.  The hearing was conducted as2
scheduled. The government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as

 Applicant’s credit reports, GE 4 and GE 5, disclose the dates alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b

are reversed. Additionally, while the amount alleged in subparagraph 1.a is $1,873, the credit reports indicate
the actual amount owing on the February 2005 judgment is in excess of $4,000. The amount alleged in the
SOR rather than the amount listed in the credit reports is used herein in computing the total amount owed on
the judgments.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified, called one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted 1 documentary exhibit
that was marked as Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the record without
objection. The transcript was received on June 2, 2008.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant is 57 years old and has been employed as a mechanical engineer by a
defense contractor since February 2007. He retired from employment with a different
defense contractor in February 2007. Applicant has possessed a secret level security
clearance at various times for the past 28 years. No prior adverse action has been taken
to revoke or downgrade his clearance.
Applicant married the first time in December 1992. That marriage ended in divorce
in March 2003. He has two children from that marriage, ages 13 and 14, and pays $1,408
per month as child support. He has been remarried since March 2003, and has an 11-year-
old stepchild from this marriage. His wife does not work outside the house.    
SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c allege three judgments entered against
Applicant, totaling over $12,000.  Each judgment arose from delinquent credit card debt,3
and each judgment was entered in 2005. Applicant has done nothing to satisfy any of the
judgments. 
Subparagraph 1.d alleges a collection account owing in the amount of $157. This
account arose from a cell phone bill and has been delinquent since at least 2005. Applicant
has done nothing to resolve this account.
Subparagraph 1.e alleges a medical bill that was submitted for collection in or about
December 2007. Applicant credibly testified this bill should have been covered by medical
insurance and that it is now in the process of being paid by the insurance company.
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.h allege three charged off credit card debts, totaling
over $14,600. Applicant testified he did not recognize the creditors listed on those accounts
and, based on similarities in the amounts owing, assumes they are duplicates of the debts
alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c. (Tr. 35-38) He did not submit any evidence in
support of those assumptions and admitted he has not even bothered to dispute the
accounts with the various credit reporting agencies. (Tr. 38)

Applicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce, the resulting child support,
and a three-month layoff he experienced in 2002. He submitted a personal financial
statement (AE 1) in which he listed his March 2003 net monthly income as $4,553, net
monthly expenses as $6,364, and his net monthly deficit as $1,811. In the same document,
he listed his January 2008 net monthly income as $6,178.33, his net monthly expenses as
$6,433.21, and his net monthly deficit as $254. He does not have a plan to resolve his
delinquent debt nor to get his monthly income and expenses in order.    
POLICIES
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial
considerations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case.
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of4 5
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the7
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to8
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable9
clearance decision.10

No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard11
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access12
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      13
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant admits he has three outstanding judgments and one outstanding collection
account totalling over $12,000. He denies liability for the three charged off credit card
accounts, totalling over $14,000, based on his assumption that they are duplicates of the
judgments. He did not offer any evidence in support of those assumptions and has not
done anything to dispute the validity of those debts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a):
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial
obligations apply.
Applicant credibly testified the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e is being resolved
by his medical insurance company. However, he has done nothing to resolve any of the
other alleged debts and has no plan to do so in the future. He has allowed each of the
accounts to remain delinquent for years without taking any action to satisfy any of them.
He continues to spend more each month than he earns and hasn’t figured out a way to
resolve that continuing financial dilemma. I have considered all mitigating conditions and
find that none apply. 
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
his acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and
5
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. He has neither overcome the case against
him nor  satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against
Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-d Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.f-h: Against Applicant
Conclusion  
             
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
