Decision 
______________ 
 
 
FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted her security clearance application on May 23, 2006. On 
March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The 
action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2008; answered it on 
April 14, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed on April 25, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on 
April 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 30, 2008, scheduling the 
hearing for May 20, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits 
(GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her 
 
2 
 
 
own behalf. I granted Applicant’s request to keep the record open until June 20, 2008 to 
enable her to submit documentary evidence, but she submitted nothing. DOHA received 
the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 2, 2008. The record closed on June 20, 2008. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Evidentiary Ruling 
 
 Department Counsel offered GX 6, a personal subject interview extracted from a 
report of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the 
Directive ¶ E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and she 
waived it (Tr. 26). Accordingly, I admitted GX 6 without authentication.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a that 
she previously received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. She admitted the delinquent 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.i, 1.q, 1.s, and 1.t. She admitted the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j through 1.o and 1.y, but she disputed the amounts. Her 
admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings 
of fact. I make the following findings: 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor. She has 
worked for her current employer since April 2006. She has an associate’s degree in 
electronics engineering. She was married in October 1982 and divorced in January 
1986. She served in the U.S. Navy Reserve from April 1987 to January 2002. She holds 
an interim clearance, but she has never held a final security clearance. 
 
 The Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a occurred in January 
1998, after a break-up of a domestic relationship. All the debts were in Applicant’s 
name, and she could not afford to pay them alone. On the advice of an attorney, she 
filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy in September 1997 and received a discharge in 
January 1998 (Tr. 47). 
 
 The SOR alleges 26 debts totaling about $44,861. In her answer to the SOR, she 
presented evidence that the four student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.u, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.x 
were no longer delinquent, leaving 22 delinquent debts totaling $32,244. Of these 22 
debts, 10 are for medical expenses. Applicant was diagnosed as epileptic in 2002, and 
most of the medical expenses were incurred for treatment while she did not have 
medical insurance (Tr. 30). Applicant testified she believes the medical debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are the same debt, but she did not provide any documentation to 
support her belief (Tr. 50). Applicant applied for a grant to pay the hospital bill alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.b, but the paperwork was lost and she did not follow up. She admitted she 
“dropped the ball” in resolving this debt (Tr. 49). 
 
 Applicant moved from the west coast to the northeastern U.S. in December 2002 
at her own expense, to pursue a personal relationship (Tr. 37). In June 2003, six 
 
3 
 
 
months after her move, she was laid off (Tr. 29-30). She immediately found other 
employment, but she quit her job in September 2003 because of a disagreement over 
her eligibility for overtime pay (Tr. 38). She was unemployed until January 2004 and 
could not draw unemployment benefits because she had voluntarily left her job (Tr. 40). 
After January 2004, she was employed steadily until March 2006 when she was 
terminated because of a disagreement with her district manager over the scope of her 
authority (Tr. 43). After a break of about four weeks, she began working for her current 
employer (Tr. 44).  
 
 Applicant has a domestic partner, and she pays most of her partner’s living 
expenses, including her partner’s car insurance (GX 6 at 3). Her partner has elected to 
provide unpaid child care for her grandchildren instead of working outside the home (Tr. 
54). 
 
 The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the 
table below.

 Applicant’s monthly take-home pay at her current job is about $2,600 (Tr. 69). 
She testified she lives paycheck to paycheck (Tr. 55). She is paying $50 per month 
more than is required on her student loans, but is not making payments on any other 
delinquent debts. She has no active credit card accounts (Tr. 73). She drives an eight-
year-old car that she paid for with an income tax refund (Tr. 71-72). She has not 
participated in any financial counseling (Tr. 76). 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
 
5 
 
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG ¶ 19(a) is raised where there is an 
Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG ¶ 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is 
raised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and 
the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a 
realistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG ¶ 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not 
meeting financial obligations.@ AG ¶ 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending 
beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ 
Applicant’s financial history raises AG ¶¶ 19(a), (c) and (e). AG ¶ 19(b) is not raised 
because there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending. 
 
 Since the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An 
applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving 
it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).

Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG ¶ 20(a). This condition is not 
established, because Applicant has numerous debts that are currently delinquent, and 
her marginal financial situation makes continued or further delinquencies likely. At 
present, she lives from paycheck to paycheck, with virtually nothing in reserve for 
unexpected expenses.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.@ AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established.  
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy in January 1998 was the result of a domestic breakup, a 
circumstance beyond her control, and it was a reasonable response to her financial 
situation. Applicant’s medical bills were circumstances beyond her control, but in 
several instances her lack of medical insurance was due to her voluntary decision to 
quit a job or change jobs. Her unemployment from September 2003 to January 2004 
was not a circumstance beyond her control, because it was the result of her decision to 
quit her job. Her four-week period of unemployment in 2006 was a circumstance beyond 
her control, but many of the debts were already delinquent at the time. Although 
Applicant has been employed steadily for more than two years, she has done virtually 
nothing to settle or pay her debts, except for her student loans. She has not sought 
professional help. She admitted at the hearing that she “dropped the ball” on an 
opportunity for a grant that would have covered her largest medical debt. I conclude that 
the second prong of AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought financial 
counseling.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.@ AG ¶ 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in 
a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or 
obligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). 
With the exception of her student loans, Applicant has done virtually nothing to resolve 
her debts. I conclude AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
 
7 
 
 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG ¶ 20(e). Applicant 
asserted at the hearing that she disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.r, and 1.z, 
but she provided no documentation, either at the hearing or during the period the record 
was kept open after the hearing. AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in 
AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is an intelligent woman. She was sincere, open, and credible at the 
hearing. Unfortunately, she has been unwilling or unable to take a systematic, 
aggressive, disciplined approach to her financial situation. Except for her student loans, 
she has done virtually nothing to resolve her delinquent debts. She brought no 
documentation to the hearing, even though she had been questioned repeatedly about 
her financial situation before the hearing and knew that her debts raised security 
concerns. She presented no evidence after the hearing even though the record was 
kept open at her request.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set 
forth in the SOR, as required by Directive ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: 
 
8 
 
 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.t:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.u-1.x:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.y-1.z:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.aa:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
