Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke her
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order
and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 28, 2008. The SOR is equivalent
to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues
in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of
financial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.
In addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.
The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective
  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(December 29, 2005). 
 The SOR has ¶¶ 1.a–1.bb, but mistakenly omits ¶ 1.s. 3
2
September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2
to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR
has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision2
or amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the
effective date.  
Applicant’s Answer was received on February 25, 2008, and she requested a
hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took place as
scheduled on May 15, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 27, 2008.
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of
multiple unpaid delinquent debts (credit card accounts, phone bills, medical bills, and
other consumer accounts) ranging from a low of $23 to a high of $4,310 for a total of
about $16,000.  Her Answer was mixed, but in essence she admits the debts, but3
disputes the status as will be discussed below. Also, she provided an explanation for
each debt. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established
by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
this company as a computer technician since April 2006. She is seeking to obtain an
industrial security clearance for the first time.  
Applicant married in 1994, divorced in 2000, and married her current husband in
2004. She has two children, a daughter who is now 16 years old and a son who is now
14 years old. Applicant has received $200 per month in child support since the divorce
was final in 2000. 
Applicant has lived in the same community since about 1997. While separated
from her first husband, she decided to return to college to further her education to
support her children. She had previously  attended a community college and earned an
associate’s degree in office administration. From August 1999 to May 2003, she
attended a local state university and earned a bachelor’s degree in business
administration. In addition to her studies, she worked as a customer service associate at
a large retail store from July 1999 to November 2004. She worked her way up to the
position of head cashier and the responsibilities that went with it. Applicant lived on
limited financial resources while attending school and working at the retail store. This
circumstance resulted in Applicant moving into public housing, and she also used credit
cards to finance living expenses. 
3
After she earned her bachelor’s degree, she was unable to obtain an job in her
chosen field of information technology (IT) due to lack of experience. So, in September
2004 she took a job as a teacher’s assistant at a local school. She earned about the
same as working at the retail store, but the job came with benefits. She worked at the
school until July 2005 when she secured an IT position as a computer lab technician in
the same school system. She worked there until she started her current employment as
a computer technician in April 2006. 
In general, Applicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not
dispute (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4). She described her actions to resolve the debts in her
Answer and hearing testimony (Tr. 29–49). The debts and her supporting evidence are
summarized in the following table.

To sum up, Applicant is now repaying three accounts, and she has paid, settled, or
resolved the other debts at issue except for the two medical collection accounts in ¶¶ 1.f
and 1.g. Her plan is to address these two accounts when she completes the current
repayment agreements (Tr. 56–57). Government counsel conceded that the four
accounts described as duplicates are in fact duplications (Tr. 71).

Her gross income for 2007 was approximately $30,000 (Tr. 65). She and her
husband manage their money via a single joint checking account, and her husband has
assumed primary responsibility for bill paying and is helping her pay bills on time and
clean up her credit record (Tr. 66). Monthly rent and car payments are current as are
state and federal taxes (Tr. 67–69). 
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an5
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any6
existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any
level and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order7
10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting8
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An9
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate10
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme11
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12

 Revised Guidelines at 13–14 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating15
conditions). 
 Revised Guidelines at 13. 16
 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 17
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 18

The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination14
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically15
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be16
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it
indicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations17 18
within the meaning of Guideline F. The multiple delinquent accounts described above
are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Likewise, the
same facts and circumstances support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. 
 Revised Guidelines at 14. 19
7
The guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.19
The six mitigating conditions are as follows: 
MC 1–the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
MC 2–the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
MC 3–the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
MC 4–the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
MC 5–the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,
MC 6–the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent MC to this case is MC 4—good-faith effort to repay—and it
applies in Applicant’s favor. She presented substantial evidence (both documentary
evidence and credible testimony) to demonstrate an intent to clean up her financial
house. As summarized in the table above: (1) she paid, settled, or resolved 18 debts;
(2) she is now repaying 3 debts; (3) she will address the 2 unpaid accounts when the
others are paid; and (4) 4 accounts are duplicates. Her actions show a documented,
measurable improvement to her overall financial condition. Also, it shows that Applicant
is both determined and serious. Based on the evidence, it is likely she will pay off the
outstanding debts in the near future. And it is important to note that Applicant took
action on many of the accounts before the SOR was issued in January 2008, which
further supports a conclusion of good-faith effort.  
To sum up under the whole-person concept, Applicant struggled financially after
her divorce while raising two children. To her credit, she worked hard, went back to
school and improved her job skills, and it appears she is now on a path toward career
success. She remarried a few years ago and her husband appears to be a stabilizing
8
factor in her life. Although she did not present a perfect case in mitigation by paying off
all the debts, she did present an adequate case in mitigation.  
To conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to
obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.bb: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
