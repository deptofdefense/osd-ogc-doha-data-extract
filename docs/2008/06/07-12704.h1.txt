GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 22, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an e-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On January 
22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 29, 2008. In a sworn, 
written statement, notarized February 17, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 13, 2008, and 
the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard on March 20, 2008. 
On March 27, 2008, because of caseload considerations, it was reassigned to me. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on March 31, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on May 6, 2008. During the hearing, three Government exhibits and four 
Applicant exhibits were received without objection, and Applicant testified. The 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 14, 2008. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.f., 1.h., 1.j., 1.m. through 1.o., 1.q. through 1.s., 1.v. through 1.x., and 1.z. 
through 1.bb., of the SOR, with explanations.  He failed to address ¶ 1.cc., and denied 
the remaining allegations. 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a senior 
help desk analyst in network administration,1 and he is seeking to retain a SECRET 
security clearance. He was initially granted such clearance in 1988.2 He was married to 
his first wife from 1981 until 1986, when they divorced, and has been married to his 
current wife since 1990.  He has five children.3 
 
Applicant served on active duty with the U.S. Army for over 15 years, with five 
months service in Southwest Asia during hostilities in 1991.4  He declined further

military service to avoid a second overseas deployment in 2000,5 and was given an 
honorable discharge.6 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about November 
1997, when, with an approved VA guaranteed loan of $176,128, he closed on a new 
home.7  One month later, his wife was laid off from her job.8 Since her salary covered 
the majority of their monthly expenses, his salary as an enlisted man, along with her 
unemployment checks, were insufficient to meet the family obligations.9 Creditors were 
unwilling to negotiate new payment arrangements, and bills eventually became 
delinquent.  His wife did manage to secure a position in April 1998. Nevertheless, in 
October 1998, Applicant’s debts, other than his residential mortgage loan, were 
discharged under Chapter 7 backruptcy.10 
 
For an extended period thereafter, Applicant’s wife experienced periodic periods 
of brief employment and unemployment.  The job she obtained in April 1998 lasted until 
June 1999, and she remained unemployed until December 1999.  In April 2000, his 
enlistment with the Army ended and he immediately entered the ranks of the 
unemployed.11 Unable to pay their mortgage, they relocated to an apartment and rented 
their home.  In October 2000, he entered the workforce again and remained gainfully 
employed until September 2001.12  His wife was again already laid off in May 2001, and 
remained unemployed until September 2001.13 After a month of unemployment, 
commencing in October 2001, and lasting until May 2003, Applicant held a series of 
jobs with different companies.14 Although he was again unemployed during May-
September 2003, he has been employed consistently since September 2003.15 
 
At one point, the tenants who were renting Applicant’s residence decided to end 
their lease and move.  Unfortunately, they had damaged the residence to such a degree 
that Applicant was unable to subsequently rent it or sell it.  It was foreclosed.16  In about

July 2001, Applicant relocated across the country to a location where his parents could 
provide temporary lodging and daycare for the children.17  They moved several times to 
shorten commuting time, because of tornado damage to one home they were renting, to 
address allergies, and to be in better school districts, and finally settled in a more 
expensive area with increased rent and utilities.18 
 
With diminished income during 1998-2003, his finances took an enormous hit.  
Payments were delayed and many of Applicant’s bills became delinquent. Applicant 
discussed his plight with his security officer and was referred to what Applicant 
characterized as “debt counseling.”19 In fact, it was a one day session on budget 
counseling conducted on February 12, 2008,20 after receipt of the SOR.  Purportedly, as 
a result of what he learned from the counseling, Applicant decided to not address his 
financial delinquencies because the delinquent balance was quite large and the debts 
would be removed from his credit reports after seven years from the date of the last 
activity.21  
 
During the periods of their respective employment, unemployment, and 
underemployment, Applicant and his wife attended educational institutions to improve 
their marketability for higher paying positions, and now each owes approximately 
$48,000 in student loans.22 His wife obtained her Bachelors and Masters degrees, and 
is currently working on her Ph.D.23 Applicant completed his B.S. in Information 
Technology in 2005, and his M.S. in the same discipline in March 2008.24 
 
Applicant and his wife both currently hold good positions that pay well.25  
According to his comments made during an interview in April 2007, they had a 
combined gross monthly income of $10,971, which worked out to a net income of nearly 
$9,000.26 After deducting approximately $8,000 in monthly expenses, including $1,118 
for martial arts and music for the children, $890 for day care, and $909 for car

expenses, he generally has less than $40 remaining for discretionary spending.27 
Applicant drives a 2005 Ford Explorer and his wife drives a 2005 Ford Expedition for 
which they pay $600 and $500, respectively, each month.28 
 
The SOR contained 29 allegations and identified 27 purportedly continuing 
delinquencies, including some duplicates. Those debts listed in the SOR, and their 
respective current status, according to the Credit Reports, dated October 24, 2007 (the 
most current one in evidence) and March 8, 2007, as well as Applicant’s Answer to

Although Applicant had indicated an intention to pay his delinquent debts in the 
past, most notably during his interview on April 18, 2007,29 as well as in his 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions, dated Feb. 22, 2007,30 it is well 
established that he has made no efforts to do so. Quite to the contrary, his inaction 
towards his delinquent debts and his continuing efforts in avoiding contact with his 
creditors so as not to interfere with the removal of such debts from his credit report after 
seven years of inactivity, support his newly stated intention that he will not satisfy his 
delinquent financial obligations.31  Over a period of about 10 years Applicant obtained 
services and goods from a wide variety of creditors. While there were periods of 
economic difficulty brought about by unemployment and underemployment, there were 
also periods of prosperity, and Applicant has continuously ignored even the smallest of 
his financial obligations. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially

disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
Administrative Judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of 
a number of variables known as the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge 
must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”32 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has 
produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, 
the Applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, 
explanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government’s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to 
suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
32 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial condition collapsed in December 1997, when his 
wife first lost her job. Although he remained on active duty until April 2000, his salary 
and her unemployment checks were insufficient to meet the family obligations, and bills 
eventually became delinquent. In October 1998, Applicant’s debts, other than his 
residential mortgage loan, were discharged under Chapter 7 backruptcy.  That enabled 
them to start all over with a clean financial slate.  Nevertheless, for an extended period 
of time, or until they were both fully employed in September 2003, more financial 
obligations were created only to, again, become delinquent because of his inability to 
satisfy them. 
 
Commencing in September 2003, and continuing until this date, Applicant and 
his wife have both been gainfully employed and currently earn a combined gross 
monthly income of $10,971. What was purportedly a willingness, accompanied by an 
inability, to satisfy debts, became more clearly an ability, accompanied by an 
unwillingness, to satisfy them.  Applicant’s clear intention is to ignore all his debts until 
such time as they are removed from his credit report.  AG && 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s 
financial situation collapsed in December 1997, but was restored with his bankruptcy in 
October 1998. Thereafter, he continued to accumulate substantial delinquent debt due, 
in large measure, to lengthy and sporadic unemployment and underemployment. The 
sporadic unemployment and underemployment circumstances are no longer present, 
and both he and his wife have been gainfully employed since September 2003. His 
refusal to address his financial delinquencies over the past five years raises concerns 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                          
about recurrence of delinquent debts and his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. The evidence fails to establish AG ¶ 20(a).  
 
Under AG & 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the financial problems arose initially 
because of his wife’s unemployment in December 1997.  But Applicant’s situation was 
seemingly resolved when most of his debts were discharged in bankruptcy in October 
1998.  His discharge from the Army and subsequent unemployment and his wife’s 
periodic unemployment and underemployment, only exacerbated his financial 
difficulties. He acted irresponsibly when he became unemployed and then refused to 
resolve his debts. His continuing refusal to satisfy even the smallest of his delinquent 
obligations since 2003, even though he and his wife are gainfully employed, tarnishes 
his actions as irresponsible. While the evidence regarding the period 1997-2003 initially 
established AG ¶ 20(a), the evidence of events since 2003 vitiates the applicability of 
this mitigating condition.  
 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ 
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the 
evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.@33 In February 2008, after receipt of the SOR, Applicant 
attended a budget counseling seminar. He decided to not address his financial 
delinquencies because the delinquent balance was quite large and the debts would be 
removed from his credit reports after seven years from the date of the last activity. In 
fact, that decision was clearly made after he and his wife became employed in 2003, 
and he failed to make any effort to address his debts.  In this instance, the budget 
counseling is insufficient to establish that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.  And, there is no credible evidence Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  The evidence fails to establish 
AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
33 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
Considering Applicant’s extensive financial delinquencies, which continue 
unaddressed, his focus on obtaining educational degrees, and his significant spending 
of discretionary funds for everything but his overdue debts, Applicant has not 
demonstrated his financial responsibility.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, 
Applicant was an active duty member of the U.S. Army and his wife was employed. She 
lost her job and entered periodic periods of employment and unemployment.  Unable to 
meet the family financial obligations, in October 1998, his debts were discharged in 
bankruptcy. Intending to avoid another overseas tour, he left military service and 
became unemployed. He also endured periods of employment and unemployment.  
While their underemployment and unemployment are circumstances beyond their 
control, Applicant obtained services and goods from a wide variety of creditors, but 
either had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he accumulated extensive 
new delinquent debt.  (See AG & 2(a)(1) and AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant and his wife 
have been gainfully employed since 2003, and while their combined gross monthly 
income is $10,971, he has refused to make any good-faith efforts to pay a variety of 
delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Instead, he preferred to wait for the debts to drop 
off his credit report after seven years of inactivity. (See AG & 2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and 
AG & 2(a)(9).) While these debts may eventually become uncollectible, failure to repay 
creditors reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security 
clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(5).) 
  
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether 
his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. 
I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s

credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.34 Considering what Applicant had gone through financially and emotionally 
during 1998-2003, and mindful of his 1998 bankruptcy, subsequent clean slate, the 
absence of any good-faith efforts, and his continuing refusal to address his debts, his 
current financial situation is sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 
2(a)(1).)   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.
