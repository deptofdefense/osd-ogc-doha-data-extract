Decision 
______________ 
 
LYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to deny his 
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. He has not mitigated 
concerns raised by his unresolved delinquent debt. Clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 17, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a 
security clearance.  
 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested an administrative 
determination. On August 17, 2017, Department Counsel sent Applicant the 
Government’s written case, known as a file of relevant material (FORM), which 
contained nine Items. Applicant received the FORM on August 23, 2017. Applicant did 
not respond to the FORM.  
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, implemented on September 1, 2006.

Procedural Matters 
 
 While the case was pending decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position. The 2017 AG superseded the AG implemented in September 2006, and they 
are effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have 
applied them in this case. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 42 years old, graduated from high school and attended college 
courses. He served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from 1992 to 2013. (Item 1) He is 
now a member of the inactive reserves.  He is married, but he has been separated 
since 2006.  He has one son and one stepchild. He has been employed by a Federal 
contractor since 2015. (Item 43)  He admits and his credit report shows five collection 
accounts for a total of about $29,728. (Items 5-8) Applicant has not provided any 
explanation for the delinquent debts. He was unemployed for under 30 days after he left 
the service, but has been employed full time. (Items 4, 9) He received unemployment 
for that period of time. He has not provided any documentation nor any evidence to 
reflect that he has taken steps or has a plan to resolve his delinquent debts.  He held a 
security clearance while in the military. Applicant completed his security clearance 
application in November 2015. (Item 3)  
 
 Applicant’s explanation for his financial difficulties  is his lack of sufficient income 
since military retirement. During his 2017 investigative interview, he stated that he had a 
car repossessed during the last seven years. He also stated that he did not know how to 
budget for his finances. His credit reports indicate that he has had financial problems 
since 2004. (Item 5)  He intends to pay or dispute his debts. (Item 9)) 
 
  Applicant’s current financial status is not known as he provided no information. 
He referred to a hardship, but provided no details. He did not report any financial 
counseling.  He intends to pay the delinquent debts, but he did not have a definite plan. 
He did not respond to the FORM to supplement the record. 
 
      Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
 
3 
 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s finances remain a source of concern. Failure to meet one’s financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.2 Applicant’s 
admissions and the credit reports establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations and that he has an

inability to do so.3 Applicant presented no evidence to mitigate the concerns about his 
plans to resolve the issues by working with a collection company, but he intends to pay 
his debts. He chose not to file bankruptcy. A promise to pay in the future is not enough 
to mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing and were 
not caused by events beyond his control. He has not shown by this record that he has 
acted responsibly. None of the mitigating conditions apply. AG 20(a)- 20(d) 
  
After a review of the record and a consideration of the whole-person factors at 
AG ¶ 2(d), I conclude that Applicant’s financial problems render him unsuitable for  
access to classified information at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the type of financial stability 
necessary to reapply for national security eligibility in the future.  The award of a 
security clearance is not a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the 
factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. While a favorable 
decision is not warranted at this time, he may present persuasive evidence of financial 
rehabilitation and reform in the future.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a-1.f:    Against Applicant 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
