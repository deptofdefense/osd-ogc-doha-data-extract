HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling 
$62,208. She has 13 student loans in established payment plans. She successfully 
disputed three debts, and she paid three debts. She made sufficient progress towards 
resolution of her financial issues. Financial considerations security concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On June 26, 2015, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit (GE) 1. On October 
11, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 
2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006. Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. The SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. HE 2. 
 
                                            
1 On October 27, 2017, Ms. Siegwart advised that she is no longer representing Applicant.

On November 1, 2016, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and she 
requested a hearing. HE 3. On January 4, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed. On July 19, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On August 10, 2017, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the 
hearing for September 18, 2017. HE 1. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 4 exhibits; Applicant offered 14 
exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
Tr. 11-12; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-N. On September 26, 2017, DOHA received 
a copy of the hearing transcript. On November 15, 2017, Applicant provided three 
exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. AE O-Q. The record closed 
on November 20, 2017. Tr. 82. 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2

Financial Considerations 
 
After Applicant’s divorce in 2003, Applicant’s former husband was abusive when it 
came to custody of and visitation with their children. Tr. 46. The state relocated Applicant 
and her children to a different state because of his threats. Tr. 47-51. From 2005 to 2010, 
Applicant and her former spouse were engaged in a bitter, litigious, and expensive legal 
battle over custody and visitation involving their children. Tr. 48-51, 76. Her income for 
several years was limited because of unemployment or underemployment. Tr. 53-55, 78-
79. She has been educated about finances and maintaining a budget. Tr. 57.  
 
The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling $62,208, and the record establishes 
the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off bank debt for $12,358. Applicant’s July 6, 2016 
credit report indicates the debt is a real estate debt, and the creditor initiated foreclosure. 
AE A. The debt was the second mortgage on her rental property. Tr. 62. A tenant rented 
the property for several months, and then it became vacant. Tr. 63-64. Her attempt to sell 
the property was unsuccessful in part because of the decline in real estate values. Tr. 64-
66. Applicant believes the debt was resolved through foreclosure. Tr. 18-21, 65-66. On 
September 13, 2017, Applicant wrote the creditor seeking information about this debt. AE 
A. Applicant wrote the creditor stating that she believed the debt was resolved through 
foreclosure; she had not received any notice of a deficiency; and she wanted information 
about the status of the debt. AE A. The creditor responded, stating that the most recent 
information on the account was on August 1, 2010; the principal balance was zero; and 
the suspense balance was zero. AE A. The creditor did not request any payments; 
however, if the creditor seeks payments, Applicant promised to pay this debt. Tr. 21.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e through 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n allege nine state student-loan debts 
owed to the same creditor that were placed for collection for $12,328, $5,631, $4,007, 
$3,128, $3,034, $3,010, $1,993, $1,880, and $1,310. From September 2016 to July 2017, 
she made $200 monthly payments to the creditor. Tr. 67-69; AE B. On July 26, 2017, 
after an assessment of Applicant’s income, the creditor and Applicant agreed on a $721 
monthly payment plan to address a $45,297 balance owed. Tr. 31-34. On July 27, 2017, 
August 23, 2017, September 22, 2017, and October 23, 2017, Applicant paid $721 to the 
creditor. AE C; AE O. Applicant is paying this debt using automatic payments from her 
bank account. Tr. 32. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.j, and 1.m allege four state student-loan debts 180 days past 
due, which are owed to the same creditor for $9,389, $1,074, $283, and $186. From 
August to December 2016, Applicant made five $200 payments. Tr. 67-69; SOR response 
at 8-9. Applicant established a $582 monthly payment plan, and made $582 payments on 
September 26, 2017, and October 26, 2017. Tr. 34-44; AE P. The current balance owed 
is about $25,000. Tr. 78. Applicant is paying the debt using automatic payments from her

4 
                                         
 
response at 11. On November 30, 2016, the creditor wrote the debt was paid, and the 
balance owed is zero. SOR response at 10. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a telecommunications charged-off debt for $380. Applicant said 
she currently has an account with the same telecommunications creditor, and her account 
is current. SOR response. She filed a dispute with the creditor, and on September 16, 
2017, the creditor responded that Applicant was not responsible for the charges on the 
account. Tr. 29-30; AE F. Because the account appeared to be the result of identity theft, 
Applicant filed a police report with her local police department. Tr. 30; AE I. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.q alleges a debt placed for collection for $578. On September 12, 2017, 
Applicant paid this debt. Tr. 27-28. On September 14, 2017, the creditor wrote 
acknowledging receipt of payment and promising to notify credit-reporting companies that 
the account should be removed from her credit reports. Tr. 27-28; AE G.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges a debt placed for collection for $447.  Applicant did not recognize 
the creditor. SOR response. The creditor has not contacted Applicant. SOR response. 
Applicant was unable to contact the collection agent because the collection agent had

budgeted monthly student loan payments of $1,303 on her PFS. AE Q. Her PFS did not 
include her husband’s income, expenses, or debts.  
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided four character statements from friends and coworkers. AE J-
AE M. The general sense of the statements is that Applicant is diligent, helpful, loyal, 
reliable, competent, honest, and professional. She makes important contributions to 
mission accomplishment. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
 
5 
                                         
 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
7 
                                         
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant’s 
finances were harmed by her divorce, legal expenses in her custody litigation, vacancy 
of her rental property, decline in real estate values, unemployment, and 
underemployment. These circumstances are partially or fully beyond her control. She 
received some financial counseling, and she generated a budget that includes payments 
to the SOR student-loan creditors. 
 
The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling $62,208. She has 13 student loans 
in established payment plans; she successfully disputed 3 debts; and she paid 3 debts.  
 
In ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board 
addressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the 
ability to pay her creditors. The Appeal Board noted “it will be a long time at best before 
she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment 
compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a 
circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given 
his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 
(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment 
plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate that plan.” Id. 
The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because it did not 
“articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the Administrative 
Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should have done under 
the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or 
why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light of his limited 
circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Applicant acted responsibly by paying 3 debts and establishing payment plans for 
13 debts. Although there is limited evidence of record that she established and maintained 
contact with her creditors,5 her financial problem is being resolved and is under control.      
 
                                            
5  “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
9 
                                         
 
 Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions 
to resolve her debts, establishing some good faith.6 Based on Applicant’s credible and 
sincere promise to pay her debts and her track record of paying them, future new 
delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” “[T]here are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” Applicant assures she will conscientiously 
endeavor to maintain her financial responsibility. She has sufficient income to resolve her 
remaining debts. Her efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 40 years old, and a government contractor has employed her as an 
office manager for a government contractor for two years. In 2012, she married her 
                                            
6 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

the Marine Corps Reserve from 1996 to 2000 and in the Army National Guard or Reserve 
from 2005 to 2011. She received honorable discharges from each of her enlistments. In 
2007, Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in health education and promotion.  
 
Applicant provided four character statements from friends and coworkers. The 
consensus of the statements is that Applicant is diligent, helpful, loyal, reliable, 
competent, honest, and professional. She makes important contributions to mission 
accomplishment. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of 
illegal drugs.  
 
Applicant’s financial problems were caused by several circumstances partially or 
fully beyond her control. The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling $62,208. She 
successfully disputed 3 debts; she paid 3 debts; and she has established payment plans 
to address her 13 student-loan debts totaling $70,297. The Appeal Board has addressed 
a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). She understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She took reasonable actions under her particular financial 
circumstances to address her delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment, and she assures she will maintain her financial 
responsibility.7 
                                            
7 Failure to maintain financial responsibility may raise a security concern. The Government has the 
option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. The Government can re-validate 
Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval 
of a clearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The 
Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light 
of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.s:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
