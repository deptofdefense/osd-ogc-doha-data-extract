Decision

CREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied. Applicant failed to present sufficient information to 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 14, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position 
with a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the 
affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated September 1, 2015, detailing security concerns for 
financial considerations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 
(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
  2 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on September 30, 2015. He admitted the 18 
allegations of delinquent debt.1 At the time, Applicant requested that his case be 
decided on the written record. (Case File, Item 2, dated September 30, 2015) Applicant 
was sent a File of Relative Material (FORM) outlining the government’s case.  
 
In September 2016, Applicant requested that his case be decided after a hearing. 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 17, 2016, and the case was 
assigned to me on February 5, 2017. DOD issued a notice of hearing on July 25, 2017, 
for a hearing on August 10, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The 
Government’s four exhibits (GX 1-4), and Applicant’s 27 exhibits (AX A through CC 
were admitted into the record without objection. I left the record open for Applicant to 
submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted five documents, AX DD to AX 
HH, which were admitted into the record without objection. (GX 5, e-mail, dated 
September 18, 2017) I received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 17, 2017. 
The record closed on September 18, 2017, upon my receipt of the additional 
documents.  
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals 
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility 
to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the September 1, 2006 AGs and 
are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have 
evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the 
following findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old. He graduated from high school in 
June 2000, and received his bachelor’s degree in May 2005. He married in April 2013, 
and his wife is expecting their second child. He is a program analyst for a defense 
contractor. He has been eligible for access to classified information since January 2009. 
There are no reports of any security violations. (Tr. 15-16, AX N, College Transcript, AX 
O and AX CC, Bachelor’s Degree Certificate, dated May 2005; AX P. Resume).  
 
Applicant’s recent performance evaluation shows that he was on-target to meet 
all performance objectives. (AX Q) He is highly regarded by his senior manager who 
does not regard him as a security concern. (AX BB, Letter, dated August 3, 3017) A 
Coast Guard officer that Applicant worked with in 2011 to 2013, wrote that Applicant’s 
                                            
1 Applicant, at the hearing, amended his response to the SOR to indicate that he disputed the 
debt at SOR 1.k. (Tr. 17-18) 
 
2 I considered Applicant’s case under both the September 1, 2006 AGs, and the June 8, 2017 
AGs. My decision would be the same under both AGs. 
  3 
 
performance was professional with attention to detail. He was loyal and honest. (AX S, 
Letter of Recommendation, dated July 26, 2017) 
 
Applicant was married on May 11, 2013. Some of his debts were due to the 
wedding. Applicant was unemployed for six months from October 2013 until May 2014. 
He lost his job for performance reasons. He admitted that he used credit cards to make 
purchases he could not afford. (Tr. 29-30) He and his wife sought credit counseling in 
June 2017, and Applicant completed a course that is part of his financial counseling. 
(AX K, Letter, dated June 6, 2017; AX M, Certificate, dated July 30, 2017) Applicant and 
his wife also hired a financial manager to get better discipline in their spending. 
Applicant testified that he and his wife now have more discipline in their spending and 
have a budget. (Tr. 30-33) His latest Personal Financial Statement (PFS) shows he has 
a net monthly salary of $3,830, his wife has a net monthly salary of $5,800, for a 
combined monthly salary of $9,630. The PFS shows that they have $9,368 in monthly 
expense leaving a monthly remainder of $262. (AX M, dated July 25, 2017) At the 
hearing, Applicant stated that his present yearly salary is approximately $89,000, and 
his wife’s present annual salary is $110,000. (Tr.15-16, 21-22)  
 
The SOR alleges, and credit reports (GX 2, dated August 6, 2015; GX 3, dated 
January 16, 2015; GX 4, dated August 16, 2016) confirm the following delinquent debts 
for Applicant: a charged off student loan for $3,368 (SOR 1.a); four charged off credit 
card accounts for different stores to the same bank for $906 (SOR 1.b), $670 (SOR 
1.c), $521 (SOR 1.d), and $522 (SOR 1.e); two store credit card accounts in collection 
for the same collection agency for $976 (SOR 1.f) and $1,055 (SOR 1.g); two store 
credit card accounts for the same bank for $663 (SOR 1.h) and $712 (SOR 1.i); an 
electronics store credit card account in collection for $851 (SOR 1.j); a telephone 
service debt charged off for $100 (SOR 1.k); a department store account charged off for 
$1,257 (SOR 1.l); a store credit card account charged off for $1,072 (SOR 1.m); a 
department store credit account 150 days past due for $325, on a balance of $444 
(SOR 1.n); another credit card account charged off for a different department store for 
$886 (SOR 1.o); a credit account charged off for $1,078 (SOR 1,p); a department store 
account charged off for $1,855 (SOR 1.q); and an account charged off for $615 (SOR 
1.r). The total amount of the delinquent debt is approximately $17,500.  
 
Applicant listed a number of delinquent store accounts, credit card accounts, and 
student loans on his e-QIP. He indicated that he would work with the creditors to pay 
the accounts prior to December 31, 2014. (GX 2, e-QIP, dated May 14, 2014) In his 
response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts and stated he was refocusing his 
finances and was in the process of making payment arrangements with the creditors. 
He noted that the amount of debt was less than 10% of his and his wife’s combined 
incomes. (SOR Response, dated September 29, 2015).  
 
Applicant also acknowledged that he purchased a 2012 used vehicle in February 
2016 for $29,000. He owes in excess of $24,000 on the vehicle and has a monthly 
payment of $508. Nine months later in November 2016, he purchased a 2015 vehicle 
for $22,000. He was able to make a down payment of $2,000 on the 2015 car, leaving a 
  4 
 
$495 monthly payment. Applicant also acknowledged that he has five credit cards 
issued by the same credit union with a balance of approximately $26,593. He used the 
cards for general everyday expenses and house supplies like gas and groceries. His 
minimum monthly payments on these cards is approximately $550. These cards are at 
the credit limit but are not delinquent. Applicant lists $2,300 in miscellaneous monthly 
expenses which includes his wife’s student loan payments of $200 monthly, and $1,600 
monthly tithing to their church. Applicant and his wife pay $1,600 monthly in day care 
expenses. This amount will rise when his wife gives birth to their second child. 
Applicant’s student loan payments are deferred until he completes his master’s degree 
started in August 2014. He anticipates receiving his degree in May 2019. Applicant also 
anticipates that the family has $300 to $400 a month in normal household expenses. 
(Tr. 39-45; AX M. PFS, dated , July 25, 2017) 
 
Applicant presented information on payments made on his debts. The creditor for 
the student loan debt at SOR 1.a cancelled the debt and issued Applicant an Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C. (AX HH, 1099-C, dated June 12, 2015)

clothing for both of them. Applicant has a payment plan for the store credit card debt at 
SOR 1.b opened on April 1, 2013. He made a payment of $166 on July 28, 2017. His

Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for security eligibility 
will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have drawn 
  6 
 
only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about a person’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. (AG ¶ 18) The 
financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might 
knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s responsibility, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security 
clearance adjudications are based on an evaluation of an individual’s reliability and 
trustworthiness. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or careless in his or her obligations to protect classified information. 
Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how 
a person may behave in other aspects of life. 
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet his financial obligations. 
Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent 
with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her 
finances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  
 
Credit reports and Applicant’s admissions reveal that he has extensive 
delinquent credit card debt. The record shows that Applicant used credit cards to 
purchase items and live beyond his means. Applicant opened four store credit card 
accounts within 13 days in April 2013. He purchased two cars in 2015 and has car loan 
  7 
 
payments of over $1,000 monthly. He has other monthly expenses in excess of $3,200, 
and his credit card balance totals over $25,000. He did not make payments on his credit 
debt until just prior to the hearing in August 2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise 
security concerns under Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts,  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payment or non-payments, or other 
negative financial indicators.  
 
The information raises issues about Applicant’s self-control, judgment, and 
willingness and ability to meet his financial obligations. Once the Government has 
established an adverse financial issue, the Applicant has the responsibility to refute or 
mitigate the issue. 
  
I considered the following Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions under 
AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from 
a legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling 
service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
  8 
 
 
The mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. The debts are 
normal consumer, student loan, and credit card debts. The items Applicant purchased 
were not necessities but items that he wanted. Applicant could easily use credit cards 
again to purchase unnecessary items. Applicant had a six-month period of 
unemployment caused by his own poor performance. Applicant did not provide sufficient 
information to explain how his unemployment led to the delinquent debts. He provided 
information concerning financial counseling. 
 
Applicant resolved some of the debts, and recently made payments on other 
debts. The fact that he received debt cancellations and IRS forms 1099-C does not 
indicate that he paid the debts. There are indications that Applicant paid two of the 
debts in full.  
 
Applicant knew when he submitted his e-QIP in May 2014 that he had debts that 
were of security concern. He indicated then that he would work to resolve the debts. He 
stated again in September 2015, when he responded to the SOR, that he would work to 
resolve the delinquent debts. In September 2016, he was reminded of the debts when 
he received the FORM. However, Applicant did not start to make small token payments 
on his debts until June 2017, just before the hearing was being scheduled on July 25, 
2017. This indicates that Applicant was making payments on the debts in anticipation of 
gaining favorable evidence for the hearing.  
 
Applicant and his wife are gainfully employed with significant salaries. They 
share household expenses. But Applicant’s payments on his debts are too little too late. 
Accordingly, he has not established a good-faith effort to pay his debts. There is no 
clear evidence that his debt problems have been resolved, and his finances are under 
control. Overall, he has not provided evidence or proof that he acted with reason and 
responsibility towards his finances. His living beyond his means, and his late and limited 
efforts to resolve his financial problems are a strong indication that he may not protect 
and safeguard classified information. In sum, Applicant did not present sufficient 
information to mitigate financial security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Analysis 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all 
relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
  9 
 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s 
approximately ten years of service to DOD contractor, and his almost ten years of 
eligibility for access to classified information without a security incident.  
 
Applicant did not present sufficient information to establish that he acted 
reasonably and responsibly towards his finances under the circumstances. Applicant did 
not establish a record of paying his debts and acting in a financially responsible manner. 
He did not establish that he acted with reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and an 
adherence to duty and obligation towards his financial obligations. Applicant has not 
met his burden to establish his good-faith efforts to resolve his remaining debts.  
 
Applicant’s lack of reasonable and responsible actions towards his finances is an 
indication that he will not protect and safeguard classified information. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, trustworthiness, and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all 
these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns arising 
under the financial considerations guideline. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.r  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
