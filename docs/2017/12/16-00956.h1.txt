GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 5, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on September 27, 2016, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 14, 
2017. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
on August 25, 2017, scheduling the hearing for September 22, 2017. Since Applicant 
 
2 
 
did not receive the notice, DOHA issued an amended notice on September 22, 2017, 
rescheduling the hearing for November 3, 2017. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. 
 
The Government amended the SOR, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive, to 
clarify the allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, and provided notice to Applicant on 
September 19, 2017. At hearing and without objection from Applicant, the Government 
further amended the SOR to conform ¶ 1.c to the evidence.1 The Government’s 
demonstrative exhibit was appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection.2 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted in 
evidence without objection.                                                                                                                      
 
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until December 1, 2017, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
She timely provided additional evidence, which I marked collectively as Applicant’s 
Exhibit (AE) B. I appended to the record as HEs II and III the Government’s amendment 
to the SOR and the Government’s email indicating no objection to AE B, and admitted 
AE B into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 13, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g., 1.h, and 1.l, 
and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k.3  
 
 Applicant is 49 years old. She obtained her high-school diploma in 1994 and her 
bachelor’s degree in 1998. She has worked as a developer for her current defense 
contractor since 1999, and as of the hearing, was a software engineer. She has held a 
DOD security clearance since 1999.4 
 
 Applicant is unmarried. She has an adult son who was in college, working, and 
recently moved out of her home. He made minor contributions to the household when 
he lived with Applicant.5 
 
 The SOR alleges three judgments totaling $13,842 filed against Applicant in 
2012, 2014, and 2015; a $14,475 delinquent mortgage account; a $35,080 delinquent 
student loan account; six delinquent consumer debts totaling $47,190; and that her 
wages were garnished in March 2013 for $2,684. The allegations are established by

Applicant’s admissions and credit reports from January 2015, February 2016, and 
November 2016. Applicant also listed and discussed her delinquent debts in her 
November 2014 security clearance application and during her July 2015 interview.6  
 
Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to the loss of her then-boyfriend’s 
income, after he moved out of her home, shortly after she purchased it in 2006. She 
acknowledged during her July 2015 interview that she also made bad decisions by 
lending money to family members and living outside her means. She believed that some 
of the debts reported on her credit reports belonged to another individual with the same 
name.7  
 
Since 2006, Applicant attempted to address her debts by working overtime. She 
also supplemented her annual income of $90,000 by bartending for two years from 
2013 to 2014, during which time she averaged around $200 weekly. She was unable to 
continue bartending long term and maintain her full-time job. She also contacted her 
creditors to try to work out payment arrangements to resolve her debts.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a is for a $14,475 delinquent mortgage account for Applicant’s home; 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g are for Applicant’s homeowner’s dues; and the 
garnishment of her wages in SOR ¶ 1.l for $2,684, in March 2013, was tied to her 
delinquent homeowner’s dues. She refinanced her mortgage between 2015 and 2016 to 
$1,100 monthly. She was current on her mortgage for at least one year as of the 
hearing date.9  
 
 When Applicant purchased her home, she did not understand that her $900 
monthly mortgage was separate from her $200 monthly homeowner’s dues. She paid 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. Her wages were garnished to resolve the judgments in SOR ¶¶ 1.e 
and 1.g; these judgments are not reported on her most recent credit reports from 
November 2017. In paying SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, as well as SOR ¶ 1.h as 
discussed below, she became delinquent on her homeowner’s dues for 2017 by 
approximately $1,400. As of the hearing, she was working on an arrangement with the 
homeowner’s association to resolve her arrears and pay her monthly dues.10  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is a $20,776 charge-off for a car Applicant leased. A February 2013 
letter from the leasing company reflects that Applicant’s lease payments were 
completed and the car was returned. Because she had not received any further 
correspondence from the leasing company concerning an outstanding balance, she 
believed this debt was erroneously reported as delinquent on her credit reports. Despite 
the leasing company’s 2013 letter, Applicant’s November 2017 credit reports continue to

report this charge-off. The credit reports also reflect that Applicant was paying this debt 
at $700 monthly.11 
 
 Applicant was unaware of SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.i. As of the hearing date, she had not 
begun to investigate these debts, but she intended to. She believed that SOR ¶ 1.i may 
have potentially fallen off her recent credit reports because of the work done on her 
behalf by the company from which she sought financial counseling in 2012. Both of 
these debts were not reported on her November 2017 credit reports.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h is for a $35,080 student loan in collection status. Applicant obtained 
the student loan to finance her college education. She indicated during her July 2015 
interview that she had an arrangement with the student loan company to automatically 
debit $500 from her bank account monthly. She believed that when the automatic 
deductions stopped, her student loan was paid. As of her hearing, her wages were 
being garnished $1,000 monthly by the student loan company, and she believed that 
the remaining balance of her student loan was $12,000.13  
 
 In her post-hearing submission, Applicant indicated that she spoke with the 
student loan company, who informed her that there was a discrepancy between her 
student loan and the agency handling it; she was awaiting the student loan company’s 
resolution of that discrepancy; and the balance of her student loan was $45,041. Her 
November 2017 credit reports reflect that she has two student loans totaling $55,033, 
for which she carried a delinquent balance totaling $5,155.14 
 
 Applicant testified that while she was aware SOR ¶ 1.j was reported on her credit 
reports, she was unaware of the details surrounding it. She attempted to research the 
debt through the company from which she sought financial counseling in 2012, but was 
unable to obtain any information. This debt was not reported on her November 2017 
credit reports.15 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k is a delinquent medical debt for $115. This debt is unpaid, and 
Applicant is unaware of the details surrounding it. She attempted to research the debt 
through the company from which she sought financial counseling in 2012, but was 
unable to obtain any information. This debt was not reported on her November 2017 
credit reports.16

 Applicant sought financial counseling in 2012, and the company assisted her with 
removing debts from her credit report that were not hers. She does not have any other 
delinquent debts, and she is current on her payments for the used car that she 
purchased in 2015. She currently earns $115,000 annually, her monthly net pay is 
$4,000, her monthly expenses are around $2,600, and her monthly net remainder varies 
from $200 to $500 depending on her overtime.17 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.

Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable and has a history of not paying her debts. The evidence is 
sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
 
7 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Conditions beyond her control largely contributed to Applicant’s financial 
problems. However, Applicant acknowledged that she also made bad decisions by 
lending money to family members and living outside her means.   
 
 Since her financial problems started in 2006, Applicant received financial 
counseling and has made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. She 
resolved SOR ¶ 1.a by refinancing her mortgage. She resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d., 1.e, 
and 1.g, though she did so, in part, through the garnishment of her wages in SOR ¶ 1.l. 
While she was $1,400 in arrears on her homeowner’s dues for 2017, she was working 
on an arrangement with the homeowner’s association to resolve it. She was in the 
process of resolving SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.h, and as of her November 2017 credit reports, 
she made significant progress in resolving SOR ¶ 1.h, as the outstanding delinquent 
balance was $5,155.  
 
 Though SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k were not reported on her most recent credit 
reports, Applicant credibly testified that she was unaware of them, and she intended to 
research them further. 
 
  A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she 
need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
While she has unresolved debts remaining, she has demonstrated a good-faith effort 
and has the means to continue to resolve them. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) 
are applicable.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
8 
 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has made efforts to resolve 
her debts. While she has unresolved debts remaining, she credibly testified at hearing 
and there is sufficient evidence to show that she is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.l:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
