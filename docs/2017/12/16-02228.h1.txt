MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
On November 25, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging that her familial connections and other ties to 
Turkey raised a security concern under the foreign influence guideline. Applicant 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing to establish her eligibility for continued 
access to classified information. 
 
 On December 7, 2017, I convened a hearing. After the record closed, I informed 
the parties that the case appeared appropriate for summary disposition in Applicant’s 
favor. Department Counsel did not object. (Exhibit I.) The transcript of the hearing was 
received on December 18, 2017. 
 
 Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by her foreign connections and 
contacts. She and her husband were born in Turkey. They immigrated to the United 
States over 25 years ago, and both have held security clearances for over 20 years. 
Applicant reported and candidly discussed her foreign connections, contacts, and travel 
during the course of multiple security clearance reviews over the years. She recently 
turned down a lucrative job offer to relocate to Europe, where she would be closer to 
her country of birth, because she does not want to live so far away from her children

and grandchildren – all of whom live in the United States. Applicant and her husband’s 
total net worth, which includes multiple U.S. properties and U.S. investment accounts, 
exceeds five million dollars. Applicant’s substantial ties to the United States and 
favorable security record show that she can continue to be entrusted to place the 
security interests of the United States over her relatively weak foreign connections.1  
 
In evaluating the security concern at issue, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice 
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept and considered the 
country at issue. After considering the entire record evidence, I conclude that Applicant 
met her burden of proof and persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to extend Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
