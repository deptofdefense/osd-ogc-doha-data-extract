KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised 
by his problematic financial history and his alcohol consumption. Accordingly, this case is 
decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on March 9, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On April 20, 2017, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
2 
 
the action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations 
and Guideline G for alcohol consumption. Applicant answered the SOR on May 15, 2017, 
and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On July 12, 2017 Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant July 14, 2017. He was given 30 days to file 
objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s 
evidence. Applicant received the FORM on July 21, 2017.3 Applicant did not respond to 
the FORM. The case was assigned to me on November 27, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were nine items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.4 GE 1 and GE 3 through 7 are admitted into 
evidence without objection. GE 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing 
Applicant’s interviews in August 2016 and November 2016. The ROI is not authenticated, 
as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s written brief includes 
a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to 
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. Nevertheless, I am not 
persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond to the FORM, which response is 
optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement. 
The record does not demonstrate that Applicant understood the concepts of 
authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not demonstrate that he understood 
the implications of waiving an objection to the admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 
2 is inadmissible, and I have not considered it.    
 
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My decision and 
formal findings under the revised Guideline F and Guideline G would not be different under the 2006 
Guidelines.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 14, 2017, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated July 21, 2017. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 
days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR, and second item is Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and the 
Answer are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 3 through 9 are marked as 
Exhibits 1 through 7.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 49 years old, and married with two children. He holds a master’s 
degree, and from September 1986 until his honorable discharge in October 1994, he 
served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force. Since October 2004, he has worked for a 
defense contractor.6 
 
Under Guideline F, SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $161,318, of 
which about $63,790 is for student loans. Applicant denied three of the debts and admits 
the remaining six.7 In his security clearance application, he reported that he incurred 
about $93,000 in delinquent credit card debt due to his mother’s medical expenses and 
that he was in the process of filing for bankruptcy. Applicant did not detail when he 
shouldered his mother’s medical expenses.8 Notwithstanding Applicant’s denials, all SOR 
debts are supported by the record.9 His delinquencies go back to about mid-2014.10  
 
Regarding SOR ¶ 1.a (which he denied), Applicant provided documentation from 
a collection agency showing a payment of $486 in April 2017, leaving an outstanding 
balance of $133,315. Applicant added a handwritten note on that document saying, “I 
have made the past 4 payments Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., 2017.”  He did not submit any 
documentation memorializing those four payments.  
 
Applicant stated that he will resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.f. and 1.i  
through settlement offers or the sale of his home. He provided documentation showing 
the current value of his home ($343,482). 
 
Applicant denied the admitted debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g and stated that he recently 
paid $2,400 toward it. Applicant provided documentation of that payment in March 2017 
and an agreement to make 12 additional payments in satisfaction of the debt. He provided 
no documentation showing further payments under that agreement. He also denied the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.h, but stated in his answer that he was unaware of it and will resolve it 
immediately. Applicant did not provide any documentation that he has resolved that debt.  
 
Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was twice arrested for driving 
while intoxicated (DWI), in January 2010 and in April 2014.11 Applicant admitted that he 
was arrested for DWI in both instances but notes that he was charged only with DWI – 2d

offense in 2014 and not with an open container, as the SOR alleges.12 Based on the 
supporting evidence, Applicant is correct.13  
 
The April 2014 arrest was Applicant’s second DWI. In both instances, he was 
stopped for speeding, failed a field sobriety test, and was subsequently convicted of 
DUI.14 His 2014 conviction resulted in a $4,000 fine, plus court costs.15 In his answer, 
Applicant stated that he accepted his punishment, paid the fine, completed community 
service, attended awareness classes, and AA meetings.16 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.17 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”18 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.19 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.21 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.22 An

applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.23 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.24 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.25 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26 
 
     Discussion 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
  Under Guideline F for financial considerations,27 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information….28 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying  
conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
 AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.

28 AG ¶ 18.

   In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG 20 ¶(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and,  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial 
history going back to about 2014. Security concerns are raised under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
(c).  The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Although Applicant’s financial woes appear to date back to about 2014, they persist 
to this day. Moreover, his delinquencies are not infrequent.  AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
Looking at the record generously in Applicant’s favor, I could find that some of his 
delinquencies resulted from his mother’s illness, a circumstance largely beyond his 
control.29 That, however, does not end the analysis. Applicant must have acted 
responsibly in confronting that circumstance. There is nothing in the record showing that 
Applicant acted responsibly in addressing the debts resulting from his mother’s illness. 
Therefore, AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. Similarly, there is nothing in the record showing 
that Applicant received or is receiving financial counseling. Therefore, AG ¶ 20(c) does 
not apply.  
 
For SOR ¶ 1.a (a student loan), Applicant documented a one-time payment of $486 
in April of 2017. He submitted no documents showing any further payments. Similarly, for  
SOR ¶ 1.g, he provided a document showing a one-time payment of $2,400 but no 
documents of any further payments. The Board has previously noted that it is reasonable 
for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of 
                                                          
29 In fact, the record does not provide any basis for identifying which SOR debts were related to his mother’s 
illness. 
7 
 
individual debts.30 The Board also has held that applicants must show a track record of 
debt repayments.31  Thus, AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply to SOR ¶¶ 1.a or g.  
 
For the remaining SOR debts, Applicant in his answer stated his intent to resolve 
them in the future by settlement offers or by selling his house. The Board has long held, 
however, that “promises to pay off debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record 
of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible 
manner.”32 Thus, Applicant has not mitigated the remaining SOR debts.  
 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
AG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. 
AG ¶ 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other 
incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with 
alcohol use disorder; and  
 
 (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol 
use disorder. 
 
 Applicant’s DWIs in 2010 and 2014 raise a security concern under AG ¶ 22(a). 
 
I have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption 
under AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
judgment;  
                                                          
30 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). 
 
31 ISCR Case No. 08-09704 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2010). 
 
32 ISCR Case No. 14-04-04565 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-03069 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 
30, 2015).

(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol 
use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has 
established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance 
with treatment recommendations; and  
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along 
with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established 
pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment 
recommendations. 
 
In the absence of the 2014 DWI, the 2010 DWI standing alone likely would be 
mitigated under AG ¶ 23(a) due to the passage of time.  The 2014 DWI, however, just 
over three years ago, elevates the security concern to the present day such that AG ¶ 
23(a) does not apply. Although it would be an overstatement to conclude that those two 
DWIs create a pattern, Applicant needs to show a lengthier period of sobriety and the 
absence of any alcohol-related incidents for AG ¶¶ 23(b) and (d) to apply.  
 
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.33 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:                   Against Applicant 
  
  Paragraph 2, Guideline G              Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:     Against Applicant 
   
   
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
                                                          
33 AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).

 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
