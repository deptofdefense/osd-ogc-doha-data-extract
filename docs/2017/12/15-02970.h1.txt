MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 8, 2014. 
On February 23, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006 (2006 AG). 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on March 25, 2016, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The Government was ready to proceed on February 21, 2017, 
and the case was assigned to me on June 13, 2017. On July 10, 2017, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for August 11, 2017. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted into evidence, without objection. The letter that 
the Government sent to Applicant was appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE I) 
and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted into evidence, without 
 
2 
 
objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open until September 11, 2017. 
Applicant timely provided additional documents that were admitted into evidence as AE 
C through M, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 18, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG (2017 AG).1 Accordingly, I have 
applied the 2017 AG.2 However, I have also considered the 2006 AG, because they 
were in effect on the date the SOR was issued. I conclude that my decision would have 
been the same under either version. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 53, has been married for 10 years. He has one child, age seven. 
Since obtaining a high school diploma and vocational certificate in 1982, he has taken 
some college courses. Applicant honorably served in the Navy from 1984 through 1991 
and 1999 through 2002, and in the Army National Guard from 1992 through 1993 and 
2003 through 2006. As a civilian, he has been employed primarily by defense 
contractors since 2008; and with his current employer since 2016. He was unemployed 
for an eight month period between 2009 and 2010 due to unforeseen circumstances.4 
Applicant seeks to regain the security clearance that he has held for approximately ten 
years.5 
 
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $14,555 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, and 
1.g), four accounts charged-off in unspecified amounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e), and 
failure to file, as required, federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 
through 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the 
SOR allegations except for SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.g, which are established by credit 
reports submitted by each party.6  
 
For each of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e, credit reports show a 
$0 balance. In the 2014 and 2016 credit reports, the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is noted 
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD 4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD 4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD 4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD 4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD 4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information. (SEAD 4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards).

Applicant’s SOR answer, SCA (GE 1), and the summary of his subject interview (GE 7).

as “paid” and “closed by consumer.” In his SCA, Applicant reported approximate 
balances of $134 and $1,433 for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, respectively, 
and confirmed same during his security clearance interview. He did not report in his 
SCA the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and denied knowledge of it during his interview. In 
the 2014 credit report, the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is noted as “in dispute,” 
“transferred” and in “collection” status with a high credit of $319. The 2015 credit report 
does not reflect that dispute, but shows the same high credit and that it was charged off 
and then either transferred or sold. SOR ¶ 1.e is not shown on the 2016 credit report.7 
 
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f was resolved by involuntary garnishment, 8 and the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g are unresolved. Applicant attributes his 
financial indebtedness to his period of unemployment between 2009 and 2010 after the 
job that he was promised fell through at the last minute. At that time, he immediately 
communicated his circumstances to his creditors, to no avail. He depleted savings of 
approximately $10,000 in an attempt to keep current with his bills, but eventually fell 
behind. In approximately 2011, after he became gainfully employed and had sufficient 
funds to do so, he reinitiated efforts to resolve his debts, but by then, they had been 
transferred to collection agencies with whom Applicant chose not to negotiate. During 
his September 2014 security clearance interview, Applicant described a plan to resolve 
his debts with the assistance of a debt consolidation company. At the hearing, Applicant 
acknowledged that he had not followed through with that plan despite having been in 
contact with at least one firm to assist him. Applicant did not assert nor did the record 
reveal any reasonable bases to dispute any of his unresolved debts.9 
 
While he and his wife file joint tax returns, Applicant accepted full responsibility 
for their failure to timely file them for tax years 2010 through 2012, due to him losing 
paperwork and being exhausted from his workload and commute. Applicant filed those 
delinquent tax returns in 2016. He owed the IRS for unpaid taxes in an unspecified 
amount from tax years 2010 through 2012, the current balance of which is 
approximately $1,500. Applicant made seven payments to the IRS for tax year 2011, 
between October 2016 and June 2017, in the total approximate amount of $1,270. 
Applicant’s unpaid 2010 and 2012 taxes were resolved either through his direct 
payment or the withholding of his tax refunds. He understood then and now that he is 
obligated to timely file his tax returns, which he has done for tax years 2013 through the 
present.10

Applicant nets a salary of approximately $4,000 per month.11 He estimated that 
he has a surplus of approximately $200 or $300 per month after paying his expenses.12 
He has not had any financial counseling.13  
 
Applicant has worked in combat zones four times as a defense contractor.14 His 
employer opined that Applicant is honest and trustworthy, and praised his character and 
work performance.15 A friend of 30 years described Applicant as a true patriot with 
“unimpeachable” character, and averred that he is a man of integrity and good 
character.16 A colleague of over four years commended the efficient, detail-oriented, 
and extremely competent and organized manner in which Applicant accomplishes 
tasks. He lauded Applicant’s value and contributions to their company and to the 
survival and safety of troops serving in hazardous battlefield conditions.17 Several other 
colleagues and friends echoed similar positive comments.18 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”19 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”20 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”21 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An

administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”22 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.23 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”24 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.25 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.26 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.27 
   
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”28 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”29

Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income returns and his 
financial indebtedness establish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG 
¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial 
obligations); and AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required).  
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 Applicant has mitigated the concern regarding his failure to timely file tax returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. He filed the tax returns before the SOR was issued, 
established a meaningful track record of repaying his tax debt to the IRS, and timely 
filed his tax returns since tax year 2013. I conclude that this issue is not likely to recur. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), (b), (d) and (g) are established. 
 
 Applicant did not, however, meet his burden to mitigate the concern regarding his 
financial indebtedness. I credit Applicant with resolving the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f via 
wage garnishment. I also find that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has been resolved. 
While the Government met its burden to prove that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was 
charged-off, it did not establish any associated liability. The record does not otherwise 
reveal that Applicant remains monetarily obligated to the creditor. I considered the fact 
that the account was among those charged-off, and I find SOR ¶ 1.e in favor of 
Applicant. 
 
 The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g, totaling approximately 
$14,140, remain unresolved.30 While his period of unemployment between 2009 and 
2010 was a circumstance largely beyond his control, since then, he has not acted 
responsibly to address these debts. I credit his earlier efforts to resolve them with the 
original creditors. However, in the years following his gainful employment, Applicant 
chose not to negotiate with the collection agencies to whom they were transferred, and 
otherwise failed to demonstrate any progress in addressing them (including after the 
month-long period during which the record remained open after the hearing). AG ¶¶ 
20(a), (b), and (d) are not established.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
                                                          
30 Despite the fact that the SOR did not allege amounts for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, I 
based my finding on Applicant’s admissions as to the approximate amounts: $134 and $1,433, 
respectively. I considered that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. could be a duplicate of one or more of the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.e given that the original creditors are the same. However, 
Applicant did not meet his burden to prove such, nor was it otherwise established by the record. 
 
8 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Applicant has served the 
military honorably on active duty and as a civilian contractor. He was candid and sincere 
at the hearing, and is highly regarded by his colleagues and friends for his 
trustworthiness and good character. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to 
timely file his tax returns, but not his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has 
not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.c – 1.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.e – 1.f:  For Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.h – 1.i:   For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is denied.
