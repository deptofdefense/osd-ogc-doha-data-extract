GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 4, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on December 9, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 6, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 9, 
2017, scheduling the hearing for August 1, 2017. On July 11, 2017, with no objection 
from the Government, DOHA issued a notice of cancellation due to Applicant’s 
 
2 
 
unavailability. On July 21, 2017, DOHA issued a notice of hearing rescheduling the 
hearing for September 11, 2017. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. 
 
At the hearing, Applicant requested another continuance. He indicated he was 
not ready to proceed because he had been deployed by his employer to another state 
to assist with relief efforts, and he left the documents he intended to present at the 
hearing at that location. The Government objected to Applicant’s request. With the 
understanding that I would leave the record open for Applicant to provide his 
documentation, I determined that Applicant did not show good cause in accordance with 
E3.1.8 of the Directive and denied Applicant’s second request for a continuance.1   
 
The Government’s discovery letter and exhibit list were appended to the record 
as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1-2, respectively. Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, and 5 to 13 
were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant objected to GEs 3 and 4. I 
overruled his objections and admitted GEs 3 and 4 in evidence.2 Applicant testified.                             
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until September 25, 2017, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
At his request and with no objection from the Government, I subsequently granted 
Applicant an extension until October 25, 2017. He timely provided additional evidence, 
which I marked collectively as Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted into evidence 
without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 19, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e and 1.g. to 1.o, and 
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.p.3  
 
 Applicant is 55 years old. He received his high-school diploma in 1981, and he 
attended college in 2002 but did not earn a degree. He completed security training in 
2007 and 2008, and he obtained a master’s certificate in information systems in 2015. 
He served honorably in the U.S. military from February 1981 until he retired in February 
2003. He has worked for federal contractors since at least September 2006. He was 
first granted a security clearance at the age of 19. As of April 2017, he was separated 
from his wife. He has three adult children, two of whom are in college.4  
 
 The SOR alleges Applicant’s failure to timely file federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2013 and 2014, as required; an April 2009 federal tax lien of 
$28,707; delinquent federal taxes totaling $33,213 for tax years 2005, 2009, and 2010; 
delinquent state taxes of $4,000 for tax year 2012; and nine delinquent consumer

accounts totaling $53,899. The allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions 
and the credit reports. Applicant also discussed his failure to timely file federal and state 
tax returns, his delinquent taxes, and his delinquent debts in his July 2016 response to 
interrogatories.5  
 
Applicant attributed his 2005 delinquent taxes to his limited understanding of how 
to handle his taxes after he retired from the military and began earning more money. 
Though he did not seek financial counseling, he followed the advice of his taxperson, 
increased his withholdings, and claimed zero exemptions. He attributed his 2009 and 
2010 delinquent taxes to the harsher burden he faced as a result of filing his tax returns 
separately from his wife.6 
 
 Applicant attributed his failure to timely file 2013 and 2014 federal and state tax 
returns to his June 2013 chapter 13 bankruptcy. During a difficult period in their 
marriage, when Applicant and his wife could not afford their mortgage payments, they 
acted on their attorney’s advice and filed bankruptcy. When Applicant learned of the 
possible negative implications for his security clearance, they voluntarily dismissed the 
bankruptcy in April 2014. He attributed his failure to timely file his 2015 and 2016 tax 
returns to his wife’s decision to file separately.7  
 
Applicant’s delinquent mortgage culminated in the loss of his home to foreclosure 
in around 2013 to 2014. He attributed his mortgage delinquency to the creditor losing 
one of his payments, his unsuccessful attempt to modify his mortgage, and the failing 
economy that caused him to become underwater.8 
 
Applicant also encountered financial troubles when he and his wife separated in 
2001, and again in 2005 or 2006. In addition, he has contributed $500 monthly to his 
mother since his father’s passing in 2006, and $300 monthly to his father-in-law since 
his mother-in-law’s passing in 2009. He was also unemployed for seven months, and 
his wife for three to four months, in 2010. He stated that he was also a victim of the 
Office of Personnel Management hacking. Finally, he acknowledged that he incurred 
some of his debts by indulging his children.9   
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2005, 2009, 
and 2010 totaling $33,213, and SOR ¶ 1.g is a $28,707 federal tax lien filed against 
Applicant in April 2009. Applicant testified that he made payments towards his 
outstanding federal taxes prior to and through his 2013 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He 
initially testified that he had not made any payments towards his outstanding federal

taxes since the voluntary dismissal of his bankruptcy in 2014, but he then testified that 
he had. He also testified that his tax refunds have been applied to his outstanding 
federal taxes, and he has worked with a tax relief company since early 2017 to reach a 
payment arrangement with the IRS to resolve his outstanding balance. He provided 
documentation to show that $500 of his military pay was allotted for the IRS in 
December 2008 and January 2009.10 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e are Applicant’s failure to timely file federal and state income 
tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014, as required. Applicant testified that though he 
was late in filing them, he did so in 2017 with the help of the tax relief company; he also 
testified that he filed his 2012 and 2015 federal income tax returns. Though he had not 
filed his 2016 federal income tax returns, he stated that the IRS gave him an extension 
to file them by October 2017. However, he testified that he had not filed his 2015 and 
2016 state income tax returns. He believed he did not owe the IRS for tax years 2012, 
2013, 2014, and 2015; rather, he believed he received refunds, which the IRS applied to 
his outstanding taxes as previously discussed. He testified that he did not owe the state 
for tax years 2013 and 2014, and he did not believe he had any outstanding state taxes. 
He stated he would continue working with the tax relief company to file his outstanding 
returns.11  
 
 Applicant provided copies of his joint 2013 and 2014 federal and state income tax 
returns, completed and signed by him and his wife in March 2017. The tax returns 
reflected that Applicant and his wife claimed as deductions for gifts to charity $35,496 in 
2013, and $51,498 in 2014. The returns did not reflect that they had been filed. 
Applicant also provided IRS tax account transcripts from July 2016 for tax periods 2004 
through 2013. The transcripts reflected that Applicant had not filed his 2013 federal 
income tax return. The transcripts also reflected that he had an $11,098 balance for tax 
year 2005, a $4,178 balance for tax year 2009, a $17,936 balance for tax year 2010, 
and a $13,623 balance for tax year 2012. They also reflected that he had a zero 
balance for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2011.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f is $4,000 in delinquent state taxes for tax year 2012. Applicant testified 
that these taxes were resolved in mid-2017, through the application of a federal tax 
refund. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim.13 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, and 1.n are debts to the same federal credit union, for a $7,502 
charge-off, a $6,424 charge-off, and a debt of $14,916 placed in collection, respectively. 
Applicant testified that he believed he paid SOR ¶ 1.h, and was resolving SOR ¶¶ 1.i 
and 1.n through payment arrangements. He provided documentation from the federal 
credit union from October 2017, which reflected that it accepted a settlement amount of

$12,000 for SOR ¶ 1.n, to be paid in 12 monthly installment payments of $1,000, with 
the final payment due no later than November 2018. The documentation also reflected 
that the creditor accepted a settlement amount of $6,078 for another account, to be paid 
in 12 monthly installment payments of $506, with the final payment due no later than 
November 2018; the record is unclear as to whether this latter settlement applies to 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h or 1.i.14 
 
 Applicant testified that he had to further research SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.l, and 1.p. He did 
not understand how he was responsible for SOR ¶ 1.j, though he acknowledged that it 
was a credit card he opened for one of his daughters. He intended to resolve it since 
she had not done so after he spoke to her about it. He was disputing SOR ¶ 1.l, as he 
did not believe he owed it. He contacted the creditor after he received the SOR, but he 
was unable to obtain information about it. He believed SOR ¶ 1.p was for a parking 
ticket, but he was unsure how it was incurred. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant 
stated that he was unable to obtain information about SOR ¶ 1.j since it belonged to his 
daughter, and he requested that the creditor remove it from his credit report. He also 
requested that the creditors remove SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.p from his credit report.15 
 
 The Government withdrew SOR ¶ 1.k, as Applicant is only an authorized user on 
this account.16 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m is for a credit card opened by Applicant’s wife, for which he cosigned. 
He testified that he would resolve it with a payment arrangement from his military 
retirement pay. In his post-hearing submission, he stated that he requested the creditor 
remove this debt from his credit report.17 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o is one of two mortgage accounts for the home Applicant purchased in 
October 2006 that was foreclosed in 2013. Applicant testified that he received an IRS 
form 1099-C from the creditor, which he filed with his 2013 or 2014 tax returns. He did 
not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. The copies of his joint 2013 and 
2014 federal and state income tax returns that Applicant provided did not contain an 
IRS form 1099-C.18 
 
 In November 2001, Applicant was granted a conditional security clearance by the 
Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility due to financial concerns. He was 
cautioned that the future receipt of derogatory information would be cause for 
immediate reconsideration. In around 2010, he had a DOHA security clearance hearing 
due to financial concerns; that proceeding ended favorably for him and he was granted

a security clearance. He denied that another federal government agency denied him 
employment due to credit issues.19  
 
 While not alleged in the SOR, Applicant admitted to gambling. He denied, 
however, the gambling transactions as documented in FINCEN reports provided by the 
Government. He testified that he gambled six to seven times in 2017, $100 on each 
occasion, and at most $900 on one occasion. He stated that he has never taken out 
loans to gamble. He also stated that his separations from his wife were unrelated to his 
gambling.20   
 
 As part of his chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant testified that he received financial 
counseling between 2013 and 2014. His wife managed the household expenses, 
though he started to take control of his finances in light of their recent separation. He 
testified that he has a budget; his monthly net income from his job is $8,800, and he 
also receives $1,600 monthly in military disability and retirement pay. He was unable to 
testify as to his wife’s income. As of the hearing, his rental payments were $2,500 
monthly. He contributed $400 to $500 monthly to his two children’s college expenses. 
He was also responsible for the expenses related to a car he purchased for his 
youngest child. Though his middle child’s car is registered in his name, it was fully paid 
for by his brother, and his child pays the insurance costs. He believed his monthly net 
was a couple thousand dollars, and he had $1,500 in savings. He testified he did not 
have any other delinquent debts. He also testified that he loves serving his country.21  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

21 Tr. at 31-33, 54-56, 61-63, 69-73, 77, 80.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 
8 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant was unable or unwilling to pay his debts, to include his delinquent 
federal and state taxes. He also failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax 
years 2013 and 2014, as required. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant’s SOR debts are unresolved. He did not provide corroborating 
documentation to show that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts, 
to include his taxes. In addition, he did not demonstrate that he filed his 2013 and 2014 
 
9 
 
federal and state income tax returns, as required. While he received financial 
counseling as part of his 2013 bankruptcy, his finances are not under control. There is 
insufficient evidence to conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. His 
failure to address his delinquent debts, and to file his 2013 and 2014 federal and state 
income tax returns as required, cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) do not apply. 
 
Conditions beyond his control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. For 
the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided corroborating 
documentation of his efforts to resolve his SOR debts. He has not demonstrated that he 
filed his 2013 and 2014 federal and state income tax returns, as required. There is 
insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
AG ¶ 20(b) is therefore only partially applicable.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I have considered Applicant’s honorable service with the U.S. military from 1981 
until he retired in 2003, and that he has worked for federal contractors since at least 
September 2006. I have considered that he was first granted a security clearance at the 
age of 19. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j, 1.l - 1.p:   Against Applicant  
 
Subparagraph 1.k:     Withdrawn 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
