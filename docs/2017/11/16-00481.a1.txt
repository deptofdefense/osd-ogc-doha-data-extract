APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On 
June 7, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On July 27, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant’s request for a
security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant has not raised an issue of harmful error by the Judge.  He provides some
information about the status of his delinquent debts, much of which is new evidence.  We cannot
consider new evidence upon appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  We do not review a case de novo.  Our
scope of review is limited to cases in which the appealing party raises an issue of harmful error.  See,
e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03935 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 11, 2017).  There being none, the decision is
AFFIRMED.
