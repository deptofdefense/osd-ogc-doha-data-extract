HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided sufficient evidence of progress towards resolution of his 
financial issues. Circumstances beyond his control harmed his finances. In the past three 
years, Applicant paid over $100,000 to address the debts on his statement of reasons 
(SOR). All SOR debts are resolved. Financial considerations security concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.       
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On July 16, 2014, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit (GE) 1. On October 
15, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006. Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations 
guideline. HE 2. 
 
On December 1, 2016, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he 
requested a hearing. HE 3. On December 13, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to

proceed. On July 5, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On July 5, 2017, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for July 11, 2017. HE 1. Applicant had 15 days of informal notice of the hearing. Transcript 
(Tr.) 14-15. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant offered 
nine exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. Tr. 18-23; GE 1-7; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-I. On July 19, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. On October 11, 2017, Applicant provided five 
exhibits, which were admitted without objection. AE J-AE N. The record closed on 
October 11, 2017. Tr. 64-65. 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1

The SOR alleges and record establishes the status of Applicant’s accounts as 
follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off bank debt for $121,646. On November 6, 2016, 
the creditor wrote that Applicant had made 29 payments of $810 for a total of $23,490, 
and he had seven $810 payments remaining for a total of $5,670. SOR response, Ex. B. 
On July 7, 2017, the creditor wrote the debt was “settled in full” on June 20, 2017. Tr. 33-
34; AE E.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off bank debt for $38,581. On June 29, 2015, 
Applicant retained a law firm to assist in the settlement of the debt. Tr. 57-58; SOR 
response, Ex. D. Applicant paid $14,673 to the creditor. Tr. 35-38; SOR response at 5. 
He made some payments through garnishment; and then the creditor agreed to stop the 
garnishment in November 2015. Tr. 36-38. In 2015, Applicant offered to settle the debt 
for $10,000, and the creditor could retain the payments made to date. Tr. 40. He has 
$10,000 available to settle the debt, and he said he would pay the debt once a settlement 
agreement is established. Tr. 58, 61. On October 11, 2017, the creditor advised him that 
the creditor had decided to release him of his obligation to pay the remaining debt. AE J. 
He is waiting for the IRS Form 1099-C showing his tax responsibility for the portion of the 
debt that was discharged. AE J. The debt was removed from his current credit report. AE 
J; AE K. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a tax lien entered against Applicant in 2013 for $59,516. The 
lien was $39,295 for tax year 2007 and $20,221 for tax year 2008. AE M. On November 
10, 2016, Applicant and the IRS agreed on an installment payment plan in which Applicant 
agreed to pay $414 monthly until resolution of his $5,862 tax debt for tax year 2007, and 
$21,114 tax debt for tax year 2008. SOR response, Ex. H 
 
On February 25, 2011, while Applicant was deployed to Iraq, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) filed his tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008. Tr. 41-42; AE B; AE C. 
Applicant believed his tax returns for those two years were already filed. For Applicant’s

4 
                                         
 
For Applicant’s tax debt for the 2008 tax year, he made the following payments: 
March 2, 2015 ($1,500); June 2, 2015 ($950); July 1, 2015 ($950); November 16, 2016

and the balance owed is zero. Tr. 45, 56; AE C; AE D.   
 
Applicant had tax problems in part because he erroneously thought all of his 
income received while deployed overseas was tax free, and actually, $96,000 was tax 
free. Tr. 44. All of his taxes are now paid. Tr. 44-47; AE C. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $59. On March 5, 2015, 
the creditor acknowledged Applicant’s medical debt was paid. SOR response, Ex. I.   
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a debt owed to a city placed for collection for $65. On November 
15, 2016, the city acknowledged Applicant’s parking ticket was paid. SOR response, Ex. 
J.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $124. On November 21, 
2016, Applicant paid the debt for $127. SOR response, Ex. L.  
 
Applicant’s October 11, 2017 combined credit report shows scores of 731 and 741 
(very good) and 680 (good). AE K. His October 11, 2017 Equifax credit report shows 23 
accounts in “pays as agreed” status, and two accounts as “lost or stolen card” both with 
a zero balance. AE N. There are no negative entries on his October 11, 2017 Equifax 
credit report. AE N.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
5 
                                         
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 
6 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;4  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
                                            
4 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
Applicant’s credit reports indicate that one of his debts was in charged-off status. 
Eventually the charged-off debt will be dropped from his credit report. “[T]hat some debts 
have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR 
Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 
(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most 
negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency 
or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever 
is longer.5 Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe 
the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting 
company’s request for information, or when the debt has been charged off.  
 
Divorce, the real estate downturn, and his daughter’s medical problems were 
circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. He received 
financial counseling. In the last three years, Applicant paid more than $100,000 to his 
SOR creditors, and he has settled and resolved all of the SOR debts. AG ¶ 20(a) through 
20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(g) applies to his federal income tax debt because he had an 
installment plan with the IRS, and he complied with that agreement.     
 
Based on Applicant’s track record of paying or resolving his debts, future new 
delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” His payments to address his debts showed 
good faith. He has sufficient income to keep his debts in current status and to continue 
making progress paying his remaining debts. Applicant assures he will conscientiously 
endeavor to maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 58 years old, and he is employed as a system engineer and consultant 
for a government contractor. He has 186 college credits from various institutions; 
however, he has not received a degree. He served in the Air Force and Air National Guard 
from 1981 to 2001, and he was honorably discharged as a master sergeant. He was 
deployed to Southwest Asia for Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was married from 1979 
to 2006, and his children are ages 31 and 36. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan 
for a total of about three years. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of 
alcohol, or use of illegal drugs. 
 
Divorce, unemployment, the real estate downturn, and his daughter’s medical 
problems were circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. He 
received financial counseling. In the last three years, Applicant paid more than $100,000, 
and he has settled and resolved all of the SOR debts. His October 11, 2017 Equifax credit 
report shows 23 accounts in “pays as agreed” status, and there are no negative entries 
on this credit report. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person 
analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). He understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. He took reasonable actions under his particular financial 
circumstances to address his delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
 
10 
                                         
 
track record” of debt re-payment, and he assures he will maintain his financial 
responsibility.6 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

6 Failure to maintain financial responsibility in the future may raise a security concern. The 
Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. The 
Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, 
and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking 
it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or 
circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-
06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, 
conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 
18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary security 
clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her financial 
problems.”). This footnote does not imply that granting Applicant’s security clearance is conditional.
