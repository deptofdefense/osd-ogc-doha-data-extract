GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: 
On April 19, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence.1 
Applicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2017, and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 23, 2017. The hearing was 
held as scheduled on July 27, 2017. On October 26, 2017, I proposed to the parties that 
this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department 
Counsel did not object.   
Applicant is a 62-year-old, U.S. citizen who has worked for a defense contractor 
since June 2015. He is a linguist. He has worked for the U.S. Government directly and 
as a contractor for the past 36 years. He held a security clearance in connection with his 
employment from 2005 to 2015. He deployed to Iraq four times as a linguist. He is 
1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines,

married to a naturalized U.S. citizen. His two children are natural born U.S. citizens. (Tr. 
28, 38-40.) 
 
Applicant was born in Iraq and is Kurdish. He sought refugee status in 1980 in 
Australia after Applicant and his father were tortured by the Iraqi Government. He 
immigrated to the United States in 1981. He became a U.S. citizen in 1987. He earned 
a bachelor’s degree in 1987. (Tr. 30-33.) 
 
Applicant’s 80-year-old mother is a citizen of Iraq and currently resides in 
Sweden. She travels back and forth between the two nations. She is supported by 
Applicant’s siblings and retirement benefits in Sweden. He has two brothers and one 
sister who also reside in Sweden. Applicant does not provide his mother any financial 
support. (Tr. 40-43.) 
 
Additionally, Applicant has two sisters and one brother who are citizens and 
residents of Iraq. They all reside in a Kurdish city. His sisters are teachers. Applicant 
speaks to them once to twice per month. His brother works in a private business 
distributing food. Applicant has not spoken to his brother in two years. (Tr. 44-47.) 
 
Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She is a 70-year-old 
housewife. Applicant provides no financial support to his mother-in-law. (Tr. 49.)  
 
Applicant is active within his local community in the United States as evidenced 
by numerous letters of recommendation and certificates of appreciation. He owns a 
home and has retirement savings in the United States. His loyalty is to the United 
States. (Applicant Exhibits B through D; Tr. 55.) 
  
Mitigating conditions set out in AG ¶¶ 8(a) through 8(c) have been established by 
the evidence. There is no doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered whether the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also gave due consideration to the whole-
person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him national 
security eligibility for access to classified information. This case is decided for Applicant.
