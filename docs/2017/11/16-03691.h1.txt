KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant mitigated security concerns raised by his problematic 
financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on June 12, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On December 30, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
him eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
2 
 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on February 2, 2017, and requested a decision based on 
the written record without a hearing.   
 
On February 27, 2017, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on March 6, 2017, and he received it on 
March 9, 2017. He was given 30 days to file objections and submit material to refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence.3 Applicant responded to the FORM 
on April 7, 2017, and submitted documents that I have marked as Applicant’s Exhibit A 
(AE A) (pages 1 through 14). They are admitted into evidence without objection. The case 
was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were five items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4.4 Exhibits 1, 3, and 4 are admitted into evidence. 
Exhibit 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took 
place during the August 2015 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated, as 
required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s written brief includes a 
footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to 
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. The footnote is 
prominently prefaced with a bolded, upper-case notice to Applicant and flagging for 
Applicant the importance of the footnote, which then explains the concepts of 
authentication and waiver. In a case such as this, where Applicant has responded to the 
FORM, it is fair to conclude that Applicant read the footnote, understood it, and chose not 
to object to the ROI. The ROI (GE 2) is, therefore, admitted into evidence.   
  
 
                                                          
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. Revised 
Adjudicative Guidelines were issued on December 10, 2016, and became effective on June 8, 2017. My 
decision and formal findings are made under the revised Guideline F.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated March 6, 2017, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated March 9, 2017. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 
days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR and Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and the Answer are the 
pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 2 through 5 are marked as GE 1 through 4.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 38 years old, married with two children, ages 5 and 16. He is a high 
school graduate with some college credits. Since December 2015, he has been employed 
by a defense contractor.6 
 
The SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts totaling $37,234. Applicant has admitted 
seven of those debts but denied four of them. His answer to the SOR and his response 
to the FORM explain the status of each debt and how he is addressing them.  
 
 Applicant has enrolled four SOR debts in a debt consolidation program.7 Those 
debts are SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.j. Applicant documented that: (1) those four debts 
were enrolled; (2) that he has opened a bank account dedicated solely to making 
automatic monthly payments on those debts; and (3) he has a track record of those 
payments being made.8 
 
Applicant documented that he is current on payment plans for the debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g.9 He also documented that he has paid off the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1e. and 1.f.10 
 
Applicant established that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is a duplicate of the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ b., which is already under a payment plan.11 Finally, Applicant 
documented that he paid off the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k.12 
 
In sum, Applicant has paid off or is paying off all of the non-duplicative debts 
alleged in the SOR.

8 Answer ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.j and pp. 14, 22, and 28; AE A, pp. 7-8. Applicant contends that SOR ¶ 1.a is a 
duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.h. The record supports his contention. GE 3 shows the debt owed to the original 
creditor in the same amount as is later owed to the collection agent. GE 4. The amount alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.h is the high credit, but there is no balance due. GE 4.

Law and Policies 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.13 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”14 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.15 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.16 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.17 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.18 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.19 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.20 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21

Discussion 
  
Guideline F - Financial Considerations  
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,22 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.23 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and,  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
During the security clearance process, evidence was developed that showed 
Applicant had a problematic financial history. That history raised security concerns under 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). The next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions 
apply. 
 
In his responses to the SOR and the FORM, Applicant demonstrated that he has 
paid or is in the process of paying his SOR debts. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and (d) apply.  
                                                          
22 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
23 AG ¶ 18.

The evidence of Applicant’s current financial condition does not raise doubts about 
his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. 
In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the 
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due 
consideration to the whole-person concept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has 
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.25 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.k:                   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
