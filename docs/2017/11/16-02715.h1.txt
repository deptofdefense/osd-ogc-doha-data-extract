HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
On December 2, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. On June 8, 
2017, the AGs were updated and the AGs effective September 1, 2006 were cancelled.  
This decision will be decided based on the new AGs effective on June 8, 2017.  If I were 
to consider this case under the AGs effective September 1, 2006, it would result in the 
same outcome.  
  
 On January 9, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 
8, 2017. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 20, 2017. An 
original hearing date was scheduled for August 31, 2017. Applicant requested a 
continuance and the request was granted. On August 25, 2017, a Notice of Hearing was 
issued rescheduling the hearing for September 25, 2017. The case was transferred to 
me several days before the hearing and the hearing was held as scheduled. During the 
 
2 
 
 
hearing, the Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government 
Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5.  Applicant testified and offered four exhibits which were admitted 
as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A – D. The record was held open until October 10, 2017, to 
allow the Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a 19-
page document on October 10, 2017, which was admitted as AE E. The transcript (Tr.) 
was received on October 3, 2017. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.     
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is an employee of a Department of Defense contractor seeking to 
maintain a security clearance. She has worked for her current employer since January 
2014. She has worked for various DoD contractors for thirty years. She has held a 
security clearance since 1990. She has a master’s degree and has done some work 
towards her doctorate. She is married and has four daughters, ages 19, 17, 15, and 12.   
(Tr. 60-61; Gov 1; Answer to SOR)   
 
In 2013, Applicant submitted a security clearance application for access to 
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In her application, she disclosed tax issues 
from 2007 to 2010 and 2012.  Her access to SCI was granted in 2013 as a “cross over” 
clearance.  (Tr. 23, 64-65; Gov 1, section 26) 
 
On August 17, 2014, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for 
investigation processing (e-QIP) as part of a periodic reinvestigation for her security 
clearance. In response to section 26 of the e-QIP application, Applicant listed that she 
owed federal income taxes for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. Applicant’s security 
clearance background investigation resulted in the the following SOR allegations: failure 
to file Federal and state income taxes for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 
2014, and 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 2 at 26);  a $130,905 debt owed to the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 2 at 6-8); a $72,311 debt 
owed to the IRS for tax year 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 2 at 9); a $211,100 debt owed to the 
IRS for tax year 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 2 at 10); an $85,124 tax debt owed to the IRS 
for tax year 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 11); a $56,384 debt owed to the IRS for tax year 
2012 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 2 at 14);  a $30,557 debt owed to the IRS for tax year 2014 (SOR 
¶ 1.g: Gov 2 at 49); and a $788 debt owed to the IRS for tax year 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 
2 at 2. 68-78). 
 
Additional delinquent accounts include: a $3,516 state tax debt for tax year 2015 
(SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 2 at 2, 68-78); a $229 state tax debt for tax year 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 
2 at 103); a $13,808 car loan past due in the amount of $489 (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 4 at 2); a 
$620 medical account that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 4 at 2); a $448 
collection account (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 4 at 2); a $324 medical account that was placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.n: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 7); and a $304,000 tax lien entered against 
Applicant in March 2012 by the IRS. (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 5 at 2).

Applicant and her husband were active in purchasing undervalued residential 
properties, fixing them up and selling them at a profit. They successfully profited with 
the purchase and sale of three residential properties between 1994 and 2002. In 2002, 
they purchased a 7-acre property at a good price because of a house fire. Their plan 
was to tear down the fire-damaged house and build their dream home. They were 
paying a mortgage on the residence that they were living in, a mortgage on the newly 
purchased land, and a construction loan. (Response to SOR; Gov 1, section 26) 
 
Construction began on the new home in 2004. An occupancy permit was issued 
in 2006, and Applicant and her family moved into the new home. Applicant’s ability to 
sell the residence they were living in prior to moving into the new home was severely 
affected by a downturn in the real estate market. The house stayed on the market for 
months longer than anticipated. This resulted in Applicant and her husband making 
double mortgage payments for longer than anticipated. The new home they recently 
moved into was underwater. It took Applicant 18 months to convert the construction 
loan to a mortgage. The mortgage was about $1.7 million. The downturn in the real 
estate market resulted in the sale of Applicant’s  previous residence at a loss; having a 
higher than anticipated mortgage payment on Applicant’s new residence, and Applicant 
becoming late on payments towards other creditors. (Tr. 31-35; Gov 1, section 26 at 45-
47; Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 2; Response to SOR) 
 
Applicant earns about $170,000 annually. She usually receives a bonus of 
approximately $70,000 annually.  Her income totals approximately $240,000 a year. 
She did not receive a bonus during the sequestration in 2013. Applicant’s husband was 
laid off in February 2011. Since that time, her husband has not earned much income. 
He has been trying to set up his own business. His current business is going well and 
they anticipate it will soon generate significant income. Applicant’s husband handles all 
of the financial accounts. (Tr. 30, 56-60, 63, 73, 83; Gov 3 at 2; AE C; AE E at 6) 
 
In order to maintain their mortgage payments, Applicant and her husband used 
all of their savings including their 401(k) accounts, which resulted in tax penalties. They 
attempted to modify their loan. When that was not successful, they attempted a short 
sale. The lender did not approve the short sale. They moved out of the residence in 
August 2014 and it went to foreclosure in November 2014. (Tr. 31-34; Gov 3 at 3)  
 
In 2009, Applicant and her husband consulted a commercial tax business to help 
them to reduce their tax debts through an offer in compromise. This was unsuccessful. 
In 2012, they hired a tax attorney who advised them an offer in compromise would not 
be successful. He recommended a payment plan. They submitted an installment 
agreement request (IRS Form 433A) to the IRS on June 6, 2012, with an offer to pay 
$3,500 a month.  Having never heard from the IRS, Applicant and her husband did not 
think the tax attorney was progressing in resolving their tax debts. They hired another 
tax professional recently who is helping them prepare a request for an amended IRS 
Form 433-A repayment agreement. The proposed offer would be to pay $5,200 a month 
towards the federal tax debt. (Tr. 26-29, 31, 66-68, 72; Gov 1, section 26; Gov 3 at 3; 
Response to SOR; AE  E at 2-8)

Applicant states that her household finances are more manageable now that they 
have a lower house payment. They no longer use credit cards and only pay with a debit 
card. They have taken financial classes through their church. She also attended 
financial counseling sessions arranged through her Employee Assistance Program. (Tr. 
41-42; Gov 3 at 4; AE C)  
 
The status of the SOR debts are: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a: Failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2007, 
2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015:  All federal tax returns were filed as indicated 
by the IRS transcripts, dated September 25, 2017, submitted by Applicant during the 
hearing. The returns for tax years 2007-2009 were filed in October 2010. The return for 
tax year 2010 was filed in February 2012. The return for tax year 2012 was filed in 
October 2013.  The returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 were filed in November 2016. 
The return for tax year 2016 was filed in August 2017. Applicant owes $21,801 for tax 
year 2016.  The 2016 tax debt was not alleged in the SOR, and will not be considered 
for disqualification purposes, but will be considered as a matter in extenuation and 
mitigation. (AE B)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b -1.h:  Past due federal income taxes for tax years 2007-2010, 2012, 
2014 and 2015, total approximate balance, $587,169: In a letter dated October 3, 2017,  
Applicant’s tax professional concluded that Applicant could afford to pay $5,202 a 
month toward a payment plan with the IRS. An amended IRS 433-A was created 
indicating the new figure and adding the additional tax years. Applicant anticipates that 
the amended 433-A will be signed and sent to the IRS within 30 days. At the close of 
the record the IRS had not approved the payment plan and no payment plan has been 
established. (Tr. 29, 72, 74; AE E at 2-8) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i:  $3,516 state tax debt for tax year 2014: Applicant is making 
payments toward this tax debt.  (Tr. 36-37; AE B at 2; AE E at 9-11) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j:  $229 state tax debt for tax year 2015: Applicant paid this debt in 
2017. (Tr. 36-37; AE B at 1; AE E at 12, 18)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.k:  $13,808 car loan that is past due in the amount of $489: Applicant is 
making payments on this debt.  (Tr. 37; AE E at 15) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l: $620 medical account placed for collection: The debt is paid in full.   
(Tr. 38; AE E at 16)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.m:  $448 collection account: The debt is settled and paid. (Tr. 38-39; AE 
E at 17) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n:  $324 medical account placed for collection: Applicant claims this 
debt is paid, but did not provide a receipt or other proof that the debt was paid. (Tr. 39;     
AE E at 19)  
 
5 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o:  $304,000 Federal tax lien entered against Applicant in March 2012: 
This lien is related to the federal income tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.h. It is 
unpaid.  
   
Whole-person Factors 
 
 Applicant is successful in her field as shown in her resume. (AE D) An official 
with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Energy, Installations and 
Environment states that “[Applicant is absolutely one of the few Industry experts I can 
consistently count on for thoughtful leadership and corporate partnership in my role as a 
Cybersecurity Program Manager within the Department of Defense.” He describes 
Applicant as “an industry thought leader: and skillful collaborator who participates in 
several professional councils.” He has no concerns about her ability to protect sensitive 
unclassified information or classified information. (AE A at 1)  
 
 A retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel has served as Applicant’s supervisor for 
nearly 20 years with five different companies. He describes Applicant as a leading 
subject matter expert in her field. She has worked on a number of vital government 
security missions. He is aware of Applicant’s financial issues and states that Applicant 
disclosed her financial situation to him as well as the corporate security staff. He has 
never had any concerns about her dedication and commitment to protecting classified 
information. (AE A at 2-3)  
 
 Applicant’s current reporting official states that Applicant has proven herself to be 
a capable business leader and expert in her field. He describes her as “a highly-
analytical and well-spoken professional who is called on regularly by company 
leadership and key clients to advise on important issues. Applicant disclosed her 
financial issues to corporate leadership and the security office. Her financial issues have 
not affected her performance in the workplace and she continues to excel in her career 
without security incidents. (AE A at 4)  
 
 Applicant prides herself on having built a solid reputation on leading 
organizations with integrity and always doing the right thing. She states she is not prone 
to criminal acts, espionage or any other negative activity to generate funds. She has 
never compromised classified information. Her marital and family relationships are 
stable. She is active in her church and her children’s school. She takes her obligations 
seriously. She states she and her husband have worked hard to prioritize and fulfill their 
financial obligations. Applicant believes her financial situation is beginning to improve. 
She claims the Statement of Reasons allegations are not the product of irresponsible 
behavior, but the result of prioritizing and working through their financial obligations. (Tr. 
85; Response to SOR; AE E at 19)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national 
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information).

GUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. 
The disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant’s case include: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant encountered financial problems resulting from her real estate 
investments and the downturn of the housing market in 2006.  She and her husband 
also owe delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 
2014, and 2015, with an approximate balance of over $587,000. She also incurred 
delinquent state income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015, with an approximate total of 
$3,745. She also incurred four delinquent debts, with an approximate total of $ 1,881.  
AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to Applicant’s case.  
   
An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or careless in her obligations to protect classified information. Behaving 
irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in 
other aspects of life. A person’s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until 
evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under 
agreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
 
8 
 
 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk 
inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial 
obligations.  
 
With regard to Applicant’s federal tax debts, the recent emphasis of the DOHA 
Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case 
No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and 
stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking 
action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that 
Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of 
rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR 
Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR 
Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting not all tax returns filed). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 
(App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, and stating “A security 
clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of 
national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a 
direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information.”).  
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  
 
AG ¶ 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
 
9 
 
 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control:  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply because Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing. 
Including the 2016 tax debt that was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant owes over 
$600,000 to the IRS for delinquent federal taxes for eight tax years.  Having had a 
security clearance for over 30 years, Applicant should have been aware of her duty to 
file and pay federal income taxes in a timely manner. She is given credit for disclosing 
her tax issues on her security clearance application in 2014 and during an SCI 
investigation in 2013.  However, she was not proactive in seeing that her federal tax 
debts were being resolved. In fact, she continued to incur federal tax debts for tax years 
2014, 2015 and 2016. Applicant’s neglect of her duty to file and pay federal income 
taxes raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because Applicant’s financial situation was adversely 
affected by the housing market downturn in 2006, her husband’s job loss in 2011, and 
the 2013 sequestration period. These were all matters that were beyond Applicant’s 
control. However, this mitigating condition is given less weight because I cannot 
conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Although Applicant’s 
husband’s job loss resulted in the loss of $150,000 to the household income, Applicant 
earned over $240,000 based on her salary and bonus.  This should have been sufficient 
to pay the household bills as well as the tax debts, but Applicant incurred delinquent tax 
debts over an eight year period.   
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies because Applicant has attended financial counseling 
through her church and through her employee assistance program.  Most of her 
consumer debts have been resolved. However, the federal tax debts remain 
unresolved.  For this reason, the mitigating condition is given less weight.  
 
 AG & 20(d) applies towards the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i – 1.m because 
Applicant resolved or is resolving these debts. However, I cannot conclude that she has 
made a good-faith effort regarding her tax debts. Even after submitting a repayment 
agreement to the IRS in 2012, Applicant continued to incur delinquent federal tax debts. 
While Applicant recently retained another tax professional, I cannot conclude that she 
demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her federal tax debts because more tax 
debts were incurred each year and no payment arrangement has been reached with the 
IRS. 
 
 
10 
 
 
AG & 20(g) does not apply. While Applicant has sought the assistance of a new 
tax professional and an amended repayment agreement was prepared. At the close of 
the record, it had not been submitted to the IRS and no payment agreement was 
established. It is unclear whether Applicant actively pursued the initial payment 
agreement with the IRS that was submitted in 2012. While she claims her attorney was 
nonresponsive, she could have taken action to terminate his services and to pursue an 
agreement with the IRS earlier than she did. If Applicant had actively pursued this 
agreement, made timely payments toward the agreement, and timely filed and paid her 
income tax returns for subsequent tax years, this mitigating condition would apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s successful 
career, as well as her 30 years of possessing a security clearance without incident. I 
considered the favorable reference letters of her supervisors and senior officials within 
her career field who praise her capabilities, work ethic, and trustworthiness. I 
considered that she is a loving wife and mother.  
 
 I considered that the downturn in the housing market and her husband’s 
unemployment and underemployment since 2011 has adversely affected the household 
finances. However, Applicant earns a good income. A question remains about how 
Applicant and her husband continued to incur delinquent federal tax debts covering   
eight tax years between 2007 and 2016.  Applicant claims that their first tax professional 
was not responsive. However, Applicant was not proactive in bringing her federal tax 
situation under control. Applicant is given credit for her honesty. She is also given credit 
for resolving her state tax debts and several consumer debts.  Yet, she continued to 
have federal income tax issues and just recently sought the assistance of a tax

professional. No repayment agreement was resolved at the close of the record. While 
Applicant’s husband’s business may begin to generate income this year, such an 
assertion is speculative and does not account for incurring federal tax debts when the 
household annual income was on average $240,000. The issues related to unresolved 
$600,000 federal tax debts remains. Security concerns under financial considerations 
are not mitigated.
