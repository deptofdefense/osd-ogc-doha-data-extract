 Decision
______________
WESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony. I conclude that
Applicant  mitigated trust concerns regarding her finances. Eligibility for holding a public
trust position is granted.   
 
History of the Case
On December 1, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated
Adjudication Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons
why DOD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of
whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position, and recommended referral to an
administrative judge to determine whether eligibility to hold a public trust position should
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20,
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the
Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs).
Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent Directive
(SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for all
covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position were established to supercede all
previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Procedures for
administrative due process for contractor personnel continue to be governed by DOD
Directive 5220.6, subject to the updated substantive changes in the AGs, effective June
8, 2017. Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would
not change the decision in this case.
Applicant responded to the SOR on January 5, 2017, and requested a hearing.
This case was assigned to me on March 14, 2017. The case was scheduled for hearing
on April 4, 2017. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,
continue, deny, or revoke Applicant’s application for eligibility to hold a public trust
position. At the hearing, the Government’s case consisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4);
Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 34 exhibits. The transcript was received in
May 2017 and followed with a replacement transcript on October 26, 2017.  
Summary of Pleadings
 Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to timely file federal income tax
returns for tax years 2007-2015, as required; (b) failed to file state income tax returns
for tax years 2007-2015, as required; (c) incurred a federal tax lien in December 2014
covering delinquent taxes owed for $409,070 and $59,285, respectively; and (d)
incurred three federal tax liens in December 2014 for $2,287, in July 2013 for $100,511,
and in December 2012 for $3,105, all of which have since been released by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant’s alleged untimely tax filings and delinquent federal
tax debts allegedly have not been resolved.  
In her response to the SOR, Applicant denied failing to file her 2007 federal tax
return, claiming she filed the return in June 2008 with an extension. She admitted  to
failing to timely file her federal tax returns for tax years 2008-2015, as required. She
claimed she and her husband filed her federal tax returns for these tax years late as
follows: 2008 federal tax return in February 2011; 2009 federal tax return in June 2012;
2010 federal tax return in November 2011; 2011 federal tax return in July 2013; 2012
federal tax return in October 2013 with a timely extension; 2013 federal tax return in
October 2014 with a timely extension; 2014 federal tax return in September 2015 with a
timely extension; and 2015 federal tax return in September 2016 with a timely
extension. 
Addressing her state tax returns, Applicant denied failing to timely file her state
income tax returns for tax years 2007-2015. Citing the lack of information from her
husband (a practicing physician) to either affirm or deny of failures to file for the years in
issue, she claimed she had $5,097 in state income taxes withheld from her 2015 wages
2
and has no balance owed to her state taxing authority. Applicant also denied having
any other unsatisfied federal tax liens.  She claimed the IRS released these federal tax
liens in January 2016 after Applicant and her husband paid the balances owed for the
tax years in issue.
Findings of Fact
 Applicant is a 63-year-old registered nurse for a defense health contractor who
seeks eligibility to hold a public trust position. The allegations covered in the SOR and
admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings
follow.
Background
                                  
Applicant married in April 1983 (GE 1; Tr. 74-76) and filed for divorce from her
husband in January 2016 after 33 years of marriage, and still awaits a final divorce
decree. (GE 1 AE DD; Tr. 97-99) Since 2007, Applicant and her husband (a practicing
cardiologist) have lived apart and interacted infrequently. (Tr. 76, 96) Applicant has one
daughter from her marriage who attends college in another state. (GEs 1-2) 
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in nursing in May 2016. (GEs 1-2) She
reported no military service. Since July 2004 (a period of over 13 years), Applicant has
worked for her current employer. (GEs 1-2) As a registered nurse, she maintains
telephonic communications with TRICARE beneficiaries and their spouses concerning
health care claims of active and non-active military service members. (Tr. 73) 
Finances
While married and living separately between 2004 and 2007, Applicant and her
husband timely filed joint federal and state tax returns and received refunds most of the
time. (AE J; Tr. 77-79, 83-85, 130-131) However, between 2008 and 2012, she and her
husband failed to file their federal and state returns in a timely manner, as required.
(GEs 1-2; Tr. 85-91, 134-136) When she received notices from the IRS during these
years, she faxed them to the IRS herself without informing them of either her ongoing
contacts with her husband by phone and personal visits or her lack of tax information.
(Tr. 78, 82-83) 
 Applicant attributed her federal and state filing delays to insufficient information
furnished by her husband (who at the time was working in different communities as a
practicing physician) to enable her to file accurate returns. (GE 2; Tr. 85-87) Residing in
a community property state throughout the tax years in issue, Applicant’s tax filings
required the merger of her modest income and expenses with the more significant
income of her husband for tax reporting purposes for both her federal and state tax
returns. (AEs K-N; Tr. 139) Without tax information from her husband or tax accountant
for tax years 2008-2011, she was ill-equipped to file accurate federal or state returns.
3
(AEs K-O, X-Y; Tr. 86-87, 93-94) Whether their tax accountant could have provided
beneficial filing guidance to Applicant under these circumstances is unclear. Certainly,
the absence of any paper trail of Applicant inquiries of the accountant creates
considerable uncertainty as to what tax filing guidance was available to Applicant over
the course of the tax-filing years in issue. (Tr. 125-127)
Between 2008 and 2015, Applicant and her husband lived essentially separate
lives in different states. (Tr. 85) She traveled infrequently to other states to assist her
husband and obtain needed financial tax information to enable her to file her tax returns
for the years in issue. (Tr. 85, 94-95) During these years she and her husband were not
legally separated despite their physical separation and infrequent communications.  For
the most part during this 2008-2011 time period, she received little or no cooperation
from her husband in providing necessary tax information (to include income sharing of
his income and expenses) and was unsuccessful in obtaining the information. (Tr. 86-
87) 
Community property publications issued by the IRS confirm Applicant’s
expressed good-faith belief that in her state of residence (a community property state)
she cannot file a federal tax return separately from her spouse without reporting one-
half of all community income and all of her separate income. (AE GG at 3) In
Applicant’s state, community income is defined as income generated from services
performed by either or both spouses during their marriage. (AE GG) By virtue of the
laws of Applicant’s state of residency, Applicant’s income for the tax years in issue
constituted community income that required reporting income for herself and her
husband.  See IRS publication 555, at 3 (Feb. 2016). (AE GG)
Because of Applicant’s good-faith belief that she could not legally file separate
federal and state tax returns without information covering the included income and
expenses of her husband,  she never considered filing best-effort separate tax returns
with the IRS and her state taxing authority accompanied by explanatory
correspondence. Legally, of course, spouses living apart all year, and who meet the
special rules applicable to spouses residing in community property states, must report
individual income earned by the spouse who performed the services to earn the
income. See IRS publication 555, supra, at 8. 
Were Applicant aware of the IRS community-generated income reporting
requirements, she would have been expected to file separate returns for the years in
issue with the tax information and more than adequate tax withholding credits available
and known to her. (AE J; Tr. 132) In turn, income generated from her husband solely
from his medical practice and not known to her would have been exempted from tax
liability. See IRS publication 555, supra, at 7. Applicant’s accepted lack of
understanding of these IRS filing requirements and exemptions are sufficient in these
circumstances to justify her multiple failures to file timely separate federal and state tax
returns for tax years 2008-2012.
4
With the additional tax information her husband provided her for tax years 2013-
2015, Applicant and her husband were able to timely file their 2013-2015 federal and
state tax returns timely with the aid of extensions. (AEs J-Q and R-Z; Tr. 90-96) And
with the tax information supplied by her husband and accountant, she and her husband
filed late federal and state tax returns for the back years of 2008-2011 with implicit IRS
approvals. (AEs S-W; Tr. 95-96). 
Asked about the status of her 2016 federal and state taxes, Applicant assured
her 2016 federal taxes will be filed timely with no estimated taxes owed the IRS. (Tr. 81-
82, 95-96) Applicant’s assurances are credible and are accepted.
IRS tax records confirm that the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant in
December 2014 for $409,000 and $59,285, respectively, covering delinquent federal
income taxes owed for tax years 2009-2013. (AEs AA-CC BB; Tr. 93-95)  Broken down,
the $409,000 tax lien  covered assessed taxes of $189,409 for tax year 2010, $132,983
for tax year 2011, $84,389 for tax year 2012 and $2,287 for tax year 2013. (AE BB) The
$59,285 tax lien filed  by the IRS in December 2014 covered taxes owed for tax year
2009. (AE AA) Two other tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS: one for
$100,511 in July 2012 and another for $3,105 in December 2012. State collection
actions against Applicant covering the 2009-2014  tax periods were previously resolved
and are not included in the SOR. (AE FF)
 Since December 2014, Applicant and her husband have paid past-due tax debts
owed the IRS for tax years 2008-2013 and secured releases of IRS-generated tax liens.
(AEs AA-CC; Tr. 93-94, 107-108) In January 2015, the IRS released its tax liens filed in
December 2014 (AEs AA-BB) The remaining two federal tax liens filed against
Applicant and covered in the SOR were released by the IRS in December 2015. (AE
CC) Federal and state tax records document that Applicant does not owe any federal or
state taxes to either the Federal Government or her state’s taxing authority for any of
the covered tax years between 2007 and 2015. (AEs AA-CC and FF; Tr. 95, 114-116) 
Character references
Applicant is highly-regarded by her supervisors and colleagues. (AE HH) They
characterize her as trustworthy and reliable with good judgment. None of her
supervisors or colleagues expressed any awareness of the financial issues covered in
the SOR. (AE HH) Applicant’s year-end performance evaluations for years 2009-2015
contain excellent assessments of Applicant’s performance qualities in all evaluated
rating categories. (AE EE)  
Policies
The new AGs in SEAD 4 for use in contractor cases covered by the process
provided by DOD 5220.6 list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the
decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account
5
factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well
as considerations that could affect the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified [sensitive] information. 
The guidelines include conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern
[public trust position] and may be disqualifying” (disqualifying conditions), if any, and
many of the conditions that could mitigate [trustworthiness concerns.
The AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility to hold a
public trust position should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not
require administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying
and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines
is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG ¶ 2(a). 
In addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG ¶ 2(a) of
the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial
commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines
within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine
a sufficient period of an applicant’s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about
whether the applicant is an acceptable public trust risk. 
When evaluating an applicant’s conduct, the relevant AGs are to be considered
together with whole-person factors. The following AG ¶ 2(d) factors are to be considered
along with the guidelines: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of
the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual
guideline is pertinent in this case:
Financial Considerations
The Concern: Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,
or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . An individual who is
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . .   AG ¶ 18.
6
Burden of Proof
By virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant
or continue an applicant's eligibility to hold a public trust position may be made only
upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national security
interest. Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a
commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate
determination of an applicant's eligibility for a public trust position depends, in large
part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin,
515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may
draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the
evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are
grounded on speculation or conjecture.
The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial
evidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that
the facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or
maintain public trust position eligibility. The required materiality showing, however,
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has
actually mishandled or abused privacy information before it can deny or revoke
eligibility to hold a public trust position. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the
cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect
privacy information.
Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted
or controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of
establishing his or her trustworthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or
mitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all [trustworthiness]
determinations be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the
ultimate burden of demonstrating his or her trust eligibility. “[T]rustworthiness]
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” See Department of the
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
Analysis  
Trustworthiness concerns are raised over Applicant’s history of failing to timely
file federal and state tax returns for tax years 2008-2012, and her incurring of federal
tax liens, one in December 2014 covering delinquent federal taxes of $409,000 and
$59,285, respectively, and three separate federal tax liens filed in 2012-2014 
covering aggregate delinquent federal taxes exceeding $105,000. 
Jurisdictional Issues
Holding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial
responsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor in
7
protecting and guarding personally identifiable information (PII). DOD Manual
5200.02, which incorporated and canceled DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, covers both
critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive national security positions for civilian
personnel. See 5200.02, ¶ 4.1a(3)(c)3.
Definitions for critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive positions provided in
5200.02, ¶ 4.1a (3)(c) contain descriptions similar to those used to define ADP l and II 
positions under DOD Regulation 5200.2-R.  (32 C.F.R. § 154.13 and Part 154, App. J)
ADP positions are broken down as follows in 32 C.F.R. § 154.13 and Part 154, App.
J): ADP l (critical-sensitive positions covering the direction, design, and planning of
computer systems) and ADP II (non-critical-sensitive positions covering the design,
operation, and maintenance of computer systems).  Considered together, the ADP I
and II positions covered in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R refine and explain the same
critical-sensitive and non-critical-sensitive positions covered in DOD Manual 5200.02,
¶ 4.1a (3)(c) and are reconcilable as included positions in 5200.02.  
So, while ADP trustworthiness positions are not expressly identified in DOD
Manual 5200.02, they are implicitly covered as non-critical sensitive positions that
require “access to automated systems that contain active duty, guard, or personally
identifiable information or information pertaining to Service members that is otherwise
protected from disclosure by DOD 5400.11-R. . . “. DOD 5200.02, Sec. 4.1, ¶ 3(c).
See DOD Directive 5220.6 ¶¶ D5(d) and D8. By virtue of the implied retention of ADP
definitions in DOD Manual 5200.02, ADP cases continue to be covered by the
process afforded by DOD 5220.6.  
Financial Concerns
Applicant’s federal and state tax-filing lapses and incurred delinquent federal
tax debts warrant the application of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the
AGs: DC ¶ 19(a), “inability to satisfy debts,” DC ¶ 19(b), “unwillingness to satisfy debts
regardless of the ability to do so,” DC ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial
obligations,” and DC ¶ 19(g), “failure to file Federal, state, or local income tax returns
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.” 
 Applicant’s pleading admissions with respect to her recurrent failures to timely
file her federal tax returns over a number of years (2008-2012) and incurred federal
tax liens covered in the SOR (SOR debts ¶¶ 1.u-1.w) negate the need for any
independent proof (see McCormick on Evidence, § 262 (6th ed. 2006)). Each of
Applicant’s filing lapses and incurred tax liens are fully documented in her response,
credit reports, and her interrogatory responses. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App.
Bd. Sep. 24, 2004). 
Financial stability in a person cleared to protect privacy information is required
precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a non-critical sensitive 
position. While the principal concern of a non-critical sensitive position holder’s
8
demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment
and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies.  
Extenuating circumstances contributed significantly to Applicant’s tax-filing
problems and incurred tax liens. Applicant’s financial problems have been marked by
periods of cooperation problems with her estranged husband. and heightened
financial burdens associated with the lack of financial information needed by Applicant
to file separate federal and state tax returns in a community property state. And while
IRS guidelines required her to file her separate returns with the best information
available to her for the years in issue, her good-faith belief that she could not file her
returns without including tax information from her spouse is enough to mitigate her
failures to timely file her separate federal and state returns with the individual
information available to her.
Considering the available testimonial and documented evidence, extenuating
circumstances in this record account for most of Applicant’s debt problems. Fully
available to Applicant is MC ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial
problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency,  a death, divorce, or separation, clear
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted
responsibly under the circumstances.” 
Applicant’s responsible efforts in addressing her late federal and state tax
returns and delinquent federal taxes enable her to meet the acting responsibly under
the circumstances prong of MC ¶ 20(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App.
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). In the
same vein, MC ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is adhering to a  good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” is available, too, to mitigate
Applicant’s untimely federal and state tax filings and delinquent federal tax debt
accumulations. And by (a) filing her late federal and state tax returns for tax years 2008-
2012 and timely for tax years 2007 and 2013-2015 and (b) paying all back taxes due for
each of those years to the satisfaction of the IRS, Applicant is entitled to the mitigating
benefits of MC ¶ 20(g), “the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.”
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance
of a “meaningful track record” that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
voluntary payment of debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)
(internal citations omitted) Applicant’s demonstrated debt payments are a significant
indicator of a meaningful plan she has adopted to address her debts. 
Whole-person assessment is favorable to Applicant. She has shown
considerable progress in addressing her federal and state tax returns (buttressed by her
good-faith belief that she could not file her separate returns without included tax
information from her husband) since regaining her estranged husband’s cooperation. In
a community property state like Applicant’s state of residence, both federal and state
9
tax filers filing separate tax returns are required to report one-half of all community
income and all of each separate filer’s income. This Applicant believed she could not
due without her husband’s full cooperation in providing necessary tax information. 
Once Applicant obtained her husband’s cooperation in providing his considerable 
community income and expenses, she was able to work with her him in providing joint
federal and state tax returns for the years in issue. For her corrective efforts, Applicant
is to be commended in doing all she could do to restore her finances to stable levels
consistent with meeting minimum requirements for holding a public trust position.
Important also to establishing her favorable whole-person status is the high
regard in which she is held by her supervisors and colleagues. Overall, public trust
eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the compiled documentation and her
corroborating testimony enables her to establish judgment and reliability levels sufficient
to overcome trust concerns associated with her late filing of her federal and state tax
returns for the years in issue and accumulation of federal tax liens covering delinquent
federal tax debts over a period of years (2008-2015). 
Taking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding
Applicant’s federal and state-filing lapses and accumulation of federal tax debts and
sufficient probative efforts to resolve her filing lapses and accumulated federal tax
debts, conclusions are warranted that her finances are sufficiently stabilized at this time
to grant her eligibility to hold a public trust position. Favorable conclusions are
warranted with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.w of
the SOR. Eligibility to hold a public trust position under the facts and circumstances is
fully consistent with the national interest.
Formal Findings
In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT
   
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.w:                For Applicant            
   
Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to hold a
public trust position.  Eligibility to hold a public trust position is granted.
