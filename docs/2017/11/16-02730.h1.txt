HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant made progress towards resolution of her financial issues. She has paid 
about $15,000 towards her student loans, and her student loans were removed from her 
credit report, leaving her with about $6,900 of non-student-loan delinquent debt. Due to 
her limited financial resources, she was unable to make greater progress on her finances. 
Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.       
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On September 24, 2015, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit (GE) 1. 
On October 13, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006. Hearing 
Exhibit (HE) 2. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. HE 2.

On November 7, 2016, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and she 
requested a hearing. HE 3. On December 13, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed. On July 5, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On August 2, 2017, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for September 6, 2017. HE 1. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered 
nine exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. Tr. 17-21; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-I. On September 14, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. On September 18, 2017, Applicant provided 
one exhibit, which was admitted without objection. AE J. The record closed on November 
6, 2017. Tr. 40. 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant was a teacher from 1994 to 2007. Tr. 25. From October 2007 to 
November 2014, a government contractor employed Applicant to support a non-DOD 
federal agency. Tr. 22. In 2014, she was earning $38,000 annually. Tr. 23. She quit that 
job because she was tired of the commute and wanted to provide more assistance with 
her daughter’s after-school activities. Tr. 23. She obtained part-time and then full-time 
employment from a store. Tr. 23. She currently earns $10.20 an hour or about $20,000 
annually. AE H. She currently has net income of $1,100 monthly. Tr. 24, 36. Applicant’s 
rent is $900 monthly, leaving her with about $200 for all of her other expenses. Tr. 36; AE 
I. She did not want to move out of the expensive metropolitan area where she currently 
resides because her daughter is a senior in high school. Tr. 35. If she obtains employment 
with the contractor sponsoring her clearance, she will be able to bring her debts to current 
status. Tr. 24. She anticipates her annual pay will double to about $40,000 annually. Tr. 
24. Applicant has been unable since 2015 to make any payments on any of her SOR 
debts, except for her student loans. Tr. 37. She attempted to get some creditors to accept 
payments of $5 or $10, and they refused to accept such small amounts. Tr. 38. 
 
The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $37,405, and the record establishes 
the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $3,674. In 2011, Applicant’s vehicle was 
totaled in an accident, and the amount owed is the amount left after her insurance was 
applied to her lien. Tr. 27.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.g allege six medical debts placed for collection for $601, 
$214, $135, $87, $66, and $1,318. Applicant and her daughter received surgeries. Tr. 29. 
She made some small payments on some of her medical debts before 2015. Tr. 30.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.k allege four student loans totaling $29,840 owed to the 
same creditor that were placed for collection for $8,504, $7,963, $7,961, and $5,414. 
Applicant believes the correct amount owed is about $14,000. Tr. 30-32. Payments to the 
creditor are automatically made from her pay through a garnishment that has been in 
effect for at least three years. Tr. 31. Her August 24, 2017 pay statement shows $1,677 
paid so far in 2017 to address her student loans. AE H. The IRS pays any tax refund she 
is entitled to receive to her student loan creditor. Tr. 32. On September 11, 2017, the 
creditor wrote that her current student loan debt was $14,050, and if the loan was 
rehabilitated, collection costs of $2,750 would be waived, leaving a total debt of $11,250. 
AE J. Her student loans are not listed on her August 3, 2016 credit report, which is the 
most recent credit report of record. GE 3. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges one student loan placed for collection for $725. Applicant 
borrowed the funds in 2013 or 2014. Tr. 33. This student loan is not listed on her August 
3, 2016 credit report, which is the most recent credit report of record. GE 3. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $666. Applicant contacted 
the creditor, and they were unable to locate any evidence of the debt. Tr. 33. This utility 
 
4 
                                         
 
debt is not listed on her August 3, 2016 credit report, which is the most recent credit report 
of record. GE 3. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a debt placed for collection for $79. Applicant had a copay from 
an ambulance she took to the hospital. Tr. 34. She believed her insurance company paid 
this debt. Tr. 41. This medical debt is not listed on her August 3, 2016 credit report, which 
is the most recent credit report of record. GE 3. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2005. Her nonpriority debts listed in her 
bankruptcy petition totaled $16,042. GE 4. 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided seven character statements from friends and coworkers. AE A-
AE G. The general sense of the statements is that Applicant is diligent, talented, cheerful, 
helpful, loyal, reliable, competent, honest, and professional. She makes important 
contributions to mission accomplishment. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
 
5 
                                         
 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
 
6 
                                         
 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).

proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $37,405. SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.k 
allege four student loans totaling $29,840. On September 11, 2017, the creditor wrote 
that her current student loan debt total was $14,050, and if the loan was rehabilitated, 
collection costs of $2,750 would be waived, leaving a total debt of $11,250. Her student 
loans are not listed on her August 3, 2016 credit report, which is the most recent credit 
report of record. She is credited with a current payment plan on her student loan.4 The 
non-student loan SOR debts total about $6,900. 
 
Medical problems, the needs of her parents and daughter, and underemployment 
harmed Applicant’s finances. Applicant’s current annual gross income is $20,000, and 
her net annual income is about $13,000. Her annual rent alone is $10,800. She does not 
have sufficient income to address her non-student-loan debts. If she receives a security 
clearance, she can obtain employment that will double her income and she will be able 
to resolve her remaining SOR debts. 
     
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the applicant had $41,000 in delinquent credit 
                                            
4 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of her salary even though her opportunity to establish a payment plan is reduced 
because of her limited income and other financial commitments. Payment of a debt “though garnishment 
rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four 
debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR Case 
No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards delinquent tax debts is not 
mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) 
(remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an Internal Revenue Service 
garnishment, “On its face, satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor’s 
garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.”).

card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. 
That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her 
decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had 
been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband 
was inconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that 
AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved 
at the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was issued. The Appeal Board also 
decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the 
absence of evidence5 of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of 
trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked 
the ability to pay her creditors. The Appeal Board noted “it will be a long time at best 
before she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment 
compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a 
circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given 
his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 
(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment 
plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate that plan.” Id. 
The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because it did not 
“articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the Administrative 
Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should have done under 
the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or 
why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light of his limited 
circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) is warranted. Her financial situation 
was damaged by medical debts, underemployment, and support she provided for her 
parents and daughter. She acted responsibly by paying as many debts as possible and 
establishing payment plans for several debts. Although there is limited evidence of record 
                                            
5 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.  
 
 
9 
                                         
 
that she established and maintained contact with her creditors,6 her financial problem is 
being resolved or is under control.      
 
 Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions 
to resolve her debts, establishing some good faith.7 Based on Applicant’s credible and 
sincere promise to pay her debts and her track record of paying her debts, future new 
delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” Applicant assures she will conscientiously 
endeavor to maintain her financial responsibility, and she will be able to apply increases 
in income to resolve her remaining debts. Her efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
                                            
6  “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
7 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 47 years old, and she was employed in human relations and 
administration for a government contractor from October 2007 to November 2014. She 
has enough college credits to be a junior. She has never been married, and she has a 
17-year-old daughter. She provided seven character statements from friends and 
coworkers, and their general sense is that she is diligent, talented, cheerful, helpful, loyal, 
reliable, competent, honest, and professional. There is no evidence of security violations, 
abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs.  
 
The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $37,405, and $29,840 of that total 
consists of four student loans. She paid her student loan debt down to $14,050. The 
student loan creditor is willing to work with Applicant to rehabilitate and discount her 
student loan debt to $11,250. The remaining non-student-loan SOR debt totals $6,900. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial 
cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). She understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She took reasonable actions under her particular financial 
circumstances to address her delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
 
11 
                                         
 
track record” of debt re-payment, and she assures she will maintain her financial 
responsibility once she has the means to do so.8 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.o:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

8 Failure to maintain financial responsibility may raise a security concern. The Government has the 
option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. The Government can re-validate 
Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval 
of a clearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The 
Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light 
of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or 
probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-
03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) 
(stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary security clearance to 
allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her financial problems.”). This 
footnote does not imply that granting Applicant’s security clearance is conditional.
