MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant lost her home to foreclosure because she was unemployed for four years 
after an accident at work in June 2008. Additional medical bills from an illness in late 2013 
also compromised her finances. She disputes all but $370 of some $4,547 in collection 
debt on her credit record, although she presented no documentation to disprove her 
liability. She did not file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 
2015 until April 2017, but she intends to comply with her tax filing obligations in the future. 
She also intends to address the collection debt on her record with the help of an attorney. 
Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On November 7, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was 
unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security 
clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
2 
 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
On December 28, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On April 11, 2017, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On April 19, 2017, I scheduled a hearing for May 25, 
2017. 
 
While this case was pending final adjudication, Security Executive Agent Directive 4 
was issued establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all 
covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AG supersede the adjudicative 
guidelines implemented in September 2006 and are effective for any adjudication made on 
or after June 8, 2017.1 
 
On May 18, 2017, I provided Applicant with an updated version of the Directive 
incorporating the new AG. I advised her that I would be considering the AG in her case, 
given that a decision about her security clearance eligibility would not be forthcoming 
before June 8, 2017. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 25, 2017. Four Government exhibits 
(GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence without objection. A January 23, 2017 letter 
forwarding discovery of the Government’s exhibits to Applicant was marked as a hearing 
exhibit (HE1) but not entered into evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript 
(Tr.) received on June 5, 2017, and submitted a binder of documents, which were marked 
collectively as Applicant exhibit (AE A) and admitted into the record without objection. 
 
I held the record open for post-hearing submissions from Applicant. On May 28, 
2017, Applicant submitted an email and attachments showing her monthly budgets for 
June and July 2017 and some “irregular” expenses (AE B) and a record of her checking 
and savings transactions from May 2017 (AE C). On May 30, 2017, the Government 
indicated that it had no objection, and I accepted AEs B and C into evidence. On June 14, 
2017, Applicant submitted final comments for the record (AE D), which were admitted 
without any objection. The record closed on June 15, 2017, when the Government 
responded to AE D. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file her federal 
and state income tax returns for 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. 1.b) and that her mortgage loan was 
foreclosed in 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Additionally, as of November 7, 2016, she allegedly owed 
                                                 
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in this 
case. 
3 
 
$4,547 in collection debt on 14 accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.q). When she responded to the 
SOR, Applicant admitted her failure to timely file her 2014 tax returns, the foreclosure of 
her mortgage loan, and one collection debt of $250 (SOR ¶ 1.h). She denied the remaining 
debts. 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old high school graduate who has worked as an analyst for a 
defense contractor since May 2015. She earned some college credits between September 
1998 and 2000 but has yet to earn a college degree. Applicant has never married and has 
no children. She seeks her first DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 35, 41.) 
 
Applicant was employed as an executive director with a staffing services company 
from July 2005 to June 2008 and full time as a server at a club from April 2008 to June 
2008. She was severely injured while working as a server in June 2008. She was placed in 
a no-work status pending several surgeries and physical therapy until late May 2012, when 
she was medically cleared for part-time work. Before she was injured, her annual income 
was approximately $42,000 to $45,000. She received a total of $21,681 in temporary total 
disability compensation over the next 204 weeks, which was unevenly disbursed. For some 
14 weeks, she received no payments. Applicant asserts that temporary disability payments 
could be withheld for no reason by her then state of residence. (GEs 1, 4; AE A; Tr. 25-26, 
36-38.) Applicant pursued a legal claim for $66,507 ($21,556 for total permanent disability 
and $44,451 in unpaid temporary total disability compensation). (AE A.) She eventually 
reached a settlement for $55,000 on April 21, 2015. (Tr. 38-39, 74-75.) 
 
During her lengthy unemployment, Applicant relied on savings and financial 
assistance from friends and her church. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) She also liquidated her 401(k) 
assets. (Tr. 27.) She applied under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to 
modify her mortgage loan obtained for $100,000 in 2005. Applicant made her modified 
payments on time during the application process, but had to resubmit her documentation 
several times due to no fault of her own. After she had been advised that her modification 
was approved, she received notice of mortgage foreclosure. Her home loan was foreclosed 
in December 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The deficiency balance on her home loan was paid from 
her mortgage insurance. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 27-28, 52-53.) In August 2013, Applicant 
received $500 in settlement because of the deficient foreclosure process by her lender. 
(AE A; Tr. 27-28.) She received a second settlement in October 2013 from the National 
Mortgage Settlement fund, which was apparently related to the handling of her application 
for modification. (AEs A, D.)  
 
Seven medical debts totaling $3,769 incurred between December 2010 and March 
2011 were assigned for collection in 2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.g, 1.i-1.k). A $28 debt from April 
2010 was placed for collection in August 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.q). (GE 2.) 
 
In June 2012, Applicant resumed working, taking a part-time personal assistant 
position for an investment group. After she was medically cleared for full-time work in 
4 
 
August 2013, Applicant began full-time employment working with a budgeting and 
scheduling tool for a new employer in September 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 80.) She became 
seriously ill in December 2013 and met her medical insurance deductible almost 
immediately. (Tr. 77.) By May 2017, she had had more than six medically necessary 
surgeries or procedures. (AE D.) 
 
In April 2015, Applicant received her disability settlement of $55,000, from which she 
paid her attorney’s fees and expenses of $12,789 and about $3,500 in personal loans. She 
made a $16,322 payment in May 2015 to satisfy the balance of a car loan obtained in 
December 2013 for $21,277. She purchased a computer for her college studies, which she 
resumed early in 2016. She deposited the remainder in her savings account for any 
emergencies. (GE 3; Tr. 39-40, 74-75.) 
 
In May 2015, Applicant resigned and relocated for her present employment with a 
defense contractor. While her new job brought a substantial increase in her annual income 
from her previous $46,000 to her current $68,952, the cost of living in her new locale is 
higher. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41.) 
 
On August 25, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning 
any failure to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes in the past seven years, Applicant 
indicated that she had failed to file returns and pay taxes for 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) 
because she was dealing with health issues at the beginning of 2014 and forgot to request 
an extension before moving in May 2015.2 She indicated that she planned to meet with her 
accountant when she visited her previous locale in September 2015 and would file her 
returns and pay any taxes owed at that time. With regard to any delinquency involving 
enforcement in the last seven years, Applicant disclosed the difficulties paying her 
mortgage loan because of her injury and subsequent lengthy unemployment, and her 
efforts to obtain a modification before she surrendered her home without issue. In an 
optional comment, she indicated that she had only $400 a month to cover her living 
expenses when she was in a non-pay status and that “all areas of [her] financial life were 
negatively affected.” While she did not recall all of the accounts involved, she had disputed 
a telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.p) and a utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.g) in that the creditors 
had billed her for services after she had moved from the home she lost to foreclosure. (GE 
1.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on September 1, 2015, revealed that Applicant had 
settled some credit card accounts that had been delinquent. She was making $95 monthly 
payments on a student loan balance of $7,559, and of $37 and $31 per month on federal 
student loans with balances of $2,731 and $2,328. She had opened a credit card account 
in May 2015, which had a $93 current balance. She was also making payments on terms 
acceptable to the creditor on a credit card with a $22 balance. However, no progress was 
being reported on the medical debts placed for collection in 2011, and a $250 medical debt 
                                                 
2 Applicant testified that she made a misstatement when she said that she forgot to file for an extension of the 
deadline for filing her tax returns for 2014. She had filed for an extension but then did not file her returns by the 
extended deadline. (Tr. 46.) 
5 
 
from January 2014 was in collection (SOR ¶1.h). A telecommunications company had 
placed for collection a $100 debt from June 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.p) in March 2013 and a $102 
debt from February 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.o) in January 2014. (GE 2.) 
 
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) on September 15, 2015. She explained that she would file her 
delinquent income tax returns for tax year 2014 after meeting with her accountant later in 
the month while she was in her previous locale. Applicant also admitted that she could not 
afford to make her $800 monthly mortgage payment after she was injured. She expressed 
awareness of other financial issues but not of the specifics. When confronted about the 
delinquencies on her credit record, Applicant did not recognize the medical collection debts 
but indicated she would look into them. She described her current financial situation as 
good and improving. (GE 4.) 
 
As of August 10, 2016, Equifax was reporting seven collection debts on her record: 
$250 (SOR ¶ 1.h), $120 from August 2015 (medical, SOR ¶ 1.l), $81 from December 2014 
(medical, SOR ¶ 1.m), $97 from January 2014 (medical, SOR ¶ 1.n), $102 (SOR ¶ 1.o), 
$100 (SOR ¶ 1.p) and $28 (SOR ¶ 1.q). No other delinquencies were on her credit record. 
(GE 3.) 
 
Applicant has been unable to verify the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f, 1.i-1.k, 1.m-
1.n, and 1.q, and she does not want to pay any debts that are not legitimate. She did not 
contact the collection entities identified in the SOR, but instead she tried to match the 
amounts with her bills and contacted some of her medical providers. (Tr. 54, 62.) When 
asked why she did not contact the collection entities, she responded: “In my experience, 
their objective is to collect money, and they’re not concerned with the facts.” The debts did 
not appear on a report generated by the credit monitoring service that she uses. (Tr. 54.) 
Applicant believes the $120 medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.l) is for a medical 
procedure she incurred in her new locale. Applicant has been paying what she can afford, 
approximately $150 a month, toward newer medical debts, including a large hospital bill 
that she believes includes the $120 medical debt.3 (AE A; Tr. 57-59.) After paying 
approximately $4,690 in medical expenses in the past year, she owes approximately 
$1,400 in medical debt. (Tr. 60.) She expressed her intention to pay those debts that are 
proven to be valid and plans to hire an attorney to assist in the debt validation. (Tr. 56.) 
 
Applicant disputed the $374 debt, which she claims is for utility services (SOR ¶ 1.g) 
and the $102 telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.o), which she believes is duplicated in 
SOR ¶ 1.p because the services should have been disconnected at the foreclosure. When 
Applicant vacated, she opted to have her land line number transferred to her cell phone, 
and the company failed to turn off the landline after the number was transferred. Applicant 
has been told that she will not be pursued for the debt because of the company’s error. (Tr. 
29-31.) 
                                                 
3 Applicant testified that she is paying an average of $340 a month toward the medical debts incurred since 
she relocated. (Tr. 56-57.) After her personal appearance, she submitted her monthly budgets for June and 
July 2017 which show monthly planned payments of $150 to her medical bills. About $190 was going to her 
private student loan. (AE B.) 
6 
 
Applicant filed her tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 with her 2016 returns in 
April 2017. When asked about the delay in filing her returns for 2014, Applicant responded, 
that she had been unable to meet with her accountant as she had planned, and she 
attempted to prepare the returns on her own. She knew she did not owe any taxes. It was a 
matter of gathering her documentation for her deductions. She withheld her income tax 
return for 2015 in 2016 because she incorrectly believed she needed to file her delinquent 
return for 2014 before she could file for 2015. (Tr. 46-48.) She owed no federal or state 
taxes as of May 2017. (Tr. 63.) Applicant intends to comply with tax-filing deadlines in the 
future. (Tr. 86-87.) 
 
Applicant maintains a monthly budget according to a budget-management class she 
took in 2016. Her budget fully accounts for her income each month. She takes home $902 
per week on an annual salary of $68,952. (Tr. 40.) Her rent is $1,618. Utilities, such as 
water, natural gas, electricity, telephone, and Internet total approximately $200 to $215 a 
month. About $200 of her income is spent on groceries. She budgets $100 per month for 
miscellaneous expenses. Her payments for student loans and medical debts average $340 
per month. She maintains a “combined fund” containing $500 to $1,000 for other 
expenses, such as property tax, auto maintenance, personal hygiene, clothing, pet care, 
renter’s insurance, and automobile insurance. (AE B.) She focuses on paying off open 
balances, starting with the smallest, with funds available after paying her monthly 
expenses. (AE B; Tr. 69-70, 73.) She recently deferred her federal student loan. (Tr. 42, 
70.) She continues to make monthly payments on her private student loans. (Tr. 43.) Once 
her student loans are paid off, she plans to save enough to cover six months of expenses. 
(AE B.) As of May 26, 2017, Applicant had $4,138 in total checking and savings deposits. 
(AE C.) 
 
Work Performance and References 
 
 Applicant has met, and in some aspects of her work performance, exceeded 
targeted objectives in her current position. She displayed competence in her duties and 
was given a summary rating of “progressing” on her annual performance review in 2015. In 
2016, Applicant was rated as “above target” in providing benefits to her customers and 
meeting key performance metrics. She received expert ratings from her supervisor in two 
of five competencies, i.e., developing talent and customer focus. Her overall performance 
was rated as exceptional. (AE A.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
7 
 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated 
by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security 
concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance 
misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by 
8 
 
known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result 
from criminal activity, including espionage. 
 
 The Government met its burden of establishing a prima facie case for 
disqualification. Applicant did not timely file her federal and state income tax returns for 
2014 or 2015. Her failure to comply with her income tax filing obligation for 2015 was not 
alleged in the SOR, but it is relevant in assessing reform of her noncompliance for tax year 
2014.4  As alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, she lost her home to foreclosure of her mortgage loan. 
Available credit reports also reflect some $4,547 in outstanding collection balances on her 
credit record, but Applicant admits her liability for only two recent medical debts of $250 
(SOR ¶ 1.h) and $120 (SOR 1.l). 
 
 The burden is on the Government of proving matters that are controverted. See 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14. The Appeal Board has held that adverse information from a credit 
report is normally sufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard to establish a debt. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Applicant presented no 
corroborating documentation proving that the $374 debt in SOR ¶ 1.g and that the $100 
telephone debt in SOR ¶ 1.p were for services assessed after she had moved from her 
foreclosed home. Available credit information shows the account in SOR ¶ 1.g to be a 
medical debt placed for collection in January 2010. The telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 
1.o is from June 2011, so it could well be explained by the creditor’s mistake regarding the 
landline account for the foreclosed home. 
 
 Concerning the disputed medical debts held by the collection entity identified in SOR 
¶¶ 1.d-1.f and 1.k, Applicant did not contact the collection entity, but she could not match 
up her medical bills with any of the debts. However, the same collection entity also holds 
an undisputed $250 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) assigned in September 2014. Under the 
circumstances, it is difficult to understand why she did not contact the collection entity in an 
effort to determine the legitimacy of the older medical debts, which no longer appear on her 
credit record as reported by Equifax. Given Applicant’s significant and ongoing medical 
issues since 2008, she could well have incurred medical debt for which she does not 
currently have any records. Medical billing records of her past care could perhaps raise 
legitimate questions about the validity of the debts, but none were produced. Based on the 
record evidence before me, I find that three disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19 apply in 
this case: 19(a), “inability to satisfy debts;” 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations;” and 19(f), “failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
 
 Applicant has the burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by the collection 
debts, mortgage foreclosure, and her noncompliance with her income tax filing obligation. 
                                                 
4 The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). 
9 
 
Under the AG effective for any adjudication on or after June 8, 2017, a record of consumer 
and tax delinquency may be mitigated under one or more of the following conditions under 
¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a 
legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, 
and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) has some applicability to the mortgage foreclosure, which occurred more 
than five years ago. Her noncompliance with her income tax return filing obligation is too 
recent for mitigation under AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s 2014 income tax returns were due in 
October 2015, assuming that she filed for an extension of the filing deadline as she now 
asserts. On her August 2015 SF 86 and during her September 15, 2015 interview, 
Applicant indicated that she would be traveling to her previous locale in September 2015 
and meeting with her accountant about filing her returns. She testified at her hearing that 
the timing did not work out and she did not meet with her accountant. Instead, she worked 
on the tax returns herself and filed both her 2014 and 2015 tax returns with her 2016 tax 
returns in April 2017. Her inattention to her income tax filing obligation for tax year 2014 
from October 2015 to April 2017 constitutes continuing conduct over that time that raises 
concerns about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Moreover, medical debts 
continue to be placed for collection. The medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.n were 
referred for collection in March 2016, July 2015, and August 2015, respectively. Applicant 
does not now dispute the $120 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.l), although she assets that it is 
10 
 
“embedded” in the hospital debt that she is repaying. When she answered the SOR, she 
acknowledged the $250 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.h), which was placed for collection in 
September 2014. AG ¶ 20(a) does not mitigate such recent delinquency. 
 
 Applicant has shown some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). Her unforeseen work injury 
in June 2008 without medical clearance to work before late May 2012 is a circumstance 
contemplated within AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant lacked any control over disability payments that 
were withheld, and when she did receive payments, they were not sufficient to cover all of 
her expenses, including her mortgage. Applicant acted responsibly by attempting to modify 
her home loan, but her lender was deficient in handling her modification and foreclosure. 
By the time she received settlements for her lender’s deficient handling of her mortgage 
modification and the foreclosure proceedings, she had already lost her home. The 
foreclosure on her home does not raise current security concerns, given the deficient 
handling of her modification request. AG ¶ 20(b) also has some applicability to the 
collection debts that were incurred when she was unemployed, such as the seven medical 
debts totaling $3,769 that were incurred between December 2010 and March 2011 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.d-1.g, 1.i-1.k), the $28 debt from April 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.q), and the $100 
telecommunications debt from June 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.p). 
 
 Applicant has made little to no progress on resolving her old medical debts despite 
her return to full-time employment in September 2013 at a salary of $42,000 to $45,000 a 
year. However, she suffered a serious medical illness in December 2013 which continues 
to impact her financially because of new medical debt. After paying approximately $4,690 
in medical co-payments over the past year, she owes $1,400 in recent medical debt. It is 
understandable that Applicant would give priority to her newer medical debt to ensure a 
continuation of her present care. Given the extent of her medical debt, Applicant could 
conceivably overlook a few medical bills. She was unaware of the old medical debt when 
she decided to pay off her car loan with her temporary disability settlement in May 2015. 
 
 Nonetheless, Applicant could have done more to address her old medical debts. 
She indicated during her September 2015 interview that she would investigate the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.k and 1.o-1.q to determine their status. She testified that she had 
no success matching the debt information with her medical bills, and also that she 
contacted some of her medical providers, who had no record of the debt(s). Her more 
recent medical collection debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.n) are identified in the SOR only by account 
number, which could make it difficult to locate them if the account does not match her 
records. Yet, several of her older medical debts are reportedly in collection with the same 
entity that holds the undisputed $250 debt (SOR ¶ 1.h), which remains unpaid. Her 
explanation for not contacting the collection entity—that its primary objective is to collect 
money without regard to the facts—is speculation not supported by any evidence. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) and AG ¶ 20(d) has some applicability to the mortgage loan in that the 
deficiency balance on the loan was covered by her mortgage insurance, and she attempted 
a modification in good faith before the loan was foreclosed. Her tax issues have also been 
resolved with the filing of her delinquent tax returns for 2014 and 2015 in April 2017. She 
has expressed an intention to comply with her tax-filing obligation in the future. Neither AG 
11 
 
¶ 20(c) nor AG ¶ 20(d) has been fully satisfied with respect to the medical collection debts 
with the possible exception of the $120 debt (SOR ¶ 1.l), which Applicant indicates is 
embedded in the hospital charges that she has been repaying. Applicant testified that none 
of the amounts appeared on her credit report obtained from the credit monitoring service 
that she uses. Nevertheless, it is noted that debts may be dropped from a credit record for 
various reasons, such as the passage of time or the failure of a creditor to timely respond 
to the request of the credit reporting company for information, and removal of a debt from a 
credit report does not necessarily disprove the debt’s validity. Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681c, 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a 
credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection 
barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is later. There is also no 
substantiating evidence that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($102) is a duplicate listing of the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.p ($100). While the collection entity and the original creditor are the same, the 
account numbers differ. 
 
 Concerning her delinquent federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014, 
AG ¶ 20(g) applies in that her delinquent returns have been filed. Even where tax problems 
have been corrected, and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems in the future, 
the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant’s trustworthiness in 
light of prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant’s delay in filing her income tax returns for tax year 
2014 was because of her failure to gather necessary paperwork for deductions, which was 
within her control, although there is no evidence that she failed to timely file her income tax 
returns when she lived in her previous locale and had the assistance of an accountant. The 
timing of her income tax filings for 2014 and 2015 suggests that her compliance was 
prompted by the issuance of the SOR. Nonetheless, it is somewhat mitigating that her non-
filing was limited to two years. 
 
 As for her failure to address most of her medical collection debt, the security 
clearance adjudication is not aimed at collecting an applicant’s personal debts. Rather, it 
involves an evaluation of an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of 
the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 
2010). In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established that an applicant 
is not required to pay off every debt in the SOR: 
 
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track 
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not require, as a matter of law, to 
establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that 
is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to 
resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that 
plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s 
financial situation and evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There 
is no requirement that the plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
12 
 
provide for the payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Based on Appeal Board precedent, Applicant is not required to 
pay off her SOR debts if she is handling her finances in a manner that shows sound 
judgment. She presented evidence showing that she is paying approximately $150 per 
month toward her newer medical debts. Her line items in her budget are reasonable and do 
not reflect any extravagant spending. She appears to have her spending in control, and 
she lives within her means. She owes less than $5,000 in delinquent debt so it is not likely 
to be a source of financial pressure based on her current income of $68,952. 
 
 Applicant expressed an intention to retain the services of an attorney to assist her in 
investigating the past-due balances on her credit record. Certainly, she would have a much 
stronger case in mitigation had she done so before her hearing. A promise to pay a 
delinquent debt in the future, no matter how sincerely made, is not a substitute for having 
paid the debt. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). Nonetheless, 
she has taken reasonable steps to stabilize her finances that weigh in her favor. She is 
seen as likely to make payments toward verified financial obligations. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
In assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of 
an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(d).5 The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
It is understandable that some debts went to collections in light of Applicant’s 
unemployment for some four years. Her debt is largely medical, and nondiscretionary 
medical debt is not viewed as negatively as had Applicant taken on credit card or loan debt 
beyond her ability to repay. A person rarely chooses to incur significant medical debt, and it 
is often not planned for in a person’s budget. Applicant has given priority to stabilizing her 
finances over correcting the adverse credit information on her record, even to the extent of 
replenishing her emergency fund over ensuring that all of her medical debts are being 
repaid. Yet, given her financial struggles during her lengthy unemployment, her desire to 
ensure that she has some cash on hand for an emergency is understandable. Her belated 
                                                 
5 The factors under AG ¶ 2(d) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
13 
 
compliance with her income tax filing obligations for 2014 and 2015 generates some 
concern, but it appears to have been situational and not likely to be repeated, now that she 
understands the importance of filing on time whether or not she is owed a refund. 
 
While there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance when there are issues of some security concern,6 Applicant’s performance 
evaluations show that she has been a valued contributor at work. She was given the 
highest overall rating for her performance for 2016. Her good work record weighs in her 
favor. The evidence of her consistent medical payments over the past year and the 
relatively small amount yet to be addressed suggests that she can be counted on to 
address her unresolved financial issues. After considering the whole-person concept, I 
conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security 
clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.q:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
