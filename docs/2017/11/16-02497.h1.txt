HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
On December 22, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the 
DOD after September 1, 2006. The AGs implemented on September 1, 2006, have 
been superceded by AGs implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  The June 8, 2017 
AGs will be used to decide this case. If the September 1, 2006 AGs were applied, the 
outcome of this case would be the same.   
  
 On January 13, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on 
the record. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 
7, 2017. Applicant received the FORM on February 10, 2017. Applicant had 30 days to 
submit a response to the FORM. He did not submit a response to the FORM. On April 
3, 2017, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to me on October 
1, 2017. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied.

Findings of Fact 
  
 Applicant is an employee of a DOD contractor seeking a security clearance. He 
has been employed with his current employer since September 2015. He has a high 
school diploma and some college credit. He is divorced and has a 21-year-old daughter.  
He served two periods of active duty in the United States Army from April 2000 to April 
2004, and June 2010 to August 2014. He received an Honorable discharge after both 
periods of active duty service. He has been granted a security clearance in the past. 
(Item 3) 
 
On October 20, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (Item 3) He disclosed numerous delinquent accounts, 
including the following accounts alleged in the SOR:  a $14,101 car loan that was 
charged off in May 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 4 at 3: Item 5 at 1); a $6,809 car loan account 
that was charged off in February 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Item 4 at 3: Item 5 at 2); a $6,263 
debt resulting from a car repossession in April 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 4 at 7: Item 5 at 
2); three delinquent student loan accounts placed for collection in the amounts of 
$1,069; $535; and $244 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f:  Item 4 at 3: Item 5 at 2); a $1,105 
debt placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.g: Item 4 at 4) a $4,375 debt placed for collection in 
October 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Item 4 at 14), and a $135 medical account placed for 
collection in May 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.i: Item 4 at 14). The total amount of the delinquent 
debt is $34,636.  
 
Applicant listed on his e-QIP application that he was unemployed between  
August 2014 and September 2015, and between April 2004 to June 2004. In the 
additional comments section at the end of the application, Applicant states: 
 
As far as my financial record, this has happened over a period of time. I 
was married with a growing family on one pay check in the army. We tried 
our best to keep things balanced but things got behind. I have been 
struggling trying to find employ since getting out of the army in 2014. I 
have been homeless two times or living with friends. Now that I have this 
job I currently making plans and starting on clearing my debt. This will take 
time but I will do what I can to get back in good standing.   
 
 In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all allegations in SOR without 
additional explanations. He did not respond to the FORM. Applicant did not provide any 
information about whether he had a plan in place to resolve his delinquent debts. He 
provided no receipts indicating whether any respective debts were paid and no 
evidence of payment plans with any of the creditors alleged in the SOR. He did not 
provide information on his financial status, such as a monthly budget which shows his  
monthly income and monthly expenses. There is no indication that he attended financial 
counseling.

Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and 
mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access 
to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national 
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
GUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. 
The disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant’s case include: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
All of the above disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant incurred nine 
delinquent accounts with an approximate total of $34,636.   
 
An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving 
irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in 
other aspects of life. A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until 
evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under 
agreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk 
inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial 
obligations.  
 
The concern under Financial Considerations is broader than the possibility that a 
person might knowingly compromise classified information to obtain money or 
 
5 
 
 
something else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, 
judgment, and other important qualities.  
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s admissions raised 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive ¶ 
E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  
 
AG ¶ 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
financial counseling service, and there are clear indications the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; and   
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because Applicant was unemployed for a year before 
starting his current job in September 2015. I do not have enough information to 
conclude that Applicant behaved responsibly under the circumstances so this mitigating 
condition is given less weight.   
 
None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. Applicant acknowledges his 
financial problems, but has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his 
delinquent debts. If Applicant develops of plan to pay his delinquent debts, attends 
financial counseling, and follows a budget, he may mitigate the concerns raised under 
financial considerations. At this time, he has not met his burden of proof to mitigate the 
security concerns.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
 I considered Applicant’s work for a DoD contractor since September 2015.  I 
considered Applicant’s honorable service in the United States Army. I considered his 
truthfulness in disclosing his debts on his e-QIP application. However, he did not 
provide proof that he was actively taking steps to resolve his delinquent accounts now 
that he was employed full-time. The security concerns raised under financial 
considerations are not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.i:    Against Applicant 
 
     Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
