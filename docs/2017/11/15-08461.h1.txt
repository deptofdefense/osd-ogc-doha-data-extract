MOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 29, 2016, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 
5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DoD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F and J.1 (Item 1.) 
The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the 
government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security 
clearance. 
 
 On December 8, 2016, Applicant submitted a written reply to the SOR (RSOR) 
with attachments, and he requested that his case be decided on the written record in 
lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)  On January 26, 2016, Department Counsel issued the 
                                                          
1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new 
Adjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was 
considered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006. 
 
2 
 
Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant. In the FORM, Department Counsel offered five documentary 
exhibits. (Items 1-5.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit 
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on March 3, 2017. 
Applicant submitted no additional documents into evidence. The case was assigned to 
this Administrative Judge on October 1, 2017. Based upon a review of the pleadings 
and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and exhibits, I make the 
following findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is 54 years old, and he is married. He is a high school graduate. 
Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance 
in connection with his employment in the defense sector. (Item 3.) 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
 
 The SOR lists six allegations (1.a. through 1.f.) regarding financial difficulties, 
specifically overdue debts, under Adjudicative Guideline F. The delinquent debts total 
approximately $13,000. All of the SOR allegations were established by Item 4, and they 
will be discussed below in the order they were listed on the SOR: 
 
1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a delinquent account in the amount 
of $184. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR. He wrote that he contacted 
this creditor and was told it was paid off on October 9, 2014. (Item 2.) No independent 
evidence was introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or reduced.  
 
1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a delinquent account in the amount 
of $1,103. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR. He wrote that he 
contacted this creditor and was told it was paid off in June 2016. (Item 2.) No 
independent evidence was introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or 
reduced. 
   
1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a delinquent account in the amount 
of $6,257. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR. He wrote that this debt 
remains unpaid, but he is making monthly payments. (Item 2.) No independent evidence 
was introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or reduced. 
   
1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a delinquent account in the amount 
of $1,091. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR. He wrote that this debt 
remains unpaid, but he is making monthly payments. (Item 2.) No independent evidence 
was introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or reduced. 
          
1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a delinquent account in the amount 
of $617. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR, and he wrote that this debt 
 
3 
 
remains unpaid, but he also wrote that he contacted the creditor and was told that this 
debt was paid. (Item 2.) No independent evidence was introduced to establish that this 
debt has been resolved or reduced. 
 
1.f. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant wages were garnished in November 
2012 in the approximate amount of $3,900 to satisfy a debt to the creditor listed on 1.e., 
above.  (Item 1.) Applicant admitted that his wages were garnished to pay off the debt, 
and when he contacted the creditor he was told the debt had been paid. (Item 2.)   
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct  
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts, which create doubt 
about his judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness. The SOR lists one allegations 
(2.a.) regarding criminal conduct, under Adjudicative Guideline J.  
 
2.a. It is alleged in the SOR that in September 2014, Applicant was arrested and 
charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). Applicant plead guilty in December 
2014. He was ordered to attend DUI classes, and Alcoholics Anonymous for three 
months, and his driver’s license was restricted for six months. Applicant was also placed 
on five year summary probation, which does not end until December 2019. (Item 1.) 
Applicant admitted his DUI on his RSOR, and he wrote that he completed all of his 
classes and now he only drinks occasionally at home or at private parties, but he does 
not drink and drive. (Item 2.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record.  
 
 
4 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall 
be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage.  
 
  The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Applicant had many delinquent debts for several years. The evidence is 
sufficient to raise disqualifying conditions (a) and (c) as potentially applicable in this 
case:   
 
 
5 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing 
deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators; 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required; 
 
(g) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, 
increase in net worth, or money transfers that are inconsistent with known 
legal sources of income; 
 
(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to 
fund gambling or pay gambling debts; and 
 
(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused 
by gambling.  
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered 
all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 including: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
6 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Because no independent evidence has been introduced to establish the cause of 
Applicant's delinquent debt, or to show that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve or 
reduce this debt, I do not find that any of the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 20 have 
been established. Therefore, I find against Applicant under Guideline F. 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 30: 
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
 AG ¶ 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) evidence . . .  of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual 
was formally charges, prosecuted or convicted; and  
 
(b) individual is currently on parole or probation.  
 
Applicant was arrested for DUI as recently as September 2014 and convicted in 
December 2014. He remains on probation until December 2019. This offense gives rise 
to concerns about Applicant’s judgment and reliability, because of the nature of the 
criminal offenses. The aforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established.  
 
Because Applicant is still under probation for the criminal conduct that occurred 
in 2014, and he has not submitted any independent evidence to establish that he has 
demonstrated compliance with the court ordered requirements of this conviction, I do 
not find that any Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions are applicable under AG ¶ 32. 
 
7 
 
Applicant’s criminal past continues to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment. I, 
therefore, find Guideline J against Applicant. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations and Criminal 
Conduct security concerns under the whole-person concept.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.-1.f.:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a.:    Against Applicant 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
