MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 3, 2016. On 
January 26, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006 (2006 AG). 
 
On February 22, 2017 and March 21, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed on April 11, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on May 3, 2017. On July 
10, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that 
the hearing was scheduled for August 10, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record a letter the Government sent to Applicant as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through F, which I 
admitted, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open to August 18, 
2017. Applicant timely provided additional documents which I admitted as AE G and H, 
without objection.1 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 17, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG (2017 AG).2 Accordingly, I have 
applied the 2017 AG.3 However, I have also considered the 2006 AG, because they 
were in effect on the date the SOR was issued. I conclude that my decision would have 
been the same under either version. 
 
Findings of Fact4 
 
Applicant, age 55, married his wife in 1982. He has three adult children. He 
received an associate’s degree in 1982, and a bachelor’s degree in 1985. He has been 
employed full time by the same defense contractor since 1999. This is his first 
application for a security clearance.5 
 
Applicant obtained four student loans for his children in 2003 and 2004, totaling 
approximately $74,256.6 Applicant chose to repay the loans via a graduated repayment 
schedule, which provided a lower initial monthly payment that gradually increased over 
time until it reached the full repayment amount. For reasons not specified in the record, 
Applicant claimed that he had trouble paying the increased amount in approximately 
                                                          
1 I initially advised the parties that these two documents would be admitted as AE G and HE II. I, sua 
sponte, admitted both documents as exhibits, AE G and H, after further considering the nature of certain 
information contained in HE II. 
 
2 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD 4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD 4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD 4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD 4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD 4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information. (SEAD 4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards).

Applicant’s SOR Answer, his SCA (GE 1), and the summary of his August 2015 background-investigation 
interview (GE 2).

late 2005 or early 2006. After the lenders refused to renegotiate the terms of the loan or 
accept partial payments, he eventually defaulted on the loans.7  
 
A state and a federal agency filed garnishments between 2007 and 2013 against 
Applicant’s wages to collect their respective portions of the defaulted loans. The state 
agency reported a $42,024 balance owed in 2007 and $48,872 in 2013. The federal 
agency reported a $49,489 balance owed in 2008. By June 2016, two of the loans were 
in collection status with the federal agency in the amount of $47,608 (SOR ¶ 1.a / 
federal debt), and the other two were in collection status with the state agency in the 
amount of $27,090 (SOR ¶ 1.b / state debt).8  
 
While Applicant acknowledged that they were not the ideal methods to resolve 
his defaulted loans, he believed the involuntary wage garnishments were the best way 
to ensure that they were paid. Therefore, he never disputed them and assumed that 
both the federal and state debts were being paid accordingly. Prior to early 2017, 
Applicant had not been in contact with either lender since the garnishments were 
issued, except for monthly statements he received about the state debt that reflected a 
reduced balance over time. He has never received any documents about the federal 
debt, nor has he ever inquired of his employer about where the garnishments were 
being sent. By July 2017, garnishments had reduced the balance of the state debt to 
$14,809.9  
 
From approximately 2013 or 2014 through early 2017, Applicant had two wage 
garnishments deducted from his paycheck totaling approximately $750 bi-weekly, which 
he assumed was paying both the federal and state debts. For reasons unknown to 
Applicant, one of the two garnishments stopped in early 2017, leaving only one $443 bi-
weekly deduction. Assuming it was the federal agency’s garnishment that stopped, he 
contacted them. He then learned that the federal debt had not been paid via 
garnishment or otherwise, and that the federal agency had assigned it to a collection 
agency. Applicant attempted to contact that collection agency once in early 2017, a few 
days before the hearing, and at least once after the hearing. On each occasion, his call 
was answered by a recording advising of a temporary restraining order issued against it 
by a U.S. Court of Claims judge that generally prohibited contact with debtors, not 
specifically with Applicant.10 He estimated that the balance of the federal debt was 
$61,813, as of August 2017.11

During the course of the 17 years that Applicant has worked for his current 
employer, his annual salary has increased from $45,000 to $98,550.12 He had a second 
part-time job from 2002 through 2014, for which he received approximately $150 to 
$300 per year. He has never received financial counseling. Aside from his student loan 
debts, he has managed his finances responsibly, including in 2015 and 2016 when he 
incurred extraordinary medical expenses. He uses a spreadsheet to manage his 
expenses, and currently operates with a monthly surplus of $415 by living in the same 
modest home for 30 years, using credit cards wisely, and not spending extravagantly. 
He has identified several discretionary expenses in his budget that he could eliminate to 
meet his expenses should it become necessary.13  
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”14 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”15 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”16 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.

Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”17 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.18 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”19 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.20 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.21 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.22 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”23 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”24 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental

health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . 
 
 Applicant’s defaulted student loans establish two disqualifying conditions under 
this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations).  
 
 The following are the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this 
guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant defaulted on the student loans as early 
as 2006. While his state debt has been considerably reduced through involuntary wage 
garnishments, Applicant’s substantial federal debt remains unresolved.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant failed to meet his burden to establish 
that the student loan debts were caused by circumstances largely beyond his control. 
However, even if he had, he has not acted responsibly to resolve the federal debt.  
 
AG 20 (d) is not established. I credit Applicant with making partial payments to 
his creditors immediately following the graduated payment increases. While involuntary 
garnishment payments do not suffice to establish good-faith efforts, I credit him with 
complying with those payments over an extended number of years, resulting in his state 
debt being signficantly reduced. I considered that Applicant believed that his federal 
debt was also being satisfied through involuntary wage garnishments until he learned 
otherwise in early 2017. I also considered that he discovered in early 2017 that the 
federal debt was being handled by a collection agency, with which he has been unable 
to make direct contact, despite his efforts. However, not only has the 2008 wage 
garnishment issued by the federal agency remained unsatisfied, there is no evidence 
that it was ever paid, even in part. Therefore, I cannot conclude that Applicant has 
demonstrated sufficient good-faith effort to resolve the federal debt. 
 
7 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his federal student loan debt. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried 
his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is denied.
