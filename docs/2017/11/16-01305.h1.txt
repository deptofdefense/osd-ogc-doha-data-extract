GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct 
security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 6, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on October 30, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 
7, 2017, scheduling the hearing for September 1, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. 
 
2 
 
 The Government amended the SOR, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive, to 
add an allegation numbered SOR ¶ 2.a under Guideline J (criminal conduct). The 
Government’s discovery letter, letter notifying Applicant of its amendment to the SOR, 
amendment to the SOR, exhibit list, and file of relevant material were appended to the 
record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1-5, respectively. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through G, which were admitted in evidence without 
objection.                                                                                                                                                  
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until September 22, 2017, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
Applicant timely provided additional evidence, which I marked collectively as AE H and 
admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
September 12, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j and denied SOR ¶ 2.a.  
He is 51 years old. He was born in Afghanistan, immigrated to the United States in April 
1989, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1996. He received his high-
school diploma and attended two years of college, but did not earn a degree. He has 
received numerous vendor certificates. He is married, and he has four children, ages 
18, 16, 15, and 14.1  
 
 Applicant has worked in various positions with the same defense contractor since 
2003. He has worked in his current position as a linguist recruiter since May 2017. He 
was deployed overseas with his company from September 2008 to September 2013, 
June 2015 to December 2016, and November 2016 to April 2017. He has held a DOD 
security clearance since 2007.2  
 
 The SOR alleges a judgment entered against Applicant in 2015 for $1,067; a 
federal tax lien entered against Applicant in 2015 for $8,571; and eight delinquent 
consumer accounts totaling $85,775. It also alleges that Applicant was arrested and 
charged in July 2017 with felony domestic assault and two counts of misdemeanor 
domestic assault; and that the charges were pending as of the date of the SOR.  
 
 The financial SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions and 
credit reports from June 2015, November 2015, July 2016, and December 2016. 
Applicant also disclosed his debts on his May 2015 security clearance application and 
discussed them in his March 2016 response to interrogatories. The criminal allegation is 
established by a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) incident history report, in

which Applicant self-reported his arrest to his security office in July 2017, 
documentation provided by Applicant, and Applicant’s testimony.3  
 
 Applicant attributes his debts to his family’s involvement in a serious car accident 
in September 2013 while he was deployed overseas, a result of which he left his job on 
emergency status, returned to the United States, and was unemployed for three 
months. His wife, who worked as a county bus attendant prior to the accident, was 
consequently unemployed for nine months. Though most of the medical expenses 
incurred as a result of the injuries sustained by his wife and children from the accident 
were covered by health insurance, Applicant was responsible for and paid $11,000 in 
medical costs. Applicant worked as a recruiter from December 2013 to February 2015, 
but he earned a limited income of $60,000 annually, having previously earned $11,000 
to $16,000 monthly while he was deployed between 2003 and 2013. He supplemented 
his income with minimal earnings he made from working as an Uber driver. As a result, 
from September 2013 to February 2015, Applicant supported himself and his family 
primarily with credit cards and income he had earned prior to the accident.4  
 
 Between February and March 2015, Applicant was again unable to work due to 
health issues, though he occasionally also drove an Uber during this period. Between 
June 2015 and April 2017, Applicant deployed overseas with his employer and earned 
$11,000 monthly. He intended to use the $18,000 in settlement money given to his wife 
in her suit against the other driver who was determined to be at fault for the accident, 
but his wife spent the money before he returned from deployment. In April 2017, 
Applicant suffered a heart attack while on duty during deployment, and he was 
consequently medevacked to a location where he was hospitalized for seven days 
before he was sent home. Applicant was responsible for and paid $3,500 in medical 
costs as a result of his heart attack. He was unemployed from April to May 2017. Since 
May 2017, he has worked as a recruiter but again earns a limited income of $60,000 
annually; his wife earned $1,900 monthly, a $200 raise from her monthly income prior to 
the accident.5  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a is a $1,607 judgment to a hotel and casino entered against Applicant 
in October 2015. During his visits home for vacation from deployment between 2008 
and 2013, Applicant accompanied his uncle on various occasions to a hotel and casino 
so that his uncle could gamble. Applicant also gambled on occasion. In 2014, Applicant 
opened a $1,500 line of credit at his uncle’s request. Applicant expected his uncle to 
pay the debt. When he learned of the judgment in 2016, Applicant testified that he sent 
the related documentation to his uncle so that his uncle could pay the judgment. He last 
spoke to his uncle three weeks prior to the hearing, and his uncle told him that he would 
pay the judgment as soon as he is recovered from a medical emergency.6

 SOR ¶ 1.b is a federal tax lien of $8,561 filed against Applicant in 2015 for 
unpaid 2012 federal taxes. Applicant stated he is responsible for paying his taxes as a 
contractor, and in 2012, his family spent the money he allocated to pay his taxes. The 
IRS letter concerning the debt that was sent to his house while he was deployed was 
neglected by his wife and children. Upon receiving an email from the IRS, he made a 
payment arrangement of $250 monthly in October 2015. He made payments in 
accordance with the plan until April 2017, and the IRS also applied his tax refunds from 
2015 and 2016 towards the lien. Applicant provided an August 2016 letter from the IRS 
reflecting Applicant’s installment agreement of $250 monthly, and an outstanding 
balance of $4,208 for his 2012 taxes. He also provided a June 2017 notice from the IRS 
indicating that he had a $3,072 overpayment from his 2016 federal taxes, of which 
$1,579 was applied to his outstanding 2012 taxes, and $1,492 of which was due to him 
as a refund. I find that Applicant resolved SOR ¶ 1.b.7 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.c is for a contract termination fee when Applicant switched from one 
telephone provider to another. He telephonically disputed the amount owed because he 
thought the new provider would pay the termination fee, but he was unaware of the 
result of his dispute because he was deployed. He acknowledged that he received 
correspondence from a collection agency, and he intended to verify the debt. As of the 
hearing date, he had not contacted the telephone provider, nor had he communicated 
with the collection agency.8 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.d is for a debt incurred with another telephone provider for a phone line 
Applicant obtained in 2014. Applicant’s family incurred this debt while he was deployed. 
He sent letters to the telephone provider in late 2016, but he was unaware whether the 
provider responded because he was deployed.9 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.e is for a credit card Applicant used during his periods of 
unemployment. It became delinquent because he did not have the money to pay it. As 
of the hearing date, Applicant was negotiating with a third party who held the account.10 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f is for a credit card debt that was sold to an attorney for a collection 
agency. Applicant believed that the collection agency obtained a judgment against him 
while he was deployed between 2015 and 2016, as it garnished $2,700 from his bank 
account. His wife reached a payment arrangement with the creditor, and he believed 
this debt was paid. He provided a March 2016 payment receipt and a December 2016 
letter from the attorney for the collection agency, reflecting that Applicant made 
payments of $100 and $300, respectively. Applicant noted on the December 2016 letter

that he made installment payments in accordance with the payment arrangement, and 
the debt was paid. He did not provide documentation to show that this debt was paid.11  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g is for a credit card Applicant used to support his family after the 
accident. Applicant testified that it was sold to a third party, who then sold it to another 
party. He was in the process of trying to reach the creditor that currently holds the debt 
so that he can settle it.12  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h is a store account. Applicant testified that he paid this account before 
he deployed. He corresponded with the store in 2016. He testified that he needs to 
investigate further to determine who incurred the charges and to verify the debt.13  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i is the mortgage account for the home Applicant purchased in October 
2011. He became delinquent on his mortgage after the accident. He obtained a loan 
modification at the end of 2014, the terms of which were remodified in late June 2015. 
Since then, he paid $2,600 monthly in compliance with the modified loan. As of the 
hearing date, he was one month delinquent on his mortgage because he incurred legal 
fees after his arrest in July 2017; he expected to bring his mortgage current by October 
2017. Applicant provided documentation reflecting that he requested a loan modification 
due to hardship in July 2015, and the creditor approved his request in June 2016; the 
total delinquent amount of $49,016 was added to his loan balance; and the new 
modified principal balance was $348,846. The December 2016 credit report reflects that 
this account is current. I find that Applicant resolved SOR ¶ 1.i.14  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j is for a credit card. Applicant testified that he neglected this debt and 
intended to pay it.15   
 
Applicant testified that his wife previously managed their finances because of his 
deployments, but he has taken on the responsibility of paying their bills. He opened a 
separate bank account from his wife in 2017 from which to do so. He has not received 
financial counseling. As of the hearing, his monthly net remainder after he paid their bills 
was minimal. He also had minimal savings, as he used the money he earned while he 
was deployed to pay personal loans. He testified that they have $50,000 in assets, 
consisting of hand-made rugs, carpets, and furniture, and his attempts to sell these 
assets so that he could use the money to resolve his delinquent debts had been 
unsuccessful.16

 In July 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony domestic assault 
and two counts of misdemeanor domestic assault. Applicant testified that he had 
received bad news about his mother and he was consequently unable to eat for two to 
three days, but he consumed alcohol and got drunk. He argued with his wife after she 
poured out his alcohol, because she felt he should not be drinking. He did not recall the 
specifics, but he denied the claims made by his wife and one son, and testified that he 
did not strangle his wife nor was he a direct threat to either of them. He testified that the 
police arrested him, and he spent six days in jail. As of the hearing, he was offered a 
plea agreement and he expected to take it at his next court hearing, upon the advice 
from his public defender that a trial would be lengthy.17  
 
 Applicant provided documentation to show that on September 11, 2017, he pled 
nolo contendere to one count of assault and battery on his wife, and the remaining 
charges were dismissed. He received a deferred finding of guilt for 24 months; he was 
placed on supervised probation; he was ordered to undergo domestic violence and 
substance abuse assessments; he was fined; he was ordered to not have assaultive 
and harassing contact with his wife for 24 months; and he was scheduled to return to 
court in December 2017. Aside from this incident, Applicant was convicted in 2007 of 
DWI, and he was arrested in 2011 for drunk in public, but the charge was subsequently 
dismissed.18 
 
Applicant provided letters of support from individuals who attest to his 
outstanding work, professionalism, trustworthiness, integrity, and good judgment. A 
September 2017 letter from a friend and colleague who worked closely with Applicant 
since 2002, indicated that Applicant was the site manager for the defense contracting 
company overseas from 2004 to 2007 and 2015 to 2017. The individual further 
indicated that he worked closely with Applicant under very difficult and dangerous 
conditions, in various war zones, and trusted Applicant’s integrity and judgment without 
hesitation. Applicant also provided a December 2009 certificate of appreciation for his 
professionalism, dedication, and commitment to excellence, and a 2011 commendation 
for his work as an interpreter overseas.19  
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
                                                     
17 Tr. at 32-33, 67-76, 86-88; GEs 1, 7; AE F at 1; AE H at 7-11. 
 
18 Tr. at 32-33, 67-76, 86-88; GEs 1, 7; AE F at 1; AE H at 7-11. 
 
19 AE F at 2; AE H at 1-3, 5, 12-17.         
 
 
7 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
 
8 
 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his debts, to include his delinquent federal taxes. 
The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying 
conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i. The remainder of Applicant’s 
SOR debts, however, are unresolved. He did not provide corroborating documentation 
 
9 
 
to show that he made a good-faith effort to resolve them. His finances are not under 
control. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that his financial problems are 
unlikely to recur. His failure to address his delinquent debts casts doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to SOR ¶ 1.i, but not 
to SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c to 1.h, and 1.j. AG ¶ 20(g) applies to SOR ¶ 1.b. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 
20(e) do not apply. 
 
Conditions beyond his control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. For 
the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided corroborating 
documentation of his efforts to resolve his remaining SOR debts. There is insufficient 
evidence to conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) 
is partially applicable.    
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
AG ¶ 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. I considered the following relevant: 
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  
Applicant was arrested and charged in July 2017 with felony domestic assault 
and two counts of misdemeanor domestic assault. He pled nolo contendere in 
September 2017 to one count of misdemeanor domestic assault and the remaining 
charges were dismissed. He received a deferred finding of guilt for 24 months; he was 
placed on supervised probation; he was ordered to undergo domestic violence and 
substance abuse assessments; he was fined; he was ordered to not have assaultive 
and harassing contact with his wife for 24 months; and he was scheduled to return to 
court in December 2017. AG ¶ 31(b) applies. 
I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 32 and considered 
the following relevant:  
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; and  
 
10 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited 
to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, 
compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher 
education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
 Applicant testified that his arrest and charges in July 2017 occurred because he 
consumed alcohol, got drunk, and argued with his wife after he received bad news 
about his mother. He provided court records from September 2017 reflecting that he is 
on court-ordered supervised probation for 24 months. In light of the recency of his 
criminal conduct, I am unable to find evidence of successful rehabilitation or that so 
much time has elapsed and that it does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F and Guideline J in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I have considered Applicant’s work for his current defense contractor in various 
positions since 2003. I have considered his deployments overseas from September 
2008 to September 2013, June 2015 to December 2016, and November 2016 to April 
2017, in which he worked under difficult and dangerous conditions, and in various war 
zones. I have considered his December 2009 certificate of appreciation for his 
professionalism, dedication, and commitment to excellence, and his 2011 
commendation for his work as an interpreter overseas. I have considered that he has 
held a DOD security clearance since 2007.

Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,

Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.h, 1.j:   Against Applicant  
 
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:     Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
