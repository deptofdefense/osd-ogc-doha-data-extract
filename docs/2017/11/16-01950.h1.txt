FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on June 4, 2015. On January 
6, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent 
him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The 
DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on 
September 1, 2006.1 
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines for all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. The changes resulting 
from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2017, and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 24, 2017, and 
the case was assigned to an administrative judge on June 13, 2017. It was reassigned to 
me on August 3, 2017, because of workload. On August 16, 2017, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for 
September 13, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 
through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not 
present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept 
the record open until October 13, 2017, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. 
He did not submit anything further. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 22, 
2017. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions 
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old electronics technician employed by a federal contractor 
since December 2012. He was employed by another federal contractor from August 2008 
to June 2010. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from October 1984 to 
October 1988 and received an honorable discharge. He has never held a security 
clearance. He applied for a security clearance in 2010, but it was denied because of his 
financial problems. (Tr. 7, 15-16.) 
 
Applicant married in February 1987 and divorced in April 2006. He has two adult 
children. He graduated from high school in 1984 and has about two years of college but 
no degree. (Tr. 17.) 
 
 Until recently, Applicant’s take-home pay every two weeks was about $1,800. He 
recently was promoted and his pay was increased from $18 per hour to $24 per hour. He 
normally works about 50 hours per week. He has about $7,000 in savings and a balance 
of about $2,000 in a checking account. He has a retirement account, but he does not 
know how much is in the account. (Tr. 21-23.) He has a net monthly remainder of $500-
$700 after paying all expenses. (Tr. 26.)  
 
 Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013 and all 
dischargeable debts were discharged in August 2013. (GX 4.) After his bankruptcy 
discharge, the IRS released all liens and terminated collection action for delinquent 
federal income taxes for tax years 1997 through 2002, totaling about $36,955.  
 
 Applicant’s federal tax debt arose when he did not file income tax returns from 
1997 through 2003, because he could not afford to pay the taxes due. (Tr. 29.) He testified 
that he hired an accountant and filed his tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in 2008, and has 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
3 
 
timely filed all his federal income tax returns since 2008. (Tr. 30-31.) However, he 
submitted no documentary evidence to corroborate his testimony. In his answer to the 
SOR, he admitted that he owed about $3,371 for tax year 2003; $4,343 for 2004; $3,001 
for 2005; $3,927 for 2006; $2,006 for 2007; and $809 for 2008. He also admitted that the 
IRS filed a tax lien against him for $10,542 for tax years 2003 and 2004, and that the lien 
is unsatisfied. At the hearing, he testified that he contacted the IRS in 2013, made a 
payment agreement, and is making regular payments of at least $100, but he submitted 
no documentation of a payment agreement or any payments. (Tr. 34-36.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
 
4 
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in April 2013 
and that all dischargeable debts were discharged in August 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also 
alleges that after his debts were discharged, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released 
all tax liens and terminated collection action for delinquent taxes for 1997 through 2002, 
totaling about $36,955 (SOR ¶ 1.b). It further alleges that he is indebted to the IRS for 
about $3,371 for tax year 2003; $4,343 for 2004; $3,001 for 2005; $3,927 for 2006; $2,006 
for 2007; and $809 for 2008 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.h). Finally, it alleges that the IRS filed a tax 
lien against him in December 2008 for about $10,542 for tax years 2003 and 2004 (SOR 
¶ 1.i). 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
 
5 
 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The tax lien alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is for the same delinquent taxes alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the 
same guideline, the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). 
Accordingly, I have resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d in Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Applicant’s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(a) 
(“inability to satisfy debts”); AG ¶ 19(b) (“unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the 
ability to do so”); AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”); and AG ¶ 
19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.”) The following 
mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 
6 
 
None of the mitigating conditions are established. Applicant’s tax debts are 
numerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to 
recur. He submitted no evidence of conditions beyond his control or financial counseling. 
He claimed that he had filed his past-due returns, entered into a payment agreement for 
his delinquent taxes, and was making regular payments, but he provided no documentary 
evidence to support his claims, even though he was given an additional 30 days to submit 
such evidence. It is reasonable to expect an applicant to present documentary evidence 
showing resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 19, 2016). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).3 I have incorporated 
my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis and applied the 
adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I have considered Applicant’s honorable military service 
and his service as an employee of federal contractors. After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context 
of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised 
by his failures to timely file his federal income tax returns and his failure to resolve his 
current federal tax debt. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:    For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.i:    Against Applicant 
 
  
                                                          
3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.

Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
