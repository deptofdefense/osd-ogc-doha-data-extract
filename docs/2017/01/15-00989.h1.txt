GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 15, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On July 6, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on 
August 19, 2015.2 On October 10, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to him, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and 
modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 22, 2015. On November 12, 2015, he 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.3 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 16, 
2016. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on April 7, 2016. On April 15, 2016, Applicant’s attorney filed an Entry of Appearance and 
indicated he would furnish his proposed exhibits to Department Counsel early the 
following week. On April 18, 2016, Applicant’s attorney filed a Motion to Continue based 
on insufficient time to obtain investigative files and prepare for the hearing. The 
investigative file had already been furnished to Applicant, and I agreed to hold the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. After conferring with both attorneys, the Motion 
was effectively withdrawn. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 25, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5 and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE L were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2016. I kept the record open until 
May 23, 2016 to enable Applicant to supplement it. Upon Applicant’s Motion to Continue, 
and without objection being interposed by Department Counsel, the record was kept open 
until June 27, 2016. Applicant took advantage of those opportunities and he submitted 
various additional documents, some of which duplicated other documents previously 
submitted.4 There being no objection, AE M through AE Q were admitted. The record 
closed on June 27, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, two (¶¶ 1.a. and 
1.b.) of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s 
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, 
I make the following additional findings of fact:

4 Applicant’s subsequent submissions were marked by him as proposed exhibits 1 (two separate groups), 2 
(two separate groups), 3 (two separate groups), 4, and 5. Adding to the confusion, the documents with the same group 
designations were not identical. Accordingly, those groups of documents were remarked by me and given new 
designations.

Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
software engineer with the company since December 2013.5 He is a June 1986 high 
school graduate, with a May 1991 bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering.6 
Applicant has never served in the U.S. military.7 He has never held a security clearance.8 
Applicant was married in October 2006.9 Applicant has two children, born in 2011 and 
2014.10 
 
Financial Considerations11 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until June 2010 when he 
left his full-time job as a senior software engineer, where he had been employed since 
December 2002, to pursue other opportunities, with a focus on missionary work. He spent 
his time completing the application and accompanying requirements for missionary work, 
but did not follow through sufficiently to start raising funds for foreign field work or to obtain 
an actual position. He remained in an unemployed status until December 2013. During 
that entire period, he dealt with his son’s autism spectrum disorder medical issues, 
renovated a condominium he owned, and caught up on some computer programing. He 
did not collect unemployment compensation, and he was supported financially by his 
wife.12 For a variety of reasons, including losing track of, or forgetting, certain bills; 
disputing charges on an account; an inability to pay a bill because of his unemployment; 
and issuing an insufficient check, accounts became delinquent.13  
Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax 
years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns were 
both filed in April 2013; the 2012 federal tax return was filed in May 2013; and the 2013 
and 2014 state and federal tax returns were both filed in November 2015 – one month 
after the SOR was issued.14 He did not timely file for automatic extensions of time to file

any of those income tax returns, but he did timely file a request for an automatic extension 
of time to file his 2015 federal tax return, and that return was filed in April 2016.15 Applicant 
received a refund for each of the tax years filed.  
Applicant attributed several factors for his failure to timely file his 2013 and 2014 
tax returns: (a) some complications arose with his taxes associated with exercised stock 
options from his employer in 2010; (b) getting the necessary tax documents together took 
time; (c) his son was born six weeks prematurely, requiring significant medical attention; 
(d) his wife had preeclampsia; (e) his son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, 
requiring 24-hour supervision because he is nonverbal, not potty-trained, and a flight risk; 
(f) Applicant does his own taxes on-line, and he had computer issues preventing him from 
using his tax preparation software; (g) he had to relocate his residence on an emergency 
basis due to lead in his original residence; (h) his daughter’s social security card was 
misplaced and it was required to claim her as a dependent; and (i) and other “life 
priorities.”16   
Applicant subsequently acknowledged that since the birth of his son in 2011, he 
spent very little time working on the home renovations or keeping current on computer 
education, and after he obtained his new position in 2013, his wife took care of their son 
during the day.17 He also explained why he decided not to hire the professional services 
of a tax preparer or attorney to handle his unfiled federal and state income tax returns:18 
The primary consideration was that a lot of that had to do with getting the 
right paperwork together and my time in trying to track that down. Because 
it’s not something that I necessary had, I would have to go and get it. And 
there were other issues, as well. I mentioned complications with the 
paperwork. I know that one of the forms was from the –from my former 
employer was, well, actually, the acquiring company of my former employer 
was amended. So getting all that together was the issue. Even if I had a tax 
preparer, we couldn’t prepare those taxes unless I have those documents. 
Hiring a tax preparer wouldn’t necessarily have accelerated that. It would 
have added to the list of things for me to do as far as getting the paperwork 
or the urgency for getting the paperwork together. But not having it, it 
wouldn’t have helped me get it together any faster. 
In addition to the allegations related to unfiled federal and state income tax returns 
for the tax years 2013 and 2014 (the income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, and

2012 were not addressed), the SOR identified one purportedly delinquent debt that had 
been placed for collection or charged off, as generally reflected by the June 2014 credit 
report,19 the January 2015 credit report,20 the July 2015 credit report,21 and an April 2016 
credit report.22 That debt, totaling $342, its current status, according to the credit reports, 
other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments 
regarding same, is described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a bank credit card with a $27,500 credit limit and a past due 
amount of $342 that was placed for collection and charged off. Applicant stated that the 
bank notified him of a possible suspicious transaction. When he viewed his monthly 
statement he found a December 2010 charge in the amount of $80.99 that he did not 
recognize. He filled out various forms for the bank and submitted them in 2011, but the 
bank claimed they were never received. Nevertheless, the credit card was closed, and 
Applicant was issued a new card with another account number. When he received the 
statement for the new card, he saw a $3 charge for life insurance which was automatically 
charged to his card. He disputed the new charge as well. He contends the remaining 
balance is comprised of the unauthorized charges, accumulated interest, and fees. The 
bank was steadfast, and nothing was accomplished. Applicant indicated an intention to 
hire an attorney in September 2014, but he did not do so until April 2016. 23 Although 
Applicant’s meeting with the attorney was scheduled for May 3, 2016, he subsequently 
offered no updated status of the delinquent account or any plans to resolve it. The account 
remains unresolved. 
Applicant contends that he has sufficient funds available to pay off his only 
delinquent debt. He submitted several documents indicating income and expenses, but 
the numbers reflected are somewhat inconsistent. According to earning statements, his 
net monthly income as of March 25, 2016, was approximately $4,362.74 (or $2,181.37 
twice per month). His gross income for the same period was $8,930.78 (or $4,464.39 
twice per month).24 His wife’s net monthly income, as of April 4, 2016, was approximately 
$4,192.56 (or $2,096.28 twice per month). Her gross income for the same period was 
$5,581.76 (or $2,790.88 twice per month).25 His monthly budget reflects a combined 
gross income of $12,740 along with discretionary savings of $3,049.30.26 Another budget, 
pertaining to his salary, without reference to his wife’s salary, reflects his income as $7,

(CCCS), and the budget with the deficiency was prepared.28 Applicant did not reveal 
whether he received any financial guidance on matters other than the budget. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”29 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”30   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”31 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced

31 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.

substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.32  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”33  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”34 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .

8 
                                      
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Under AG ¶ 19(g), security concerns may be raised when there is a 
“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in June 2010, 
and increased during the ensuing years. Accounts became delinquent. At least one 
account was charged off. He failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns 
for the tax years 2013 and 2014.35 AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”36 In addition, it 
                                                          
35 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2012. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines 
is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 
2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 
(App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Consideration that Applicant did 
not timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2012 will not be considered except for the 
five purposes listed above.  
 
36 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) where “the individual has a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. 
As noted above, Applicant’s financial problems were attributed to a variety of factors. The 
2013 and 2014 state and federal tax returns were not filed until November 2015 – one 
month after the SOR was issued, because: (a) some complications arose with his taxes 
associated with exercised stock options from his employer in 2010; (b) getting the 
necessary tax documents together took time; (c) his son was born six weeks prematurely, 
requiring significant medical attention; (d) his wife had preeclampsia; (e) his son was 
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, requiring 24-hour supervision because he is 
nonverbal, not potty-trained, and a flight risk; (f) Applicant does his own taxes on-line, and 
he had computer issues preventing him from using his tax preparation software; (g) he 
had to relocate his residence on an emergency basis due to lead in his original residence; 
(h) his daughter’s social security card was misplaced and it was required to claim her as 
a dependent; and (i) and other “life priorities.” His explanations for the multi-year delay in 
obtaining the necessary documentation are difficult to accept, and his reasons for failing 
to accept professional guidance is unreasonable. Furthermore, some of those factors 
were effectively minimized when Applicant acknowledged that some of those factors did 
not occur over extended periods. Applicant’s chosen status of unemployment while 
anticipating a prospective move into a mission responsibility, as with many of the other 
factors addressed above, was of his own doing, and not largely beyond his control.  
 
A willful failure to timely file a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level 
federal criminal offense.37 For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s 
failure to timely file his federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime.  
 
The record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. The DOHA Appeal Board has 
commented:38 
                                                          
37Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, 
keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without regard to 
existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th 
Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, 
does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-

Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
Applicant contends that he has sufficient funds available to pay his remaining 
delinquent debt, but he has failed to generate efforts to do so. Instead, he has 
procrastinated since 2011 to resolve that $342 debt and, it was not until months after the 
SOR was received that he took steps to engage the services of an attorney to do so. In 
failing to timely file he federal and state income tax returns and resolve his long-standing 
delinquent debt, he appears to have acted imprudently and irresponsibly. Applicant’s 
actions, or inactions, under the circumstances confronting him, continue to cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.39 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
                                                          
of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).

consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.40       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant’s financial problems were primarily associated 
with his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2010 
through 2014. The 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns were both filed in April 2013; the 
2012 federal tax return was filed in May 2013; and the 2013 and 2014 state and federal 
tax returns were both filed in November 2015 – one month after the SOR was issued. He 
received a refund for each of the tax years filed. He timely filed his federal and state 
income tax return for 2015. While there may have been instances when Applicant 
encountered difficulties maintaining some accounts in a current status, he apparently was 
able to resolve most of them, with one noted exception. Applicant’s combined family 
income leaves him with a substantial monthly remainder available for discretionary 
savings or spending.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. As noted above, Applicant’s explanations for his repeated multi-year failure 
to comply with the law related to the timely filing his federal income tax returns are 
inconsistent and somewhat inflated. They were (a) some complications arose with his 
taxes associated with exercised stock options from his employer in 2010; (b) getting the 
necessary tax documents together took time; (c) his son was born six weeks prematurely, 
requiring significant medical attention; (d) his wife had preeclampsia; (e) his son was 
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, requiring 24-hour supervision because he is 
nonverbal, not potty-trained, and a flight risk; (f) Applicant does his own taxes on-line, and 
he had computer issues preventing him from using his tax preparation software; (g) he 
had to relocate his residence on an emergency basis due to lead in his original residence; 
(h) his daughter’s social security card was misplaced and it was required to claim her as 
a dependent; and (i) and other “life priorities.” His explanations for the multi-year delay in 
obtaining the necessary documentation are difficult to accept, and his reasons for failing 
to accept professional guidance is unreasonable. Furthermore, some of those factors 
were effectively minimized when Applicant acknowledged that some of those factors did 
not occur over extended periods. Applicant’s chosen status of unemployment while 
anticipating a prospective move into a mission responsibility, as with many of the other 
factors addressed above, was of his own doing, and not largely beyond his control.  
With respect to the supposedly fraudulent delinquent debt for $342, once again, 
Applicant’s procrastination or obstinence seem to be central causes of his failure to take 
timelier and effective action to resolve the debt first established in 2010. Applicant 
previously indicated an intention to hire an attorney in September 2014, but the only 
evidence that a meeting had actually been scheduled was a letter acknowledging a 
meeting scheduled for May 3, 2016. No result of that meeting was submitted before the 
                                                          
40 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2006).

record closed. Applicant continues to act imprudently and irresponsibly. Applicant’s 
actions, or inactions, under the circumstances confronting him, continue to cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
amended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c.:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
