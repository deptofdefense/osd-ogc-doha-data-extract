BORGSTROM, Eric H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 4, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on January 19, 2016, and he elected to have 
the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On, February 26, 2016, the 
Government submitted its file of relevant material (FORM) and provided a complete 
copy to Applicant.  Applicant received the FORM on March 9, 2016.  Applicant was 
afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM within 30 days of its receipt and to file 
 
2 
 
objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.  
He did not provide any response.  The case was assigned to me on December 5, 2016.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
In the FORM, Department Counsel references FORM Items 1-5.  FORM Item 1 
consists of the Statement of Reasons and Applicant’s Answer, which are pleadings and 
are entered into the administrative record.  FORM Item 3 is an unauthenticated 
summary of a January 7, 2015 interview with a government background investigator.  In 
the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that he could object to FORM Item 3 
and it would not be admitted, or that he could make corrections, additions, deletions, 
and update the document to make it accurate.  Applicant was informed that his failure to 
respond to the FORM or to raise any objections could be constituted as a waiver, and 
the evidence would be considered by me.  Applicant failed to respond to the FORM, and 
he raised no objections.  Moreover, in light of Department Counsel’s advisement and 
the Appeal Board rulings in ISCR Case Nos. 15-05252 and 14-06781, my sua sponte 
exclusion of FORM Item 3 may constitute error.1  Therefore, I admitted the Government 
Exhibits, identified as FORM Items 2-5, without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 46 years old.2 Although he did not complete high school, he 
received his General Equivalency Degree (GED) in about 1987.3  He received his 
welding certification in July 2014.4  Between December 2003 and November 2013, 
Applicant worked full-time in the private sector, at times with two full-time jobs.  From 
December 2013 to July 2014, he was unemployed.  While unemployed, he was 
supported by unemployment compensation benefits and his girlfriend, with whom he 
has lived since August 2004.5  Since August 2014, he has been employed full-time by a 
DOD contractor. 6  Applicant has a 15-year-old son and a 20-year-old son.7

element must be knowing and intelligent.  The Judge’s exclusion of the Report of Interview, containing 
mitigating evidence, was found to be error following applicant’s appeal.).  See also ISCR Case No. 14-

 The SOR alleges one unpaid judgment, two state tax liens, and 16 delinquent 
debts, totaling approximately $13,210.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted 
the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.8   
 
 The unpaid judgment (SOR ¶ 1.a.) was entered in May 2008 in the approximate 
amount of $1,190, as established by the September 2014 credit report.9   
  
 Applicant admitted the state tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.b.), filed in August 2006, in the 
approximate amount of $2,502.10  In his response to the SOR, Applicant includes an 
“Installment Payment Agreement,” showing a payment plan for 58 months at $25 per 
month,11 however, Applicant provided no evidence of any payments in adherence to 
that payment plan.  Furthermore, Applicant’s documentation does not appear to match 
any case number associated with the liens alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. or ¶ 1.c.   
 
 Applicant admitted a second state tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.c.), filed in June 2006, in the 
approximate amount of $499.12  As with SOR ¶ 1.b., there is no evidence of payments 
to resolve this tax lien. 
 
 As to the child support collection account (SOR ¶ 1.d.) in the approximate 
amount of $5,584, Applicant provided documentation showing that his total child-
support arrears are approximately $5,158.13  As of December 2015, Applicant’s wages 
were garnished at $71 per week for his current child-support obligation and an 
additional $35 per week for his child-support arrearages.14  Applicant claimed that after 
his son’s birth in 1996, he provided financial support to the child’s mother when he was 
able.15  Applicant further claimed that because he provided the support directly to his 
son’s mother that perhaps the child-support agency was unaware of his payments until 
about 2004, when his wages were garnished.16  Applicant has provided no 
corroborating documentation or further information as to the amounts of the payments 
he provided directly to his son’s mother.

 Two medical collection accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.) in the approximate 
amounts of $1,235 and $892 were placed for collection in about June 2014.17  Two 
additional collection accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.h.) in the approximate amounts of 
$296 and $257 were placed for collection in about May 2014 and February 2013, 
respectively.18  There is no evidence of steps taken to resolve these debts. 
 
 The SOR alleges nine traffic or parking tickets (SOR ¶¶ 1.i. to 1.q.) totaling 
approximately $695.  Applicant’s September 2014 credit report lists these nine accounts 
as having been placed for collection between August 2013 and April 2014.19  There is 
no evidence of steps taken to resolve these debts. 
 
 Applicant claims that the two medical collection accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r. 
and 1.s., were incurred while he was unemployed and should have been covered under 
a state health insurance plan.20  Applicant’s September 2014 credit report lists these 
accounts as having originated in September 2013 and as having been assigned to 
collection in January 2014.21  According to Applicant’s work history, he was employed 
until November 2013, and the debts were incurred in September 2013.  Given the 
documentary evidence in conflict with Applicant’s claimed dispute, he has not 
adequately explained and provided evidence why he does not owe these two debts. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

19  Item 5 at 4-6. 
 
20 Item 2 at 4. 
 
21 Item 5 at 6. 
 
5 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
  
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
6 
 
 Applicant’s 19 debts total approximately $12,784, given the reduction in the child-
support arrearages.  Some of the debts, such as the state tax liens, date back to 2006.  
Accordingly, the evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying 
conditions.  
 
 Since the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence 
to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.22  An applicant has the burden of 
proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the 
Government.23  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security 
concerns are provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
With the exception of the involuntary wage garnishment for the child support 
arrearages, there is no record evidence of any payments upon the 19 alleged 
delinquent accounts.  Although Applicant may have initiated an installment plan for 
repayment of a state tax lien, there is no evidence of any payments in adherence to that 
payment plan.  Because Applicant’s debts are ongoing and unresolved, AG ¶ 20(a) is 
not applicable. 
 
The application of AG ¶ 20(b) requires  both (1) Applicant’s financial 
indebtedness resulted from circumstances beyond his control and (2) Applicant acted 
                                                          
22 Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
23 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

responsibly under the circumstances.24  Applicant’s employment history indicates that 
he has been gainfully employed full-time – often with two full time jobs – since 
December 2003.  The only period of unemployment was December 2013 to July 2014.  
With the exception of two or three of the traffic tickets, all of the alleged delinquent debts 
predate Applicant’s period of unemployment.  Nonetheless, because Applicant’s period 
of unemployment may have hindered his ability to address his delinquent debts, it may 
constitute circumstances beyond one’s control in the context of AG ¶ 20(b).  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that an applicant act responsibly under the 
circumstances.  The second prong of AG ¶ 20(b) does not require an applicant to be 
debt-free or develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. 25  
Here, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant acted responsibly to 
address his delinquent debts or to develop and implement a reasonable debt repayment 
plan, whether before, during, or after his eight-month period of unemployment.  
Therefore, I conclude that AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply.   
 
There is neither record evidence of credit counseling nor record evidence, such 
as a monthly budget, to conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control.  Rather, the absence of evidence of payments or 
other steps to resolve the alleged delinquent debts undercuts such a conclusion.  
Therefore, AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. 
 
As discussed above, notwithstanding Applicant’s installment agreement, there is 
no evidence of good-faith payments or other steps taken to resolve the alleged 
delinquent debts.  The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or 
obligation.”26  Although Applicant’s installment plan may show his intent to make 
payments to resolve his delinquent tax liens, “intentions to pay off debts in the future are 
not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches.”27   
Therefore, because there is no record evidence that Applicant’s payments toward his 
child support arrearages were voluntarily established,28 AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply.   
 
To the extent Applicant disputes the legitimacy of the two medical accounts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r. and 1.s., the record evidence undermines his claims of dispute.  
The two medical collection accounts appear to have originated in about September 
                                                          
24 See ISCR Case No. 07-09304 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008). 
 
25 ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009)(“All that is required is that an applicant act 
responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by 
‘concomitant conduct,’ that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.”). 
 
26 See ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 10 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010)(Good-faith effort to resolve debts must be 
evidenced by a meaningful track record of repayment).  
 
27 ISCR Case No. 08-08440 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009). 
 
28 See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009)(“On its face, satisfaction of a debt through 
the involuntary establishment of a creditor’s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith 
initiation of repayment by the debtor.”).

2013 when Applicant was still employed. Even assuming Applicant was able to show 
that these two debts occurred during his period of unemployment, he has not provided 
substantial evidence to demonstrate that he is not liable for these two debts.   Thus, AG 
¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
 
Absent evidence of debt repayment and financial responsibility, I find that 
financial considerations concerns remain. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F and the factors in AG ¶ 2(c) in this whole-person analysis.  
 
Applicant was provided an opportunity in his SOR response and in response to 
the Government’s FORM to explain the circumstances that led to these financial 
delinquencies, to show what steps he has taken to resolve these delinquencies, and to 
provide documentation, however, no such information was provided.  As a result, the 
totality of the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the 
financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.s.:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
