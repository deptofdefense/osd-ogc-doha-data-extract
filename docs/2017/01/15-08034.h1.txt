HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling 
$73,402. He recently made five payments under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy wage earner’s 
plan; however, he has not established a sufficient track record of debt payments. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On April 22, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On February 6, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On May 12, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and waived his right to a 
hearing. On June 30, 2016, Applicant requested a hearing. (Tr. 17) On July 20, 2016, 
Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On August 30, 2016, the case 
was assigned to me. On October 4, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October 30, 2016. (HE 1) 
Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of his 
hearing. (Tr. 17-19) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant offered one exhibit; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 20-25; GE 1-9; Applicant Exhibit 
(AE) A) On November 6, 2016, Department Counsel provided nine post-hearing  exhibits, 
which were admitted without objection. (GE 10-18) On November 7, 2016, DOHA 
received the transcript of the hearing. On November 10, 2016, Applicant provided one 
exhibit consisting of 17 pages, which was admitted without objection. (AE B) The record 
closed on November 21, 2016. (Tr. 52)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a through 
1.s. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old technician who has been employed by a government 
contractor for 13 years. (Tr. 5, 8) He attended college for about one year. (Tr. 6) In 1989, 
he married, and in 2004, he divorced. (GE 1) In 2006, he married his current spouse. (GE 
1) His two children from his first marriage are ages 22 and 26, and his two children from 
his current marriage are ages 2 and 3. (Tr. 7-8) He has never served in the U.S. Armed 
Forces. (Tr. 6) A security clearance is required for his current employment. (Tr. 8-9) There 
is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant said his financial problems were caused by his divorce in 2004, which 
ended his first marriage. (Tr. 26-29) He was required to pay monthly child support of about 
$1,000, and he was allocated responsibility for paying several marital debts. (Tr. 26-27) 
He accrued additional debts after the divorce. (Tr. 33) He has had several delinquent 
debts for at least five years. (GE 2; GE 3) In 2004, he was making about $25 an hour, 
and he currently makes $35 an hour. (Tr. 31-32) Applicant’s monthly income is $5,080, 
and his spouse’s monthly income is $1,814. (GE 8 at 23) Their monthly remainder is $891. 
(GE 8 at 25)

 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, bankruptcy schedules, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal 
subject interviews (PSI) in 2010 and 2015, and hearing record. The status of the SOR 
allegations is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges and the record establishes that Applicant filed for bankruptcy 
protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in May 2015, and in October 2015, 
this bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant failed to provide documentation to the 
trustee. (SOR response; GE 18)  
 
In December 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, and in May 2016, the bankruptcy was dismissed because Applicant 
failed to provide necessary documentation to the trustee. (GE 17)2 His April 8, 2016 
bankruptcy schedules listed: ownership of two motorcycles and two cars (GE 8 at 3); 
$31,500 owed on one vehicle purchased in 2014 (GE 8 at 11); $31,500 owed on one 
motorcycle purchased in 2014 (GE 8 at 12); $50,000 in a 401(k) account (GE 8 at 6, 18); 
$100 owed on his state income tax (GE 8 at 13); and $4,700 owed on his federal income 
tax. (GE 8 at 14; AE B at 2) The motorcycle purchased in 2014 was surrendered to the 
creditor. (AE B at 2)  
 
The October 1, 2016 trustee’s report of distributions for Applicant’s Chapter 13 
bankruptcy shows $890 received in June 2016, August 2016, and September 2016 for a 
total received of $2,670. (AE B at 2) Applicant provided receipts showing payments of 
$1,137 to the trustee on January 26, 2016, and $1,780 on May 27, 2016. (AE B at 16-17) 
The disposition of the payments made in January and May 2016 is not indicated in the 
record evidence. On September 2, 2016, he paid the trustee $894, and on October 2, 
2016, he paid the trustee $894. (AE B at 15) At his hearing, he said he is working on 
getting a new payment plan for his bankruptcy. (Tr. 45) His current monthly payment is 
$955. (Tr. 46) He said he has made about five payments to the trustee. (Tr. 46-49) 
Applicant is credited with making five payments to the trustee from June through October 
2016. 
                                            
2Applicant’s SOR does not allege: his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2016; 
a delinquent corporate credit card debt for $3,430 has been delinquent for several years; and his April 22, 
2015 SCA described a delinquent personal loan for $15,700. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). His 
second Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissal in May 2016, his delinquent corporate credit card debt for $3,430, 
and his delinquent personal loan for $15,700 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed 
above.

SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.s allege 18 delinquent debts totaling $73,402. The only 
payments to any of the SOR creditor were through his Chapter 13 plan, and those 
payments were made to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 52; AE B) The SOR included the 
following delinquent debts: a delinquent vehicle loan for $27,828 (SOR 1.b); state income 
taxes for $100 (SOR ¶ 1.d); federal income taxes for $2,500 (SOR ¶ 1.e); repossession 
of a motorcycle for $28,023 (SOR ¶ 1.c); and two municipal debts for $420 and $147 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.q and 1.r). The SOR did not include a corporate credit card debt for $3,430, 
which became delinquent in October 2014, and a delinquent personal loan for $15,700. 
(GE 1; GE 3)    
 
In 2014, Applicant purchased a motorcycle and car. (Tr. 36) When he made these 
purchases, he already owned a truck and another motorcycle. (Tr. 37-38) He owes about 
$3,000 to $5,000 for his state income taxes for 2014. (Tr. 43-44) He may owe about 
$4,700 on his federal income taxes; however, he was unsure about his federal income 
tax debt. (Tr. 44) He received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process.     
 
On June 6, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) billed Applicant $511 for 
federal income taxes for tax year 2015. (AE B at 13) On June 17, 2016, he paid the $511 
debt owed to the IRS. (AE B at 14)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
 
5 
                                         
 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
 
6 
                                         
 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted). 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, OPM PSIs, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions 
that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” The 
record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant’s stated efforts to resolve his delinquent debt do not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to any of his SOR debts. Applicant said his 
financial problems were caused by his divorce in 2004, which ended his first marriage.  
He was required to pay monthly child support of about $1,000, and he was allocated 
responsibility for paying several marital debts. He accrued additional debts after the 
divorce. In 2004, he was making about $25 an hour, and he currently makes $35 an hour. 
Applicant did not provide enough details about what he did to address his SOR debts 
after his divorce, which was 12 years ago. He received financial counseling.    
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation relating to his SOR debts: (1) 
proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a 
letter from creditors proving that he paid or made payments to the creditors; (2) 
correspondence to or from any creditors to establish maintenance of contact with 
creditors;4 (3) credible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for 
the debts and why he held such a belief; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, such 
as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve debts; or 
(5) other evidence of progress or resolution of his debts. Applicant failed to establish 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(e) for any other SOR debts because he did not provide 
documented proof to substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. 
   
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress resolving his SOR debts before starting his current Chapter 13 payment plan in 
                                            
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

June 2016. He has not provided sufficient payments under his Chapter 13 payment plan 
to provide confidence that he will continue making payments and complete the Chapter 
13 payment plan. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old technician who has been employed by a government 
contractor for 13 years. He attended college for about one year. A security clearance is 
required for his current employment. There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant’s SOR alleges 18 
delinquent debts totaling $73,402. In May 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection 
under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, and in October 2015, the bankruptcy was 
dismissed. In December 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 
of the Bankruptcy Code, and in May 2016, the bankruptcy was dismissed. Both 
bankruptcies were dismissed because Applicant failed to provide necessary 
documentation to the trustee. In May or June 2016, the third Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
filed, and from June 2016 through October 2016, Applicant made five monthly payments 
to the trustee.   
 
Applicant did not provide documentation showing his attempts to resolve any of 
his SOR debts in good faith prior to May 2015. In 2014, he financed the purchase of a 
vehicle and a motorcycle, and shortly thereafter, he stopped making payments on the 
motorcycle loan. He may owe delinquent federal and state income taxes. His actions 
show lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about 
 
9 
                                         
 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG 
¶ 18. More information about inability to pay debts, financial history, and documented 
financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. A longer track record of 
consistent payments to the Chapter 13 trustee is necessary to establish mitigation.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able 
to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated, and it is not clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.s:  Against Applicant   
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
