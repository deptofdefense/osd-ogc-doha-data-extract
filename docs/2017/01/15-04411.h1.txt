MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s mortgage was seriously delinquent in 2015. He managed to suspend 
foreclosure of his home loan by paying 1.5 times his scheduled monthly payment since 
October 2015. He has yet to make any payments toward a home-equity line of credit 
charged off for $15,685 around August 2014 or a $14,818 credit card judgment filed in 
January 2015. His financial situation continues to raise security concerns. Clearance is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On December 7, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was 
unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security 
clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
 
2 
 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
On December 31, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On April 22, 2016, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him. I scheduled a hearing for May 17, 2016. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were 
admitted into evidence without objection. A letter forwarding discovery of the Government’s 
exhibits to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) for the record but not entered 
into evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on May 27, 
2016. 
 
I held the record open for one month for Applicant to submit documentary evidence. 
On June 17, 2016, I received by electronic mail a document in an inaccessible format 
submitted on Applicant’s behalf from his mortgage lender. An acceptable version was 
submitted by Applicant on July 19, 2016. Department Counsel filed no objection, and the 
document was admitted into the record as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 7, 2015, Applicant had not 
paid a $14,818 credit card judgment from January 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that his mortgage 
was $11,187 past due on a $112,991 balance (SOR ¶ 1.b); and that his home-equity line of 
credit had been charged off for $15,685 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant admitted the debts when he 
answered the SOR. He explained that he had incurred credit card debt while in college. 
After graduating in 2011, he began working as a bus driver for some income. In 2012, he 
suffered the first of three strokes, which left him unemployed for a couple of years and 
living on social security disability income. He explained that he was paying 1.5 times his 
mortgage payment each month to catch up. He had no success in settling the credit card 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a because he could not afford to pay the $10,000 wanted by the creditor 
to settle the debt. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old community college graduate with an associate’s degree 
awarded in May 2011. He began working as a contract computer software technician for a 
defense contractor in May 2014. Applicant was married from June 1988 to July 1996. He 
has a 15-year-old son from another relationship. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-23.) He provides financial 
assistance for his son at $80 a week, but it is not court ordered. (Tr. 30-31.) 
 
3 
 
After his divorce, Applicant lived with his brother. Applicant worked as a commercial 
roofer, and he had no trouble paying his debts on time. (GEs 1, 4.) Around November 
2004, Applicant relocated to be near his son, who was then three years old. (GE 1; Tr. 20.) 
In May 2005, Applicant purchased a two-family home, obtaining a mortgage loan of 
$134,830. (GE 4; Tr. 40.) In July 2007, Applicant was injured at work. During his lengthy 
recuperation of approximately two years, he lived off his savings and an insurance 
settlement.
1
 In June 2008, he opened a home-equity line of credit. (GE 2.) 
 
Applicant could not return to roofing because of his injury. Applicant attended a local 
community college from September 2009 to May 2011 when he earned his associate’s 
degree. The cost of his schooling and books was covered by his employer’s worker’s 
compensation insurance. (Tr. 21, 51.) He had been promised reimbursement for his travel 
costs to school, but he was not paid for his travel. (Tr. 52.) He used the credit card account 
in SOR ¶ 1.a to cover some living expenses, including gasoline for his vehicle. (GEs 1-2; 
Tr. 21, 73-74.) After earning his degree, Applicant initially could not find a job in his field. In 
September 2011, he began working as a part-time school bus driver. He earned about $9 
an hour for about 20 hours of work per week. (Tr. 63.) Around July 2012, he had the first of 
three strokes. (Tr. 21, 53-54.) He was unable to work for a few years and lived with his 
son’s mother. (Tr. 54.) Applicant had temporary social security disability income, and, in 
2012, he also received fuel assistance. (Tr. 21, 55.) By February 2013, he was seriously 
behind on his home-equity line of credit, on his mortgage, and on a credit card account 
(SOR ¶ 1.a). In October 2013, his credit card account was placed for collection for 
$14,818. His home-equity line of credit was charged off for $15,731 around August 2014. 
(GEs 2-4.)  
 
From March 2014 to May 2014, Applicant was employed as an assistant manager 
for a catering company. In May 2014, he began working for his current employer, initially in 
a contract position. On September 23, 2014, Applicant completed and certified to the 
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing. In response to inquiries concerning 
any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed the $14,818 credit card debt. 
He indicated that a civil action had been brought for the debt and that he was going to 
settle it in court. Applicant listed no other delinquent accounts. (GE 1.) 
 
As of October 8, 2014, Applicant’s credit record revealed an additional delinquency 
in that his home-equity line of credit was in collection for $15,685 after being charged off to 
profit and loss. Applicant’s mortgage loan was rated as current with a balance of $113,469. 
His home loan had been 180 days or more delinquent in the past, but he brought his home 
loan current in August 2014. (GE 3.) 
 
On November 18, 2014, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that he supported himself 
in college with his savings and an insurance settlement from his 2007 injury. During his 
unemployment from July 2007 to September 2009 because of medical issues, he worked 
around his home or went to medical appointments. Applicant explained that he became 
                                                 
1 
Applicant did not elaborate about the amount of the settlement. 
4 
 
delinquent on the credit card account in SOR ¶ 1.a around October 2010, and that he had 
not made any payments on the $14,818 balance. Applicant indicated that the debt 
prompted a lawsuit in October 2014. He expressed an intention to make repayment 
arrangements. Applicant volunteered that he had been late in paying his mortgage a month 
or two at different times during his unemployment from July 2012 to March 2014 when his 
income was limited. However, he had cashed in a $28,000 retirement fund, which he 
claimed satisfied his mortgage arrearage. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he had to 
pay at least $7,000 in fees and taxes for his early withdrawal of his retirement funds. (GE 2; 
Tr. 58-59.) Applicant did not recognize the home-equity line of credit delinquency when 
confronted about that debt by the OPM investigator. (GE 2.) Applicant could provide little 
detail about the debt at his hearing. (Tr. 79-81.) However, he recalled writing checks 
against an account to cover living expenses. (Tr. 78, 85.)  
 
Applicant’s mortgage was delinquent throughout most of 2014 and 2015. He had 
tenants in his rental unit until September 2014, but they “screwed [him] out of the last three 
months’ rent.” (Tr. 40-41.) After foreclosure proceedings had been initiated against his 
mortgage, Applicant received a call from a state housing assistance agency offering to help 
with moving expenses. Applicant arranged with his mortgage lender to pay $755 every two 
weeks (1.5 times his scheduled monthly mortgage payment) to address his mortgage 
delinquency. (Tr. 34-36.) As of late October 2015, Applicant’s mortgage was past due in 
the amount of $11,187 on an $112,991 balance. As of December 3, 2015, his credit report 
(GE 4) showed that in October 2015, he paid $1,510 toward a scheduled monthly payment 
of $1,002. It was apparently his first payment toward his arrearage. Applicant testified that 
he has continued to make the payments by automatic deduction from his bank account. 
(Tr. 38-39, 70.) His mortgage lender confirmed in June 2016 that as long as Applicant pays 
$755 every other week, the foreclosure process will be suspended. (AE A.) 
 
Applicant made no payments on his home-equity line of credit after March 2014. In 
January 2015, a collection entity obtained a $14,818 judgment against Applicant for the 
credit card delinquency in SOR ¶ 1.a. (GE 4.) Applicant had been given 90 days to settle 
the debt out of court. He offered the creditor a lump sum of $7,000, but the creditor wanted 
$10,000. (Tr. 68-69.) He has not contacted the creditor since then because of his tight 
financial situation. (Tr. 72.) 
 
Around April 2016, Applicant went on short-term medical leave. After his first week 
of leave, he began receiving disability pay at 70% of his regular wages. Applicant was still 
on medical leave as of his hearing in mid-May 2016. (Tr. 24-25, 70.) He described his 
financial situation as “rough.” His take-home pay is $1,000 every two weeks. (Tr. 31-32.) 
He has not attempted to obtain tenants for his downstairs unit, which has been vacant 
since September 2014. (Tr. 42.) Applicant pays the electric and water bills for both his unit 
and the rental unit. His water bill runs him $50 a month. His electric bill recently doubled to 
about $160 a month. (Tr. 43.) Applicant has oil heat and the cost varies with the season 
and temperature. He has paid as much as $800 for one month of home heating oil in the 
past. (Tr. 45.) He pays $40 a month for wireless phone service. Applicant has Internet 
service at $40 or $60 a month, but he cancelled his cable television service. His groceries 
run him $180 a month. He also pays $60 a month for his son’s karate lessons. (Tr. 47-49.) 
5 
 
 
As of mid-May 2016, Applicant had approximately $8,000 on deposit in his checking 
account because he had received a disability check of $24,000 in 2015. He used $13,000 
for a $20,000 car and financed the rest of the cost. Applicant is paying $155 a month for 
the car loan, which was not on his credit record as of December 2015. (GE 4; Tr. 47, 56-
57.) He did not have any savings. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant did not have any active credit card 
accounts as of May 2016. (Tr. 58.) He had not had any financial counseling. He contacted 
his state for assistance and was told he did not qualify. (Tr. 83.) 
 
Applicant had not filed his federal or state income tax returns for 2015 or asked for 
an extension of time to file those returns as of his hearing in mid-May 2016. Applicant 
believes his tax withholdings are more than adequate to cover taxes owed. (Tr. 60, 63-65.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
6 
 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet  
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The evidence establishes the financial considerations security concerns alleged in 
the SOR. Applicant’s mortgage was $11,187 past due as of late October 2015. A $14,818 
credit card judgment was obtained against him in January 2015. His home-equity line of 
credit was charged off for $15,731 in August 2014. As of late October 2015, Equifax was 
reporting a past-due balance of $15,685 on the account. Applicant testified to a lack of 
knowledge about the debt, although he does not contest it. The DOHA Appeal Board has 
held that adverse information from a credit report is normally sufficient to meet the 
substantial evidence standard to establish a debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 
(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Guideline F disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations,” apply. 
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply. Applicant had brought his mortgage current around August 2014 only to 
fall seriously behind again in 2015. He has made no payments to resolve the credit card 
judgment or the charged-off home-equity line of credit. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is implicated in several aspects. Applicant’s financial problems started 
after he was injured at work around July 2007. The evidence shows that he relied on 
consumer credit while recovering from his injury and then while attending school to gain the 
skills needed to pursue a new line of work. He received an insurance settlement, and his 
college tuition and books were covered by his worker’s compensation benefits. However, 
he also did not have any employment income when he was in school. After he earned his 
7 
 
associate’s degree, he struggled to find a job in his field. He was unemployed from June 
2011 until September 2011, when he began driving a school bus. In July 2012, he suffered 
the first of three strokes that led to 1.5 years of additional unemployment. The medical 
issues with consequent unemployment trigger AG ¶ 20(b), which provides: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant also had no control over the failure of his last tenants to pay their rent for three 
months before they vacated in September 2014. Since then, Applicant has had to cover 
utility costs for both units in his two-family home. 
 
 Mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” have some applicability because Applicant has been 
paying 1.5 times his monthly mortgage obligation since October 2015 to suspend 
foreclosure proceedings. As of his May 2016 security clearance hearing, Applicant had 
$8,000 remaining from the disability settlement, which was slowly being depleted to pay his 
mortgage arrearage. Assuming no accrued interest and $508 per month going toward his 
arrearage since October 2015, Applicant was still about $5,000 behind on his mortgage as 
of May 2016. He is likely to continue to make his payments to avert foreclosure. A 
favorable finding is warranted with regard to the mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.b because of 
his efforts to resolve the delinquency. However, he had made no progress toward reducing 
the $14,818 judgment or the $15,685 past-due line of credit debt. Neither AG ¶ 20(c) nor 
AG ¶ 20(d) fully mitigates the financial considerations concerns. 
 
 The DOHA Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that 
he has paid each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR: 
 
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track 
record necessary includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, 
to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All 
that is required is that an applicant demonstrated that he has established a 
plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an 
applicant’s financial situation and evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. There is no requirement that the plan provide for payments on 
all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
8 
 
 
See ISCR 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). In Applicant’s favor, there is no evidence that he is incurring consumer credit debt 
that could further compromise his financial situation further. He cancelled his cable 
television service, and he is not opening new credit card accounts. In the past year or so, 
he purchased a car with a down payment of $13,000 from his disability settlement and a 
loan for $7,000. There is no evidence that he has been late on his car payments. His 
income has been compromised by his short-term disability since April 2016 in that his 
benefit is 70% of his usual wages. However, his continued disregard of the credit card 
judgment does not inspire confidence that he can be counted on to address his $30,503 in 
delinquent consumer credit obligations. The financial considerations concerns are not fully 
mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
2
 The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 A determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance should not be 
made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation 
of the evidence to determine if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate 
security concern. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th
 
Cir. 1990). Applicant 
had some medical setbacks that compromised his finances. Yet, he has also not acted 
entirely responsibly with regard to addressing his difficult financial situation. He has taken 
no steps to contact his creditors about the delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. He has 
taken no steps to obtain tenants for his rental unit since his last tenants vacated in 
September 2014. Unacceptable doubts persist about whether Applicant can be relied on to 
comply with rules and regulations regarding the handling of classified information, given his 
ongoing disregard of the credit card judgment. Applicant’s failure to comply with his federal 
and state income tax filing obligations for 2015 is further indication of his failure to 
appreciate the importance of complying with legal obligations.
3
 After considering all the 
                                                 
2 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
3
 The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
9 
 
facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his 
security clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). Applicant’s failure to file timely federal and state 
income tax returns or file for extensions of time to file his returns for tax year 2015 cannot provide a separate 
basis for disqualification because it was not alleged, but it is relevant to assessing Applicant’s financial 
judgment generally.
