HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Four of Applicant’s real estate properties were foreclosed from 2008 to 2010; his 
debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on June 17, 2014; and 
he owes a state tax debt of $126,123. He did not establish his financial responsibility. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On May 28, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On May 18, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant 
to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On June 9, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
July 20, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On August 30, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On September 30, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
October 26, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered 9 exhibits; Applicant offered 10 exhibits; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 15-20; GE 1-9; Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A-J) On November 3, 2016, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing.    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a, and he 
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. He also provided extenuating and 
mitigating information. Applicant’s admission is accepted as a finding of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old weapons and explosives specialist, and he has worked 
for a defense contractor for 28 years. (Tr. 8) He has held a security clearance for 30 
years. (Tr. 9) There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) He has an associate’s 
degree in general studies. (Tr. 6) He served in the Army from 1985 to 1989, and he 
received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7) His primary military occupational specialty 
(MOS) was heavy wheeled vehicle mechanic, and he left active duty as a sergeant. (Tr. 
7) He married in 1998, and his children are ages 13, 17, and 22. (Tr. 8, 45)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 In 2004, Applicant purchased his first rental property, and he financed $300,000. 
(Tr. 23) When the value of the property increased to about $800,000, Applicant 
borrowed a substantial part of the equity, and he used the funds to purchase three more 
properties in 2006 and 2007. (Tr. 23)  
 
 Applicant lived in residence LH from July 2006 to August 2010. (GE 2 at 2) 
Applicant fell behind on his mortgage payments, and residence LH was foreclosed in 
August 2010. (GE 2 at 2)2 The mortgages on LH were $900,000 and $200,000. (GE 2 at 
2) Applicant purchased three rental properties in 2005 or 2006 for $1,200,000; 
$600,000; and $286,000. (Tr. 24; GE 2 at 2) For several years, real estate prices 
increased, and then the prices declined. (Tr. 21-22) The mortgages were variable 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Applicant’s opening statement was accepted as substantive 
evidence. (Tr. 22-23) 
 
2This property may have been foreclosed in 2009.  
 
3 
                                         
 
interest rate loans, and he said the payments doubled after about two years. (Tr. 25) 
Applicant said he could not afford his mortgages, and his four properties went into 
foreclosure. (Tr. 22) He said he took about $50,000 out of his retirement account in an 
attempt to retain the properties. (Tr. 26) Even though Applicant was a real estate agent, 
he said he did not fully understand how much his mortgage payments would increase. 
(Tr. 25)   
 
 In 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited Applicant’s taxes for tax 
year 2009, and the IRS considered the reduction in Applicant’s liability after the 
foreclosures as income and assessed him for $400,000 in taxes, interests, and 
penalties. (Tr. 26-28, 33-34) As a result of the IRS audit, in 2012, he learned that he 
owed State X $19,000 for taxes. (Tr. 28-29, 35) Applicant did not make any payments to 
the IRS or attempt to make any offers to compromise his tax debts. (Tr. 34) On January 
7, 2014, he received financial counseling in the course of a planned bankruptcy. (GE 3 
at 19) Applicant followed his attorney’s advice, and on July 1, 2014, he filed for 
protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Tr. 30; GE 6) He stopped paying 
on all of his debts when he filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 31) He used the funds he 
would have otherwise used to pay his debts to pay his son’s college expenses. (Tr. 31-
32) On September 23, 2014, Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (SOR ¶ 1.c; GE 3 at 17; AE B)  
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy discharge states, “Some of the most common types of 
debts which are not discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy are: a. Debts for most taxes.” 
(AE B at 2) Applicant reaffirmed his mortgage and two car payments, and obtained a 
discharge for the remainder of his debts. (Tr. 30, 58) 
 
 A July 7, 2014 IRS letter indicates “We propose to assess additional tax on your 
account for the taxable year shown above [tax year 2009].” (GE 3 at 11) The IRS 
concluded Applicant had taxable income of $1,028,093 for tax year 2009 (mostly due to 
his lender’s releases from liability on his mortgages), and the IRS assessed additional 
tax, penalty, and interest of $125,440. (GE 3 at 11)  
 
 Applicant believed his tax debts were discharged through the Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 36) On March 19, 2015, which was after the Chapter 7 discharge, State 
X wrote Applicant and advised him that State X reassessed his taxes and determined 
that he owed $126,393 in taxes, interest, and penalties. (Tr. 36; SOR ¶ 1.b; GE 3 at 12) 
His evidence showing the federal income tax debts were resolved are IRS tax 
transcripts. (Tr. 49)3 His March 17, 2015 IRS account transcript for tax year 2009 
                                            
3Applicant’s federal tax debts meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criteria for discharge 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. See Nolo website, (In general, three criteria must be met before 
tax debts are discharged: (1) The return was due at least three years before the bankruptcy is filed; (2) 
The return was filed at least two years before the bankruptcy is filed; however, the return must be 
accurate; (3) A tax lien must not be attached to any property; and (4) The taxing authority must have 
assessed the tax (entered the liability on the taxing authority’s records) at least 240 days before the 
bankruptcy is filed.), http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-debt-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html. (HE 4)

indicates the IRS assessed an additional $306,230 in taxes owed on April 1, 2013, and 
ultimately the IRS wrote off his $398,278 tax debt. (GE 3 at 21) 
 
 In 2011, Applicant’s adjusted gross income (AGI) on his and his spouse’s tax 
return was $283,955. (GE 3 at 23) In 2012, his AGI was $295,783. (GE 3 at 25) In 2013, 
Applicant and his spouse filed separate tax returns, and his AGI was $96,108. (GE 3 at 
26) 
 
 In 2013, Applicant purchased two new vehicles and financed $70,000. (Tr. 40) 
One vehicle was for Applicant’s 18-year-old son, who was in college. (Tr. 40) In July 
2015, he assessed the value of the two vehicles to be $54,467. (GE 7 at 6)  
 
 After his nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in 2014, Applicant filed a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy to control his payments on his taxes and secured debts on July 
19, 2015.4 (Tr. 31; GE 7) Applicant is currently paying $926 monthly under his April 
2016 amendment to his Chapter 13 60-month payment plan. (Tr. 41; AE A) The trustee 
will make payments on his mortgage of $366,175 and on a vehicle loan of $34,467. (GE 
9) There is no indication of allocations to pay his delinquent state tax debt. Applicant is 
paying three debts outside of the Chapter 13 process. (GE 9) In April 2016, Applicant 
purchased a timeshare property for family vacations for an unspecified amount. (Tr. 41-
42) Applicant and his spouse’s incomes have increased after their Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
discharge. (Tr. 44, 51) On his personal financial statement (PFS), Applicant said his 
monthly income is about $8,300. (GE 3 at 9) In his July 19, 2015 bankruptcy filing, he 
indicated that he and his spouse have monthly income of $22,200. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant 
has about $300,000 in his 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 45) His July 19, 2015 Chapter 
13 filing indicates he has a State X debt for 2009 taxes of $96,393 and a $202,907 
federal income tax debt for tax year 2009. (GE 7 at 15, 17)  
  
Applicant said that before his properties went into foreclosure, his credit was 
excellent. (Tr. 47) Applicant currently owns two properties. (Tr. 22) Applicant lives in one 
property, and his father and Applicant are co-owners of the other property. (Tr. 23)

4Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s received excellent performance evaluations from his employer. (AE 
C; AE D) Applicant presented the following documents: State X Destructive Device 
Permit; State X Permit to Possess and/or Transport Machine Guns; Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives permit to transmit explosive materials; and Division 
of Occupational, Safety, and Health Administration Blaster’s license. (AE E-AE H) 
Applicant has developed two patents for his company. (AE I, AE J)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 
6 
                                         
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and 
“(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” The record established the disqualifying conditions in AG 
¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
                                         
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).6  
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important positive financial information. The decline in real estate values in State X had 
a profound negative impact on Applicant’s finances and constitutes a circumstance 
beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. This significant decline in real 
estate values was unexpected. Applicant’s properties were heavily leveraged with 
variable interest rate loans. The magnitude of his borrowing and his use of variable 
interest rate financing was very risky, and it showed lack of judgment. He did not 
provide proof that it was necessary for all four properties to go into foreclosure. The fact 
that the four properties were all “underwater” (mortgages were higher than fair market 
value) is not adequate justification to walk away from them. He did not provide sufficient 
information to establish or rule out a concern that at least one of his properties went into 
foreclosure as part of a strategic default.7 By 2014, Applicant’s financial circumstances 
had become so dire that having his unsecured nonpriority debts discharged through 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code was reasonable. Accordingly, I find for Applicant in 
regard to SOR ¶ 1.c.  
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are substantial. Applicant did not 
establish that he showed good judgment when he was so heavily leveraged in the real 
estate market, and after he learned of his tax debts, he made no payments to the 
address those tax debts, even though he had the financial resources to establish 
payment plans. Applicant’s bankruptcy filing indicates Applicant has owed significant 
federal and state taxes since he learned of them in 2011 and 2012. Applicant’s tax 
deficiency was discovered through an IRS audit in 2011.   
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding 
prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income 
tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and 
employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt 
of the SOR).   
 
The negative financial and judgment information in Applicant’s case is significant. 
The record established that Applicant has known that he owed more than $500,000 in 
federal and state taxes for tax year 2009 for more than two years. He did not disclose 
any payments to address these two tax debts. His explanations are insufficient to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns.

obligation even though he or she has the financial means to make the payments.” ISCR Case No. 11-

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 50-year-old weapons and explosives specialist, and he has worked 
for a defense contractor for 28 years. He has an associate’s degree in general studies. 
He served in the Army from 1985 to 1989, and he received an honorable discharge. 
Applicant’s received excellent performance evaluations from his employer. Applicant 
presented the following documents: State X Destructive Device Permit; State X Permit 
to Possess and/or Transport Machine Guns; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives permit to transmit explosive materials; and Division of Occupational, Safety, 
and Health Administration Blaster’s license. Applicant has developed two patents for his 
company. He has held a security clearance for 30 years. There is no evidence of 
security violations. 
 
The decline in real estate values in State X is a circumstance beyond Applicant’s 
control that adversely affected his finances. His four properties in State X were heavily 
leveraged with variable interest rate loans. The magnitude of his borrowing and his use 
of variable interest rate financing was very risky, and it showed poor judgment. After his 
debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, he accrued additional 
delinquent debt.   
 
The record established that Applicant has known for several years that he owed 
more than $500,000 in federal and state taxes for tax year 2009. He did not disclose 
any payments to address these tax debts. He used Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
September 2014 to discharge the $400,000 federal income tax debt. He did not provide 
sufficient evidence to establish his State X tax debt was resolved by his Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and I consider that debt to continue to exist. He is using Chapter 13 to 
minimize his payments to address or avoid making payments on his State X debt and 
 
10 
                                         
 
several credit card debts, even though he and his spouse make more than $200,000 
annually. He did not credibly explain why he needed to obtain Chapter 13 protection 
shortly after his debts were discharged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  
 
When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax 
returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete 
making payments.8 The primary problem here is that Applicant has known that he owed 
substantial state and federal tax debts for several years. He did not make any payments 
on the federal tax debt from 2011 to 2014, and he did not provide proof of any payments 
to address the state tax debt which he learned about in 2012.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness.  
 
                                            
8The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security 
clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking 
action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has 
rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of 
someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
