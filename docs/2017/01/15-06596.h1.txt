HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges his debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in April 2015, and a state obtained a $12,201 
judgment against Applicant in 2014. His bankruptcy included $213,857 in federal and 
state tax debt that had been delinquent since 2010. His tax debts were not discharged. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On September 26, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 20, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On May 16, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
June 29, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On August 1, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On August 30, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
September 21, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered 5 exhibits; Applicant offered 15 exhibits; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 23-28; GE 1-5; Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A-O) On September 29, 2016, DOHA received the transcript of the 
hearing. A post-hearing delay was granted until October 27, 2016, to permit Applicant to 
provide additional information about his finances. (Tr. 58) On October 27, 2016, 
Applicant requested and received an extension until November 25, 2016. (HE 4) On 
November 25, 2016, Applicant provided 14 additional exhibits, which were admitted 
without objection. (AE Q-AE AD)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, and he 
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. He also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 49 years old, and he has worked as a sales account executive on an 
intelligence community team starting in September 2016. (Tr. 6, 33-34) His base salary 
is $125,000 with another $125,000 possible incentive bonus. (Tr. 35; AE G) From 2012 
to 2015, he worked for a corporation, and his annual salary was about $160,000. (Tr. 
35) He was unemployed from January to September 2016. (Tr. 36) He provided a copy 
of his resume and biography (bio). (AE H; AE I)  
 
In 1985, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) He has two years of 
college classes, and he majored in biology and chemistry. (Tr. 7) He served in the Army 
from 1986 to 1989, and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. 
(Tr. 7-8) Applicant has been married four times: from 1988 to 1991; from 1991 to 1995; 
from 2001 to 2008; and in 2013, he married his current spouse. (Tr. 8-9; GE 1) His three 
children are ages 2 months, 9 years, and 25 years. (Tr. 9) He held a security clearance 
from 2007 to 2012. (Tr. 33) 
 
In 2010, Applicant completed two security courses. (Tr. 18-19; AE D; AE E) In 
January 2014, Applicant was diagnosed with cancer, and he was unable to work for 
about 60 days because of cancer surgery, and other cancer treatments. (Tr. 17, 20, 29, 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Applicant’s opening statement was accepted as substantive 
evidence. (Tr. 22-23) 
 
3 
                                         
 
36-37; AE B) On December 19, 2014, Applicant received financial counseling as part of 
the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 17, 30; AE C) After his debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, he has not accrued any additional delinquent debt. 
(Tr. 18) Applicant has a membership in multiple civic organizations. (Tr. 19) Applicant 
has also been politically active, and he unsuccessfully ran for an important political 
office in 2009-2010. (Tr. 19)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems were caused by an economic downturn and 
mismanagement of his company by his subordinates. (Tr. 20, 37-38) In 2003, Applicant 
started Company A to provide research and engineering services to DOD. (Tr. 37; AE 
O; AE P) In 2006, Company A began operations; Company A eventually had 25 
employees; in 2010, Company A stopped making a profit; and in 2011, Company A 
ended operations. (Tr. 37-39) He was a subcontractor, and he said, the prime contractor 
did not pay their subcontractors. (Tr. 21, 39) Other contracts ended and were not 
renewed. (Tr. 47) Applicant was the chief executive officer (CEO) and facility security 
officer (FSO) for Company A, and he signed on credit cards to make purchases on 
behalf of Company A. (Tr. 31-32) He was personally liable for Company A’s debts. (Tr. 
40) 
 
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, and hearing record. His SOR alleges two financial issues of security concern. 
The status of the SOR allegations is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in 2014, State X obtained a judgment against Applicant for 
$12,201 for tax year 2010. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant was raised in State X; he paid taxes in 
State X through tax year 2009; and he ran for political office in State X in 2010. (Tr. 41) 
In 2010, he moved to State Y, and he said State X agreed that he did not owe taxes to 
State X because he was not a resident of State X. (Tr. 42) He said he provided proof to 
State X that he paid taxes to State Y, and he predicted that State X would assist him in 
getting the judgment removed from his record. (Tr. 42)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant’s delinquent debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 9, 2015. (Tr. 43; GE 5; AE J) Applicant’s 
Schedule F (nonpriority unsecured debts) shows a total of $84,020. (GE 4) His 
Schedule I shows: gross monthly income of $11,665; net monthly income of $7,870; 
and a negative monthly remainder of negative $352. (GE 4) At his hearing, he 
presented a September 20, 2016 personal financial statement indicating monthly gross 
income of $17,500 and a monthly positive remainder of $3,813. (AE F)  
 
Applicant’s Schedule E shows a debt for 2009 and 2010 federal payroll taxes of 
$190,000 and a State Y tax debt of $23,857 for a total owed of $213,857. (Tr. 45-46, 49; 
GE 4) The State Y tax debt was for income taxes for 2010 to 2013. (GE 4) Applicant 
said that while he was running for public office, a Company A employee took over the 
business and failed to pay Company A’s Federal and State Y taxes. (Tr. 45) The 
$190,000 federal payroll tax debt survived the bankruptcy, and Applicant has not had to 
 
4 
                                         
 
pay the tax debt because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has designated the tax 
debt as uncollectible. (Tr. 47)2 Applicant is working out a plan with his accountants to 
pay the payroll tax debt. (Tr. 47) He said he has been working on the plan to pay the 
IRS for the payroll taxes since 2010. (Tr. 48) Applicant offered to provide documentation 
showing that he has been working with the IRS and State Y to resolve the tax debts. 
(Tr. 49) I requested that Applicant provide documentation showing he communicated 
with the IRS about payment plans. (Tr. 53) He did not provide any documentation 
showing proffered or approved IRS payment plans.

amount owed information:

2015 Nov. 17, 2016 ($10,782) ($436) (Y) 
 
At his hearing, Applicant said his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2011 
through 2015 are not filed;4 however, he said those five tax returns are in the process of 
being filed. (Tr. 51-52, 55) I requested, and he said he could provide evidence that state 
and federal filing extensions had been granted. (Tr. 52-55) After the hearing, he 
provided evidence that he requested extensions for tax year 2013 on April 5, 2014, for 
tax year 2013; on April 15, 2015, and for tax year 2014; on January 31, 2016 for tax 
                                            
2He did not provide his tax returns, and the amount of his adjusted gross income for tax years 
2010 through 2015 is not part of the record evidence. Thus, it is not possible to address whether he had 
the ability to establish a payment plan to address the $213,857 tax debt listed in Schedule E of his 2015 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
 
3Applicant provided information from his accountant showing his tax returns for tax years 2010, 
2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were prepared on November 17, 2016. (AE S-AE AD) In a post-hearing 
email, Applicant said he filed his federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2015, and he provided 
information about the taxes owed or to be refunded, which has been included in this table. I have credited 
Applicant with filing his state and federal tax returns for 2010 through 2015 around November 17, 2016.  
 
4Section 26 of Applicant’s September 26, 2014 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 
86) or security clearance application (SCA), asked “In the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or 
pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?” (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) 
Applicant answered, “No.” (GE 1) Applicant was not confronted with his failure to disclose information 
about his taxes at his hearing, and this issue will not be used against him for any purpose in this decision.

year 2015.5 (AE Q) Generally, filing an extension for taxpayers residing inside the 
United States results in an extension limited to six months after the April 15 due date 
following the tax year, and the six-month extensions are automatic.6    
 
Character Evidence 
 
A colleague from work described Applicant as a person of good character. 
Applicant is patriotic, energetic, loyal, and reliable. (AE A)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
                                            
5Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax 
years 2010 through 2015. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board 
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). 
Consideration that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 
2015 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.

6 
                                         
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
7 
                                         
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and 
“(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” Based on the information in the SOR, AG ¶ 19(g) is not 
established. The record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
8 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important positive financial information. Applicant was unemployed; he lost money while 
seeking public office; and he suffered from cancer. While receiving cancer treatments, 
he was unable to work, and he generated medical bills. In November 2016, Applicant 
filed his federal tax returns for 2010 through 2015. He acknowledged his delinquent 
debts, and he said he intends to pay his debts.    
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.8 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax 
returns against him as a federal crime. See also note 5, supra. 
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. Applicant’s 
bankruptcy filing indicates Applicant has owed $213,857 in federal and state taxes since 
2010. In addition, the record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal 
and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2015. The DOHA Appeal Board 
has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
                                            
8Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  
make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times 
required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be 
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
9 
                                         
 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S.

at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. 
June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversal: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government 
rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.

ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
The negative financial and judgment information in Applicant’s case is significant. 
The record established that Applicant has owed $213,857 in federal and state taxes 
since 2010. He did not disclose any payments to address this tax debt. In addition, 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 
through 2015. His explanations are insufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 49 years old, and he has worked as a sales account executive on an 
intelligence community team starting in September 2016. His base salary is $125,000 
with another $125,000 possible incentive bonus. From 2007 to 2012, he held a security 
clearance; in 2010, Applicant completed two security courses; and there is no evidence 
of security violations.  
 
Circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances including: lack 
of income while he pursued political office; funds in his company were misused while he 
ran for political office; he was unemployed for a lengthy period in 2016; and he suffered 
from cancer, which necessitated time off from work and medical expenses. After his 
debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, he has not accrued 
any additional delinquent debt. Applicant has a membership in multiple civic 
organizations. A colleague from work described Applicant as a person of good 
character, who is patriotic, energetic, loyal, and reliable.

Applicant has owed $213,857 in federal and state taxes since 2010. In addition, 
the record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2010 through 2015. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative 
judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, 
whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax 
debt arises to begin and complete making payments.9 The primary problem here is that 
Applicant waited several years (until November 2016) to file all required federal and 
state tax returns, and he has owed substantial state and federal tax debts since 2010.    
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
  
                                            
9The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security 
clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking 
action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has 
rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of 
someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
