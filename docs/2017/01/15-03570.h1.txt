LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
On November 16, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on December 1, 2015, and elected to have the 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government’s written case 
was submitted on March 9, 2016. Applicant responded with a series of documents. The 
case was assigned to me on November 2, 2016. On December 16, 2016, I proposed to 
the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. 
Department Counsel did not object.  
 
The SOR alleges five medical debts and charged-off first and second mortgage 
loans. Applicant paid the medical debts, and the mortgage loans were resolved by a 
short sale with no evidence of a deficiency. Her current finances are sound. Based on 
 
2 
 
the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that the security concerns are mitigated 
under the following mitigating conditions: AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d).  
 
The concerns over Applicant’s history of financial problems do not create doubt 
about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect 
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also 
gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she 
met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. This case is 
decided for Applicant.
