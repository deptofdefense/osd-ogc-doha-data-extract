GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 8, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On December 31, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to him, under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns

under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 13, 2016. On February 2, 2016, he 
responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing.2 A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to 
Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March 15, 2016, 
and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, 
to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on April 19, 2016. On May 16, 2016, Applicant’s attorney filed a 
Notice of Appearance in which he stated that Applicant had now requested a hearing.3 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on June 17, 
2016. The case was assigned to me on August 4, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on August 31, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 20, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 and GE 2, Applicant exhibits (AE) 
A through AE Q, and administrative exhibits I and II were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Applicant and four witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
September 28, 2016. I kept the record open until October 25, 2016 to enable Applicant to 
supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted various 
additional documents, which were marked and admitted as AE R through AE AE, without 
objection. The record closed on June 27, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, the factual 
allegations (¶ 1.a.) pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions and 
comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
technician with the company or its wholly-owned subsidiary since October 2002.4 He is a 
June 1977 high school graduate, with over three years of college training in electrical 
engineering, but no degree.5 Applicant has never served in the U.S. military.6 He has held 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated February 2, 2016. 
 
3 While Applicant’s attorney indicated that Applicant had requested a hearing, there is no document in the 
case file to reflect such a decision by Applicant.

a secret security clearance since 2003.7 Applicant was married the first time in June 1982 
and divorced in June 1996. He married again in September 1998 and divorced in March 
2009.8 Applicant has no children. 
 
Financial Considerations 
Based on the information Applicant entered in his 2013 e-QIP, as well as his 
statements during a July 2013 interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM), the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2011 and 2012.9 During the hearing, 
Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR, under the authority of the Directive, Encl. 
3, ¶ E.3.1.17, to conform to the developed evidence.10 The motion proffered was to 
replace the allegation in the SOR with the following: “You failed to timely file your federal 
and state income tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, as 
required.”11 There being no objection, the motion was granted and the SOR was 
amended.12 The evidence with respect to the federal and state income tax returns and 
their respective current status, according to evidence presented by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below: 
2009: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2010 filing deadline for his federal 
and state income tax returns for the tax year 2009, so he filed for an automatic extension 
until October 2010.13 He failed to file his returns before the expiration of that deadline. 
Applicant finally filed his federal income tax return for 2009 on May 23, 2011, about six 
months after they were due.14 He received a $3,716 refund from the IRS.15 The status of 
the state income tax return remains unclear and unsupported by any documentation. 
Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his income tax returns for 2009 to two factors: 
(a) his tax advisors advised him of the benefit of collecting sales tax receipts (like the 
sales tax he might spend at Burger King), utilities, and medical expenses, so he started 
searching for them; and (b) the collection of necessary documentation was very stressful

Judge on his or her own motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it in conformity 
with the evidence admitted or for other good cause. . . .”

and overwhelming, to the point that he considered it a phobia.16 Applicant also added an 
additional reason for his lackadaisical attitude towards the timely filing of his income tax 
returns: he generally files his income tax returns late and the IRS does not seem to mind 
his practice and has never penalized him for doing so.17 This portion of the allegation is 
substantiated. 
2011: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2012 filing deadline, so he filed for 
an extension until October 2012.18 He failed to file his returns before the expiration of the 
deadline. Applicant finally electronically filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
2011 on October 15, 2013, one year after they were due.19 He received a $4,265 refund 
from the IRS and a $1,944 refund from the state.20 In addition to the three factors 
described above, Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his income tax returns for 
2011 to one additional factor: his mother was hospitalized.21 This portion of the allegation 
is substantiated. 
2012: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2013 filing deadline, so he filed for 
an extension until October 2013.22 He did so by electronically filing his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2012 on October 15, 2013, the established filing extension due 
date.23 He received a $3,752 refund from the IRS and a $1,818 refund from the state.24 
This portion of the allegation is unsubstantiated. 
2013: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2014 filing deadline, so he filed for 
an extension until October 2014.25 He failed to file his returns before the expiration of the 
deadline. Applicant finally electronically filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
2013 on May 12, 2016, approximately 18 months after they were due,26 and about five

months after the original SOR was issued. He received a $3,745 refund from the IRS and 
a $1,923 refund from the state.27 This portion of the allegation is substantiated. 
2014: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2015 filing deadline, so he filed for 
an extension until October 2015.28 He failed to file his returns before the expiration of the 
deadline. Applicant finally electronically filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
2014 on May 12, 2016, approximately seven months after they were due,29 and about 
five months after the original SOR was issued. He received a $6,238 refund from the IRS 
and a $3,917 refund from the state.30 This portion of the allegation is substantiated. 
2015: Applicant was unable to meet the April 2016 filing deadline, so he filed for 
an extension until October 2016.31 He did so by electronically filing his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2015 on May 12, 2016, well before the established filing extension 
due date.32 He received a $5,831 refund from the IRS and a $3,980 refund from the 
state.33 This portion of the allegation is unsubstantiated. 
Applicant claims that he has learned from his earlier practices. He now 
acknowledges that the degree of detail he was seeking to achieve was unnecessary, and 
he was overwhelmed by it. He intends to simplify his efforts in the future, and he will be 
submitting the bare minimum documentation to his professional tax advisors. He is no 
longer distracted by his mother’s poor health because she passed away in January 2016. 
He claims he has accepted the idea of filing his income tax returns on time.34 While not 
focusing on his income tax returns, but rather on debt resolution, Applicant noted that he 
listens to the Dave Ramsey radio show and took a course about becoming debt free.35 
Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement, dated October 3, 2016, in 
which he reflected a net monthly income of $2,311.36; monthly expenses totaling $1,968; 
and a monthly remainder of $343.36 available for savings or investing. He has bank 
savings of $318,519; and miscellaneous cash assets, including a 401(k), and Individual 
Retirement Account (IRA), and an inheritance with a combined value of $257,505.36 
Applicant’s recent credit reports listed some previously negative accounts or minor

being resolved.37  
Work Performance and Character References 
Applicant’s direct supervisor (and corporate Operations Manager) considers 
Applicant to be a very conscientious detail-oriented individual who does a very good job. 
He noted that Applicant hates paperwork, and that he sometimes goes overboard in trying 
to be too detail-oriented. He considers Applicant to be reliable.38 Applicant’s performance 
appraisals for the periods 2009 through 2015, signed by the supervisor, generally reflect 
an employee whose overall rating is “commendable,” meaning he periodically exceeds 
requirements of the job.39 On two consecutive periods (2012-2013), his overall rating was 
“outstanding,” meaning he consistently exceeds job requirements in all key areas.40 
Regardless of the overall rating, Applicant was consistently rated “outstanding” as to his 
attention to detail, and with one exception, “commendable” as to his timely completion of 
tasks. The one exception was when he was rated “acceptable” in 2009. Applicant’s earlier 
performance appraisals, covering the periods 2003-2008, purportedly were more 
reflective of an “outstanding” (four times during the period) performer.41 Applicant 
received an end of year bonus in 2014.42 
The corporate Business Administrator and Facility Security Officer (FSO) has 
known and worked with Applicant for 16 years. They have daily contact. Applicant is 
considered an excellent worker, he is well-liked, and is trusted. As FSO, he is aware of 
Applicant’s income tax return issues, but he does not consider Applicant’s timely filing 
“oversight” to constitute a security risk sufficient to deny him access to classified 
material.43 Another coworker who has known Applicant for 11 months considers him to 
be a very dependable, detailed, and trustworthy individual.44

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”45 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”46   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship

47 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”49  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. . . . 
The guideline notes one particular condition that could raise security concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(g), security concerns may be raised when there is a “failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.” 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 
2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014, as required by law. AG ¶ 19(g) applies.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
                                                          
49 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
50 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
9 
                                      
 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c).  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. The issue with 
Applicant’s income tax returns occurred frequently over a multi-year period, with his most 
recent episode being resolved on May 12, 2016 when he finally electronically filed his 
federal and state income tax returns for 2014. As noted above, Applicant attributed his 
failure to timely file his income tax returns for most of the period in question to the following 
factors: (a) his tax advisors advised him of the benefit of collecting sales tax receipts (like 
the sales tax he might spend at Burger King), utilities, and medical expenses, so he 
started searching for them; (b) the collection of necessary documentation was very 
stressful and overwhelming, to the point that he considered it a phobia; and (c) he 
generally files his income tax returns late and the IRS does not seem to mind his practice 
and has never penalized him for doing so. For part of the time, he added his mother’s 
poor health as a distraction from attending to his income tax returns.  
 
Applicant’s heavy emphasis on his self-proclaimed phobia surrounding the 
gathering of documents is difficult to accept. In reality, over a multi-year period, Applicant 
exhibited a lackadaisical attitude towards the timely filing of his income tax returns. 
Furthermore, to the extent there were some problems, it is difficult to conclude that they 
were largely beyond Applicant’s control, or that Applicant acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.  While Applicant has listen to Dave Ramsey and taken a course on debt 
resolution, nothing described by Applicant links such training to income tax return filings. 
Finally, it remains unclear if Applicant has actually embraced the paradigm of timely filing 
federal and state income tax returns, especially when his failure to do so is casually 
referred to as giving the Government an interest-free loan every year as far back as 2009.  
 
A willful failure to timely file a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level 
federal criminal offense.51 For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s 
failure to timely file his federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime.  
 
                                                          
51Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, 
keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without regard to 
existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th 
Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

The record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state 
income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014. The DOHA Appeal 
Board has commented:52 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
In failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 
2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014, Applicant appears to have acted imprudently and 
irresponsibly. Applicant’s actions, or inactions, under the circumstances confronting him, 
continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.53 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
                                                          
 
52 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 
25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, 
does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course 
of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).

and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.54       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. He is a well-thought of employee and coworker, and he 
has an excellent reputation in the workplace. Applicant’s financial problems were 
associated with his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax 
years 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014. He eventually filed those income tax returns, but it 
sometimes took him months or years to do so. He does not have any delinquent accounts. 
Applicant’s net monthly income leaves him with a substantial monthly remainder available 
for discretionary savings or spending.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. As noted above, Applicant’s explanations for his repeated multi-year failure 
to comply with the law related to the timely filing his federal and state income tax returns 
are interesting, but not persuasive. Moreover, it appears that the one significant reason 
for his inattention to his legal obligation with regard to timely filing his income tax returns, 
was the fact that he had done so repeatedly and there was no blowback or penalties from 
the IRS. Applicant acted imprudently and irresponsibly. His actions, or inactions, under 
the circumstances confronting him, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
amended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:    Against Applicant    
  
                                                          
54 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2006).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
