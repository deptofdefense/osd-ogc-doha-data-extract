BORGSTROM, Eric H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 27, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on March 2, 2016, and he elected to have the 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 30, 2016, the 
Government submitted its file of relevant material (FORM) and provided a complete 
copy to Applicant. Applicant received the FORM on April 6, 2016. Applicant was 
afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM within 30 days of its receipt and to file 
 
2 
 
objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.  
He did not provide any response. The case was assigned to me on December 5, 2016.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
In the FORM, Department Counsel references FORM Items 1-5. FORM Items 1 
and 2, consisting of the SOR and Applicant’s response to the SOR, are pleadings and 
are entered into the administrative record. FORM Item 4 is an unauthenticated summary 
of a June 10, 2014 interview with a government background investigator. In the FORM, 
Department Counsel advised Applicant that he could object to FORM Item 4 and it 
would not be admitted, or that he could make corrections, additions, deletions, and 
update the document to make it accurate. Applicant was informed that his failure to 
respond to the FORM or to raise any objections could be constituted as a waiver, and 
the evidence would be considered by me. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM, and 
he raised no objections.1 Therefore, I admitted the Government Exhibits, identified as 
FORM Items 3-5,2 without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 1980. From 
November 2006 to November 2014, he was employed by a DOD contractor. After two 
months of unemployment, Applicant worked in retail sales from January 2015 to 
October 2015. Since October 2015, he has been employed by the previous DOD 
contractor.3 During his security interview, Applicant noted that his income was 
significantly reduced in about 2008 when his employer reduced his overtime 
opportunities.4   
 
 Applicant has been married to his second wife since October 2007. He was 
previously married from 1996 to 2002. Applicant has three adult stepchildren from his 
second marriage, and none of these stepchildren resides with him and his wife.5 
 
 The SOR alleges 7 medical collections, 2 utility debts, 1 unpaid judgment, and 16 
delinquent consumer debts, totaling $28,351. In his response to the SOR, Applicant 
                                                          
1 See ISCR Case No. 15-05252 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2016)(Applicant’s waiver of the authentication 
element must be knowing and intelligent.  The Judge’s exclusion of the Report of Interview, containing 
mitigating evidence, was found to be error following applicant’s appeal.).  See also ISCR Case No. 14-
06781 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2016)(By not responding to the Government’s FORM, “Applicant waived 
any objection he might have had to this document.”).

this document consists of 12 pages.

admitted all of the alleged debts, except for the three accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r., 
1.s., and 1.t.6   
 
 During his June 2014 security interview, on his October 2015 security clearance 
application, and in his March 2016 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged 
debts and expressed an intent to pay these delinquent accounts; however, he provided 
no evidence of any payments or steps taken to resolve them.7 All 25 alleged debts are 
listed on Applicant’s May 2014 credit report, which shows that these debts became 
delinquent over a period spanning September 2007 to April 2014:

In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r., 1.s., and 
1.t., claiming that there was only one debt and that it had been paid.9 Applicant provided 
no documentation to corroborate this claim.  
   
 Applicant’s financial problems arose from his reduced income in about 2008, 
when his overtime opportunities decreased.10 He further explained that he had two 
surgeries – in about 2010 and 2012 – which, while mostly covered by health insurance, 
caused him to incur some additional expenses.11 Applicant did not provide any 
information about his income reduction, his current monthly income and expenses, debt 
counseling, or other steps taken to resolve the 25 alleged debts. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
                                                          
9 Item 2. 
 
10 Item 4. 
 
11 Item 2.

grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
  
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 The 25 alleged debts, which became delinquent between 2007 and 2014, total 
approximately $28,351. Accordingly, the evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
 The Government established a case for disqualification.  Accordingly, the burden 
shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.12 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of 
disproving it never shifts to the Government.13 Conditions that could mitigate the 
financial considerations security concerns are provided under AG ¶ 20. The following 
are potentially applicable:  
 
                                                          
12 Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
13 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing and the reduced overtime 
opportunities remain. Moreover, there is no evidence that Applicant has taken any steps 
to resolve or repay the 25 alleged debts. As a result, doubts remain as to Applicant’s 
good judgment and financial responsibility. Thus, AG ¶ 20(a) is not applicable. 
 
The application of AG ¶ 20(b) requires both (1) Applicant’s financial indebtedness 
resulted from circumstances beyond his control and (2) Applicant acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.14 Applicant provided limited information about his reduced 
overtime opportunities and his two surgeries. Nonetheless, because Applicant’s 
reduced income may have hindered his ability to address his delinquent debts, it may 
constitute circumstances beyond one’s control in the context of AG ¶ 20(b).  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that an applicant act responsibly under the 
circumstances. The second prong of AG ¶ 20(b) does not require an applicant to be 
debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously.15  
Here, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant acted responsibly to 
address his delinquent debts or to develop and implement a reasonable debt repayment 
plan. In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he no longer lives beyond his 
means and is financially responsible; however, he provided no evidence or 
                                                          
14 See ISCR Case No. 07-09304 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008). 
 
15 ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009)(“All that is required is that an applicant act 
responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by 
‘concomitant conduct,’ that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.”).

documentation to show that he can pay his monthly bills.  Furthermore, he provided no 
evidence of a plan to resolve his delinquent debts or of any steps taken in furtherance of 
a debt resolution plan. Therefore, I conclude that AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply.   
 
There is neither record evidence of credit counseling nor record evidence, such 
as a monthly budget, to conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Rather, the absence of evidence of payments or 
other steps to resolve the alleged delinquent debts undercuts such a conclusion.  
Therefore, AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. 
 
Similarly, there is no record evidence of any payments made or steps taken by 
Applicant to resolve his delinquent debts. Therefore, AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply.   
 
To the extent Applicant disputes the legitimacy of the three collection accounts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.r., 1.s., and 1.t., he has not provided the requisite documentation to 
establish a reasonable basis for his dispute. Applicant has not provided substantial 
evidence to demonstrate that he is not liable for these three debts. Thus, AG ¶ 20(e) 
does not apply. 
 
Absent evidence of debt repayment and financial responsibility, I find that 
financial considerations concerns remain. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F and the factors in AG ¶ 2(c) in this whole-person analysis.  
 
 
8 
 
Applicant was provided an opportunity in his SOR response and in response to 
the Government’s FORM to show what steps he has taken to resolve these 
delinquencies, and to provide documentation. Applicant presented only limited 
information about his reduced income and circumstances that hindered his ability to 
address his delinquent debts, and he provided no evidence of any steps taken to 
resolve his delinquent debts.  As a result, the totality of the record evidence leaves me 
with doubts as to Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did 
not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.y.:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
