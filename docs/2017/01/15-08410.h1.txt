 Decision
  ______________
WESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding his financial considerations.
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.    
 
Statement of Case
On March 10, 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons
why DoD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a
security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine
whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The
action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by DoD on
September 1, 2006.  
2
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 19, 2016, and requested a hearing. The
case was assigned to me on August 12, 2016, and was scheduled for hearing on October
26, 2016. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5).
Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and eight exhibits (AEs A-G). The transcript (Tr.)
was received on November 3, 2016.  
Procedural Issues
Before the commencement of the evidentiary phase of the scheduled hearing,
jurisdictional issues were addressed regarding Applicant’s current employment status. In
the furnished Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) employment status summary
of October 2016, Applicant was documented to be separated as of May 31, 2016, and no
longer sponsored by his employer. (HE 1) An updated JPAS employment summary
confirmed Applicant’s employment by his new employer who is sponsoring him for a
security clearance, effective May 24, 2016. (HE 2) Jurisdiction over Applicant’s security
clearance application is established. 
Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to
permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with copies of his 2007 and 2011
installment agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) covering tax years 2007-
2011. (Tr. 55-56)  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement
the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. Within the time
permitted, Applicant furnished a copy of an IRS installment agreement (updated as to the
date of entry) covering tax years 1999 and 2001-2003. Applicant’s submission was
admitted without objection as AE H.
Summary of Pleadings
Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred federal tax liens against him:
one entered in 2011 for $9,731 and another in 2007 for $39,262; and (b) incurred a state
lien entered against him in 2006 for $2,622. Allegedly, each of these tax liens remains
outstanding.
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with
explanations. He claimed to have entered into an installment agreement in 2012 that
covers Applicant’s consolidated federal tax debts (years unspecified) for which he is
paying $250 a month as agreed for the past five years. He claimed he received
inadequate tax help from a non-professional. He claimed he first became aware of the
state tax lien covered by SOR ¶ 1.c when he received the SOR. He assured he will
promptly address the state tax lien.  
      Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 60-year-old woodworker/material expediter for a defense contractor
who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by
Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional
findings follow.
3
Background
Applicant has never been married and has co-habitated with another person since
September 1985, a period of over 30 years. (GEs 1 and 5; Tr. 43, 53-54) He has no
children. Applicant earned a high school diploma in May 1974 and has no reported higher
education credits. (GE 1; Tr. 54) He has never served in the military. (GE 1; Tr. 54) 
Applicant has been employed by his current employer since August 2013. (GE 1)
Previously, he was employed by another federal contractor (between August 2012 and
August 2013). He was unemployed between January 2010 and July 2011, after being laid
off by his non-government construction firm. He worked for another non-government
construction firm between May 2008 and December 2009 before being laid off. (GE 1)
And, between July 2005 and early 2008, he worked for another non-government
construction firm as a field representative before being laid off due to the recession. (GE
1) He estimated to have been employed for a number of months in early 2008 before
relocating to his current state and finding full-time employment with the non-government
firm noted above for the period of May 2008 to December 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 42)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant incurred two federal tax liens: one in 2011 for $9,731and another in 2007
for $39,262. (GEs 2-5 and AEs B and H; Tr. 34-36) The 2007 tax lien covered tax year
1999 and tax years 2001-2003. (AEs A-B and H) Because Applicant filed his 2003 federal
tax return late in 2007, he accrued penalties and interest of over $6,000 that were folded
into the 2007 tax lien. (AEs A-B) He attributed his tax problems to filing mistakes and
relying on the advice of non-professionals. (Tr. 52) He was not notified by the IRS of tax
errors in his older returns until 2007. (GE 5) By this time, his tax obligations for the
previous tax years of 1999 and tax years 2001-2003 had climbed to almost $50,000,
inclusive of imposed penalties and interest. (GE 5) 
In 2007, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS, but quit
making his required monthly payments in 2009 after he was laid off and could not find
work for over 18 months. (Tr. 47-49) Out of work between January 2010 and July 2011,
he did not make his agreed monthly payments for two to three years (Tr. 42), and his
installment agreement with the IRS lapsed. (AE B) 
After returning to gainful employment in July 2011, Applicant entered into a new
installment agreement with monthly payments of $250. (AEs C and H) Applicant has
made his monthly payments consistently over the past five years in accordance with the
terms of his 2012 installment agreement and is in good standing with the IRS. (AE H; Tr.
52) Because the accruing monthly interest on the running consolidated balance continues
to compound, Applicant’s credited $2,000 payments between February 2016 and October
2016 reflect only a modestly declining balance, enhanced by IRS removal of some
penalties in 2016. (i.e., from $48,620 in February 2016 to $44,011 in October 2016). (AEs
C and E; Tr. 51) 
4
Records show that Applicant paid $3,000 to the IRS in December 2001 and $3,485
in monthly payments between December 2011 and May 2012. (AEs B-D) According to
the payment balance provided Applicant by the IRS in October 2016, Applicant still owes
$44,011 in back taxes for the cumulative tax years of 1999 and 2001-2003.  (AEs C and
E) To assist him with addressing his back taxes for these years, Applicant engaged a tax
specialist in July 2011 and assigned her a power of attorney to deal directly with the IRS
in addressing his taxes owed for tax years 1999-2010 and establish an installment
agreement with the Service. (AE F) Attached to the power of attorney are November 2011
correspondence from Applicant along with supporting documentation in connection with
his revised 433-A application for an installment agreement with requested monthly
payments of $250.  (AE F) Applicant reported cash on hand of $337.41, personal assets
of $6,200, and monthly expenses in excess of $1,200. (AE F)
Besides his federal tax liens, Applicant incurred a state lien. (GEs 2-5 and AE G)
Records document that a state taxing authority filed a state tax lien against Applicant in
October 2006. (GEs 2-5; AE G) Applicant satisfied the state tax debt accrued in tax year
2006 in the amount of $2,622. (AE G) He documented the state’s release of its tax lien in
April 2016. (AE G) Applicant also satisfied the 2011 federal tax lien in full in January
2013. (GE 5) Applicant has not accrued any additional delinquent taxes from either the
state in issue or from the IRS, either for past tax years or future ones.  
Asked whether he could estimate the number of years it will take him to pay off the
owed federal taxes covered by his 2011 installment agreement with the IRS, Applicant
could confirm only the advice he received from the IRS to “just keep paying $250" to
avoid any defaults in his installment agreement. (AE E; Tr. 42) To the best of his
knowledge, the IRS has not applied any entitled refunds for subsequent tax years to the
running balance of the back taxes he owes. (Tr. 39) Applicant presently earns good
money with his current employer and is confident about his ability to make his $250
monthly payments to the IRS until the tax debt is satisfied. (GE 5)  He did not provide any
character references or evidence of community and civic contributions.
                     Policies
           The AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-making
process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into account factors
that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as
considerations that could affect the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information. These guidelines include "[c]onditions that could raise a
security concern and may be disqualifying” (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of
the "[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.” 
These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security
clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require
administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and
mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to
be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG ¶ 2(c).
5
In addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG ¶ 2(a) of
the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial
commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines
within the context of the whole person. 
The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an
applicant’s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is
an acceptable security risk. The following AG ¶ 2(a) factors are pertinent: (1) the nature,
extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.
 Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual
guidelines are pertinent in this case:
Financial Considerations
The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one’s means satisfy debts
and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate
funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial
crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known
sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds
from financially profitable criminal acts.  AG ¶ 18.
Burden of Proof
By virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding
that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive
requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence
accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a
security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that
evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  
As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences
which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the
judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.
6
The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial
evidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that
the facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain
a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or
abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,
the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or
controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of
establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,
or mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances
be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of
demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. “[S]ecurity-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” See Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
Analysis  
Security concerns are raised over Applicant’s accrual of federal and state tax
liens covering delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest for past tax years spanning 1999
and 2003. Applicant’s accumulated tax delinquencies for these years warrant the
application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the AGs: DC ¶ 19(a), “inability
or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and DC ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial
obligations.”
Holding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial
responsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.
Financial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required
precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. While the
principal concern of a clearance holder’s demonstrated financial difficulties is
vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are also implicit in
financial cases.
Applicant has made considerable progress in addressing his federal and state
liens since his return to full time employment in July 2011. Records document his
satisfaction of his state tax lien in 2013 and his compliance with the installment
agreement his tax preparer negotiated with the IRS in November 2011. Although his
progress in paying off the 2007 federal lien covered by his 2011 installment agreement
is slow, he has consistently met his monthly payment requirements and is in full
compliance with his IRS installment agreement. 
Applicant’s addressing of his federal and state tax liens of record reflects
substantial progress in paying off the liens of record and merit full application of MC ¶
20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the
7
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly
under the circumstances.” Financial hardships associated with his loss of income during
recurrent periods of unemployment and underemployment between 2008 and 2011 are
extenuating and sufficient to absolve him of any recurrent risks of accumulated tax
delinquencies at the federal and state level.
Applicant’s documented repayment efforts enable him to take advantage of MC ¶
20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts.” Prospects for his continued compliance with the monthly payment
conditions of his 2011 installment agreement are excellent and leave no doubts about
his ability to maintain his finances in good working order.
With his presented documentation of addressing his incurred federal and state
tax liens, Applicant is able to demonstrate the level of financial progress required to
meet the criteria established by the Appeal Board for assessing an applicant’s efforts to
rectify his poor financial condition with responsible efforts considering his
circumstances. See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).
Applicant’s repayment initiatives enable him to meet the Appeal Board’s stringent
requirements for demonstrating financial stability. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd.
May 21 2008); see ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007)(citing
ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000)); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4
(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).   
From a whole-person standpoint, Applicant’s demonstrated efforts to date in
addressing the federal and state tax returns covered in the SOR are enough to
overcome security concerns associated with his history of accruing delinquent taxes at
both the federal and state levels. Whole-person assessment is sufficient on the facts
developed in this record, even without endorsements and evidence of community and
civic contributions. 
Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant’s tax accrual of
federal and state tax liens and his documented efforts in addressing them are sufficient
to meet mitigation requirements imposed by the guideline governing his finances.
Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the allegations covered by
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c of Guideline F.
Formal Findings
In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:
