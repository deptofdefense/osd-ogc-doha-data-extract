KEYWORD:  Guideline F
DIGEST:  Applicant contends that she filed her tax returns and submitted copies of her filings. 
A review of the record, however, supports the Judge’s findings that Applicant provided proof of
filing her 2012 and 2013 Federal income tax returns, but did not submit documentation
corroborating her claim that she filed the other tax returns in question.  In Guideline F cases, it is
reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation corroborating the resolution
of their financial problems. Adverse decision affirmed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. 
On November 20, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis
for that decision–trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a decision on the written record.  On October 20, 2016, after considering the record,
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello
denied Applicant’s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact and Analysis  
Applicant, who is 36 years old, has been employed since 2011.  She failed to file timely her
2009 through 2013 Federal and state income tax returns.  In her public trust position application, she
explained that her failure to file was due to “medical, car, helping out family.”  Decision at 2. 
During her background interview, she indicated that she advised her employer that she was exempt
from having to file tax returns, when she knew that statement was not true.  She provided documents
showing her 2012 and 2013 Federal income tax returns were received by the IRS in January 2015. 
She did not provide proof that she filed her 2009-2011 Federal income tax returns or that she filed
her state income tax returns for 2009-2013.  In her response to Department Counsel’s File of
Relevant Material (FORM), she stated she filed all of her delinquent tax returns, she was working
with the IRS to pay all taxes owed, but she did not disclose the amount owed.  In her analysis, the
Judge concluded that pertinent mitigating conditions did not apply because Applicant failed to
provide proof that she had filed her Federal income tax returns for 2009-2011 or any of her state
income tax returns, and she did not provide evidence to show why she was unable to file her tax
returns in a timely manner.  
Discussion
Applicant contends that she filed her tax returns and submitted copies of her filings.  A
review of the record, however, supports the Judge’s findings that Applicant provided proof of filing
her 2012 and 2013 Federal income tax returns, but did not submit documentation corroborating her
claim that she filed the other tax returns in question.  In Guideline F cases, it is reasonable for a
Judge to expect applicants to present documentation corroborating the resolution of their financial
problems.  Compare, ADP Case No. 12-01251 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2014).
Applicant also contends that she had financial hardships, including medical issues, car
problems, and family difficulties such as the death of her father,1 but indicated that she was not using
them as an excuse.  Besides merely mentioning in her public trust position application and during
her background interview that she encountered financial hardships, Applicant neither provided
details about those hardships nor explained how they impacted her ability to file her tax returns in
a timely manner.  Under mitigating condition 20(b),2 a nexus or connection between a condition
beyond an applicant’s control and the applicant’s financial problem must be established for the first
1  Applicant disclosed the death of her father in her public trust position application, but did not previously raise
his death as a reason for her financial problems. 
2 Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 20(b) states, “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]”
prong of that mitigating condition to be applicable.  Compare, ADP Case No. 10-04539 at 2 (App.
Bd. Jul. 11, 2011) and ADP Case No. 06-19856 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2007).  Moreover, the
second prong of that mitigating condition requires that an applicant act responsibly under the
circumstances.  Based on the record evidence, we find no error in the Judge’s conclusion that
Applicant did not present evidence to show why she was unable to file her tax returns in a timely
manner and that mitigating condition 20(b) was not applicable in this case.
Applicant argues that she is a hard worker, a good person, and derives satisfaction from
supporting the military in her job.   In her response to the FORM, Applicant noted that she was a
asset to her company and consistently received awards for the quality of her work.  Even though the
Judge did not make specific findings about such matters, Applicant’s arguments are not enough to
rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they
sufficient to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.  See e.g., ADP Case No. 14-03541 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2015) and ADP Case No.
15-01270 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 2016).  Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations goes to
the heart of the Government’s need to ensure each person in whom it reposes its trust is reliable and
has the requisite good judgment.  Compare,  ADP Case No. 14-05409 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2016).
 Applicant’s failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns in a timely manner for five years
supports the Judge’s ultimate conclusion. 
     
The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness
cases is that is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding
security clearances: such a determination “. . . may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with
the interests of the national security.’”   See e.g., ADP Case No. 14-03541, supra,  at 3.  See also
Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013), cert. denied.
