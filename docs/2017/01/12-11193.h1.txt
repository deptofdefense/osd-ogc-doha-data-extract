Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for
access to classified information. She presented sufficient documentary evidence to
establish that she has made a good-faith effort to repay delinquent debts and her
financial situation is under control. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on May 31, 2012.  More than three years later on November1
15, 2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documents, some5
of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 This exhibit was misidentified as Exhibit 9 in Department Counsel’s written brief, while the exhibit described6
as Exhibit 8 in the brief (a credit report) does not exist. 
 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan7
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case.).
 See Black’s Law Dictionary, 1717 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9  ed., W est 2009), for a definition of waiver.8 th

(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR with a three-page
memorandum and supporting documentation on January 4, 2016.       
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so the case
will be decided on the written record.  On March 23, 2016, Department Counsel4
submitted all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  The5
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on March 31,
2016. She replied within the 30-day period from receipt of the FORM, and those matters
are admitted as Exhibits A, B, and C. The case was assigned to me on December 7,
2016.  
Procedural Matters    
Department Counsel’s FORM includes Exhibit 8,  which is a report of6
investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took place during the June
2012 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated as required under ¶
E3.1.20 of the Directive.  Department Counsel’s written brief includes a footnote7
advising Applicant that the ROI was not authenticated and that failure to object may
constitute a waiver  of the authentication requirement. In her response to the FORM,8
Applicant objected to Exhibit 8 due to lack of authentication. Her objection is sustained.
Accordingly, Exhibit 8 is inadmissible and I have not considered the information in the
ROI.

Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for her
job working as a data specialist for a federal contractor. She has held a security
clearance for many years. She has been employed by the same company since 1984
after completing high school in 1983. She married in 1985, and she was widowed in
June 2010 after 25 years of marriage. She has an adult daughter from the marriage.  
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged a history of financial problems or difficulties
consisting of several collection or charged-off accounts for a total of about $29,515. In
general, Applicant does not dispute the financial problems, and she attributes her
situation to her husband’s serious illness during 2008–2010 that preceded his death due
to liver failure in 2010. As a result, he was unable to work full-time, which reduced their
household income. She described her husband’s death as a life-changing event, and
she delayed addressing many bills as she was dealing with her husband’s passing.
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant presented documentation showing she
resolved five of the seven delinquent accounts in the SOR for a total amount of $12,894
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.e).  In particular, the documentation shows as follows: (1) she settled a9
$6,287 collection account for $3,143 in December 2015; (2) she settled a $4,841
collection account for $2,904 in December 2015; (3) a $3,069 charged-off account was
cancelled by the creditor in March 2014, the amount of debt discharged was $2,442,
and an IRS Form 1099-C was issued to her for tax year 2014, which she addressed
with her 2014 tax return; (4) she settled a $3,869 charged-off account for $1,405 in
December 2010: and (5) she settled a $6,244 charged-off account for $3,000 in
December 2015. Concerning the two unresolved collection accounts for $1,011 and
$4,194 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g), she explained that she could neither admit nor deny the
debts as they did not appear on a December 2015 credit report she included with her
answer. Likewise, neither debt appears on an April 2016 credit report she included with
her reply to the FORM.10
In addition, Applicant presented documentation showing she was approved to
refinance her mortgage loan in March 2016.  Her home, in which she has lived in since11
1997, had an appraised value of $263,000, she obtained a loan amount of $178,500 of
which $151,425 was used to pay off first and second mortgage loans, and she used
about $18,000 to pay off eight other accounts. A review of her most recent credit report
from April 2016 shows an improved overall financial situation, her open accounts are
current, and her Experian credit score is 690, which is rated as good.12

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme20
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.23
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 24
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant25
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant24
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 25
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  26
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
In analyzing this case, I considered the following disqualifying and mitigating
conditions under Guideline F:  27
AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).28
6
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic
financial history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. Her financial
problems appear to be the result of an over reliance on credit as well as the serious
illness and eventual death of her spouse in 2010. This life event encountered by
Applicant resulted in a reduction in household income and influenced the way in which
she attended to her financial obligations. She is now handling her financial obligations in
a mature manner. She resolved five of the seven delinquent accounts in the SOR, and
I’m persuaded she would have resolved the remaining two had she been able to locate
the creditors. Also, she was recently approved to refinance her mortgage loan, and
used the process to pay off $18,000 in debt. Taken together, the totality of
circumstances support a conclusion that Applicant’s overall financial situation is on a
favorable upward trend. She presented sufficient documentary evidence to establish
that she has made a good-faith effort to repay delinquent debts and her financial
situation is under control. 
Applicant’s history of financial problems does not create doubt about her current
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that she met her28
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
