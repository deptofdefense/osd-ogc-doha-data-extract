FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 20, 2013. On 
March 24, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. The adjudicative guidelines are 
codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006), and they replace the guidelines in 
Enclosure 2 to the Directive. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on April 15, 2016, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 20, 2016, 
2 
 
and the case was assigned to me on September 7, 2016. On September 9, 2016, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for September 30, 2016. On September 15, 2016, Applicant requested that 
the hearing be postponed due to a family medical emergency. I granted his request, and 
on October 21, 2016, DOHA notified him that the hearing was rescheduled for 
November 16, 2016. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 
1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection. 
I kept the record open until December 16, 2016, to enable him to submit additional 
documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through K, which were received 
without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 29, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions 
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 60-year-old combat systems electrician employed by a defense 
contractor. He received an interim clearance shortly after submitting his SCA, but he 
has never held a final security clearance. (Tr. 52-53.) 
 
Applicant married in July 1975 and divorced in May 1995. He has five daughters. 
He was paying child support of about $400 per month until about two years ago. All his 
children are now adults. His two oldest daughters have graduated from college. One is 
a police officer and the other is serving as an officer on active duty in the U.S. Army. (Tr. 
42, 47.) 
 
Applicant was employed by a non-federal employer as a network security 
engineer from July 1996 to March 2003, and unemployed from March 2003 to January 
2004. While working, he was earning $65,000-$70,000 per year. He moved to another 
state to be closer to his children, not realizing the economic consequences of his 
decision. (Tr. 47.) He was employed by a non-federal employer from January 2004 to 
November 2005, but earning only about $1,120 to $1,440 per month. He was 
unemployed from November 2005 to January 2006, and employed by a non-federal 
employer from January 2006 until he began his current job in February 2007. For the 
past two years, he has been earning about $4,750 per month. (Tr. 31-34.) 
 
Around 2007, Applicant decided that he needed more education to qualify for 
jobs that are more meaningful. He started by taking classes online and then attending 
classes off-duty while working full time. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in December 
2009 and a master’s degree in 2015. (GX 2 at 1; Tr. 31-33.) The student loans alleged 
in the SOR initially were deferred but are now delinquent.  
 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
3 
 
Applicant has a monthly net remainder of about $600 after paying his living 
expenses. He has only about $350 in savings. He has about $50,000 in his retirement 
account. (Tr. 36-37.)  
 
After obtaining his current job, Applicant paid off two credit-card accounts in 
August 2009 and August 2012. (AX D at 6; AX G.) He paid off his car loan in March 
2012. (AX C at 2.) He paid off his home mortgage loan in October 2015 (AX C at 3.) He 
paid off a student loan not alleged in the SOR in November 2016. (AX J.) He is currently 
making payments totaling about $500 per month on two other student loans not alleged 
in the SOR. (Tr. 49-50; AX B.) 
 
Applicant’s granddaughter recently suffered severe brain trauma in a car 
accident and is still recovering.2 He gave her mother about $12,000, borrowed from his 
retirement account, to help with medical expenses that are not covered by insurance. 
(Tr. 44-45.) 
 
Applicant’s credit bureau reports from July 2013 and April 2015 reflect a 
delinquent medical bill for $128 and several delinquent student loans. The evidence 
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a: medical bill, placed for collection of $128 in January 2010. 
Applicant paid this bill in July 2016. (AX H; AX I.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.f: student loans, placed for collection at various times in 
2012, for $4,165; $2,995; $2,472; $2,908; and $4,044. Applicant’s pay has been 
garnished since November 2014, at the rate of 15% of his net pay, to pay these loans. 
Currently, $149 per week is being collected by garnishment. (AX A.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h: two student loans, one charged off for $8,830 in 
November 2009 and the other charged off for $5,466 in April 2012. Applicant has 
contacted the creditor for both loans, but he has not yet arranged to resolve them. He 
intends to pay off his other student loans before beginning to make payments on these 
loans. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 43-44; AX K.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
                                                          
2 Applicant requested postponement of his hearing, originally scheduled for September 30, 2016, so that 
he could be with his granddaughter and assist in her care.

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit bureau reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
 The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
6 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established. Applicant’s drastic pay reduction in January 2004 was 
not a condition beyond his control, because he voluntarily decided to move to a location 
nearer his daughters without exploring or considering the economic impact of moving. 
The injury of his granddaughter was a condition beyond his control, but his decision to 
help defray uninsured medical expenses was voluntary. However, his periods of 
unemployment from March 2003 to January 2004, underemployment from January 
2004 to November 2005, and unemployment from November 2005 to January 2006 
were conditions beyond his control. He has acted responsibly by staying in contact with 
his creditors and paying off or making payment arrangements for several debts not 
alleged in the SOR, including student loans, several credit-card debts, his home 
mortgage loan, his car loan, and an old medical bill. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is established. Although Applicant has not sought or obtained 
counseling, he has made significant progress in resolving his delinquent debts, 
providing “clear indications” that his financial problems are being resolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). The adjudicative 
guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every 
debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has been systematically paying his 
student loans and other debts not alleged in the SOR since at least August 2009, and 
he has made considerable progress.  
 
Applicant’s pay has been garnished since November 2014 to pay several of his 
student loans. Payment of a debt through garnishment rather than a voluntary effort 
diminishes its mitigating force. ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010). 
However, payment of some debts by garnishment does not bar mitigation of Applicant’s 
financial problems, because his overall approach to his financial problems reflects a 
reasonable plan to resolve his debts, significant actions to implement the plan, and a 
track record of compliance with his plan.  
 
 Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
7 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearings. He is intensely 
devoted to his daughters and proud of them. He has voluntarily come to the aid of one 
daughter, the mother of his injured granddaughter, in spite of his limited financial 
resources. He has overcome significant periods of unemployment and 
underemployment. His delinquent debts were not the result of frivolous or extravagant 
spending; they were the result of his efforts to improve his qualifications for meaningful 
employment. I am confident that he will continue his good-faith efforts to resolve his 
remaining student loans.3 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude 
he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:    For Applicant 
 
                                                          
3 Administrative judges do not have authority to grant conditional clearances. ISCR Case No. 01-24328, 
2003 WL 21979745 at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003). However, If Applicant does not continue on his path of 
financial responsibility, it could result in future revocation of his security clearance. “The Government has 
the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent 
conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012).

Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted.
