Decision
______________
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  Applicant’s clearance is denied.1
On 7 October 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 3
March 2016 and I convened a hearing 27 April 2016. DOHA received the transcript 10
May 2016.
AE B establishes the chronology of his termination from employment in April 2016 because of this pending3
clearance adjudication.
AE A establishes that Applicant began thinking about retirement by May 2006. Applicant retired on 134
December 2007 (Answer). On 19 December 2007, the Government began an investigation into Applicant’s
misuse of a Government credit card, and the matter was referred for review and adjudication on 26 December
2007 (Answer). On 14 February 2008, the Government informed the Applicant of the results of the
investigation, noting that at the time of his retirement, his security clearance was terminated, but that Applicant
would have to address the findings of the investigation if he ever applied for a clearance with the agency.
Nevertheless, Applicant was awarded a personal services contract with the agency in September 2009, and
was employed within the agency as a contractor from September 2010 until his periodic reinvestigation, begun
in December 2012 (GE 1), was referred for adjudication and Applicant was denied continued access because
his existing background investigation was too old and his current background investigation had not been
scheduled for hearing (AE B).

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for 1.d. He is a 61-year-
old former employee of a Government contractor where he was employed as a budget
analyst from September 2010 to April 2016 (GE 1; AE B).  From September 2009 to3
September 2010, he was employed on a personal services contract with the U.S.
Government (Answer). He previously worked as a contracting consultant from January
2008 to August 2009. This is a periodic reinvestigation of clearances he has held since
at least August 1987, when he first went to work for the Federal Government.
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (GE 1-6) establish, nine delinquent
debts totaling nearly $246,000. Applicant admits eight of the nine debts, although he
disputes the amount of delinquent taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for
SOR debts 1.f-1.i. He denied the state tax lien at SOR 1.d because the state withdrew
the lien in December 2013 (Answer). He also admitted using his Government-issued
credit card for personal expenses, but denied that he had retired from Government
service because of it (SOR 1.j).4
The alleged debt consists of $800 in consumer debt (SOR 1.a and 1.e), nearly
$81,000 in state tax liens filed in January 2007, October 2012, and February 2014 (SOR
1.c-1.e), and over $164,000 in delinquent IRS tax debt for tax years 2008-2011 (SOR
1f-1.I). Applicant provided no evidence to show the current status of his tax accounts.
Applicant’s December 2012 clearance application (GE 1) reported that he was on
a repayment plan to pay unpaid state and Federal tax returns for tax years 2005-2006
and 2008-2011 totaling over $195,000. He discussed his tax situation during a February
2013 subject interview with a Government investigator (GE 6), disclosing that he failed
to pay his taxes in 2005-2006 and 2008-2011 and discussing SOR debts 1.a, 1.d, and
1.e, as well as some mortgage delinquencies. He stated his intent to pay debts 1.a and
1.e soon, but had not done so when the SOR was issued in October 2015.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted a July 2014 Notice of Federal Tax
Lien for tax years 2008-2012 totaling nearly $151,000. AE E documents that Applicant
Apparently, the house had been encumbered to help pay her medical expenses (Tr. 74).5

paid approximately $63,000 in state taxes from June 2010 to January 2016. He did not
provide similar documentation of his claimed IRS payments. In April 2016, Applicant
hired an enrolled agent to prepare his 2013 and 2014 Federal income tax returns (AE C,
E). He also filed an extension for tax year 2015 (AE D). He estimates that he owes the
IRS $30,000 for 2013, $30,000 for 2014, and $10,000 (Tr. 54-55).
Applicant cites a variety of factors for his tax troubles. He stated that except for
2013 and 2014, he always filed his income tax returns on time (with or without an
extension), he was just unable to pay what he owed. He was unable to pay his 2005
taxes when his sister died, and he took a retirement plan withdrawal to pay her funeral
expenses and to redeem the family home that she had been living in.  The early5
retirement account withdrawal had its own tax consequences for Applicant. In 2006, he
was unable to pay his taxes because he was paying for his son’s college tuition. In
2008, it was college tuition for both his son and his daughter. For 2009-2011, it was his
children’s college tuition and helping his ex-wife with her living expenses when she lost
her job, despite the fact that nothing in their divorce decree required that support. 
However, Applicant also acknowledges that from September 2010 until January
2016, when his access was revoked, he was a Form 1099 employee for his company,
meaning that he was essentially an independent contractor who was required to make
quarterly tax payments, because his employer did not withhold taxes. Initially, he failed
to pay enough taxes to cover his annual liability, until he eventually stopped paying
altogether (Tr. 67-71). As a result of his conduct, while Applicant would not incur failure-
to-file penalties, he would incur failure-to-pay penalties as well as interest. However, his
untimely 2013-2014 taxes would be subject to failure-to-file penalties.
Applicant’s current income is $3,400 monthly retired pay. He provided no budget
or evidence of credit or financial counseling. He acknowledged not being completely
responsible in addressing his tax issue (Tr. 26), and that he really did not have a good
reason for stopping his installment plan payments (Tr. 52, 56). He provided no work or
character references, of any evidence of civic or community involvement.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).6
¶19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (g) failure7
to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same;
¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that8

Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. According to the most recent evidence
in the case file, Applicant has over $69,000 in outstanding state tax liens, and nearly
$151,000 in Federal tax liens for 2008-2012, plus $800 in unpaid consumer debt. Most
of the debt has been pending for several years.   And the outstanding tax debt does not7
include his as-yet-undetermined tax liabilities for 2013-2015. Applicant’s tax debt for
2013-2014 will include failure-to-file penalties, failure-to-pay penalties, and interest on
an estimated $70,000.
None of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations apply. His tax issues
are both recent and multiple, and he has not demonstrated that they are unlikely to
recur as he has been failing to pay enough in estimated quarterly tax payments to cover
his expected annual liability since September 2010.  Furthermore, his tax problems are8
both due to circumstances beyond his control (family deaths and responsibilities) and
not (tuition expenses, ex-wife’s unemployment). In addition, Applicant was not fully
responsible in addressing his debt. His $800 commercial debt has been unaddressed
for more than three years since he first committed to paying it in February 2013. While
he appears to have entered into repayment plans for his state and Federal taxes, he did
not document that he had made the IRS payments and he did not show the impact of
his state tax payments on his debt. Moreover, he did not act to adjust his quarterly tax

payments once it was clear that they were insufficient to cover his liability.9
Applicant has not received any credit or financial counseling, and although his
state taxes have been partially resolved to date, he has not shown the current status of
either his state or Federal tax accounts.  Applicant has stated what his enrolled agent10
thinks his tax situation is for 2013-2014, but there is no evidence of the IRS’s view of his
taxes. Better documentation of his contacts with the state and IRS could be considered
a good-faith effort to address his taxes,  But while it is understandable, if not entirely11
excusable, that his installment payments stopped when his access was revoked in
January 2016, he is not without significant monthly income regardless, and he has not
documented any effort to establish a new repayment plan within his current income
beyond finally acting to file his delinquent 2013-2014 income tax returns. Applicant is in
a sort of limbo until he can either obtain employment that does not require a clearance
or to establish a repayment within his current, lower income. Nevertheless, it is clear
that he is unable to establish a track record sufficient to conclude that his security-
significant conduct is behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
