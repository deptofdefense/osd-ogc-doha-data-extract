LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He failed to file state and federal individual income tax 
returns on a timely basis for tax years 2007-2013, and only recently filed those returns 
in April 2015. He owes nothing to the state, but he owes the IRS about $13,000 in 
interest and penalties, which he started repayment of in October 2016 at the rate of 
$185 monthly. His tax problems are too much, went on too long, and are too recent to 
justify a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, this case is decided against 
Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on July 28, 2014. This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on November 2, 2015, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
 
2 
 
information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on December 15, 2015, and he requested a hearing.  
 
The case was assigned to an administrative judge on April 1, 2016, reassigned to 
another judge in June 2016, and then reassigned to me on June 17, 2016. The hearing 
was held as scheduled on September 8, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1-
5, and they were admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits A-
M, and they were admitted. The transcript of hearing (Tr.) was received on September 
16, 2016.  
 
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to present additional 
documentation. On October 7, 2017, Applicant’s counsel submitted additional 
documentation marked as Supplemental Exhibits 1-29. Those matters are admitted, 
without objection, collectively as Exhibit N.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 60-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for his job 
as a senior systems engineer (with a specialty in software safety) for a company doing 
business in the defense industry. He has worked for this company or its predecessors-
in-interest since 1983. He has held a security clearance for many years while working in 
the defense industry. He has a good record of employment.2 His employment history 
includes honorable service in the U.S. military, both on active duty and in a state 
national guard. He earned a bachelor’s degree in information systems in 1991. His 
current annual salary is about $111,000, while his spouse earns about $40,000 annually 
as a public school teacher.   
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the SOR allegations concern four 
items: (1) Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999 and was granted a 
discharge in 2000; (2) indebtedness to the IRS for back taxes, interest, and penalties for 
tax years 2007-2013 in the amount of about $27,000; (3) an unpaid $6,262 charged-off 
consumer account; and (4) an unpaid $260 medical collection account.3 He admitted 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in 
the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).  
 
2 Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, G, and M.  
 
3 The Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and the two delinquent accounts are decided in Applicant’s favor for the 
following reasons. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was related to Applicant’s separation and divorce, and 
it is now more than 15 years in the distant past. The $6,262 charged-off account was incurred years ago 
in about 2006, and it is now essentially uncollectable as Applicant cannot find the owner of the debt. Tr. 
59-65. Applicant provided detailed testimony to persuade me that the $260 medical collection account 
was paid. Tr. 65-66.

that he failed to timely file state and federal individual income tax returns for multiple tax 
years, 2007—2013, and failed to pay state and federal income taxes when due during 
those years.4 To date, Applicant filed the late state and federal tax returns in April 2015; 
he paid about $784 to resolve his total indebtedness to the state tax authority over the 
course of several months in 2015; he paid about $21,562 in back taxes owed to the IRS 
in April 2015; and he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in September 
2016 to make $185 monthly payments to resolve approximately $13,000 in interest and 
penalties.5 His history of tax problems is discussed further below.  
 
 Applicant traces his history of tax problems back to early 2008, when he realized 
that he did not have sufficient funds to pay federal income taxes due for tax year 2007.6 
As a result, he did not file returns for tax year 2007. He hoped to remedy the situation in 
tax year 2008, but that did not occur, and the failure to file and the failure to pay 
persisted through tax year 2013. At the time this started, Applicant and has wife had 
four teenage boys under their care, their own two sons and two others (brothers) who 
they took in during Christmas 2007 and remained in their household through about 
2010, for a total of about two years. The increased size of his household was a factor in 
his inability to pay the income taxes when due.   
 
 In early 2015, Applicant began taking action to address his tax problems by 
retaining the services of a certified public account (CPA) – tax attorney.7 With 
professional assistance, Applicant filed the late state and federal returns in April 2015. 
He obtained a loan from his 401(k) account, and he used the proceeds to pay the back 
taxes owed to the IRS, the total indebtedness owed to the state, the fee for the 
professional services, and some money was used for home repair.8 In addition, he 
timely filed returns for tax year 2014 and paid all taxes due. Thereafter, in September 
2016, he entered into the installment agreement, noted above, with the IRS. Although 
the agreement calls for payments over a period of many months, his plan is to pay off 
the total indebtedness by obtaining another loan from his 401(k) account in January 
2017.9  
                                                          
4 Although the SOR allegation is limited to indebtedness to the IRS, Applicant, with the assistance of 
experienced counsel, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the timely failure to file and timely failure to 
pay income taxes matters. I considered the uncharged matters in order to put Applicant’s history of tax 
problems in context, because the failure to file and failure to pay for multiple tax years are relevant 
circumstances surrounding the allegation of his indebtedness to the IRS. I also considered those matters 
to evaluate his evidence in explanation, extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, and whether 
he demonstrated reform and rehabilitation. To do otherwise would result in a highly artificial piece-meal 
analysis of the record evidence. See ISCR Case No. 12-11375 (App. Bd. Jun. 17, 2016).

 Applicant had a financial counseling session in April 2016 for the purpose of 
reviewing his current income, living expenses, and assets and liabilities to assist him in 
evaluating his financial situation.10 He found the session useful because it gave him 
some insight into his financial situation and gave him confidence in his overall plan to 
address his financial problems.11 The paperwork from the counseling session indicates 
a positive monthly net remainder of about $975 and a net worth of $34,188. The 
paperwork is also largely consistent with a monthly budget he and his spouse use.12 
 
 Applicant made a good impression on me during the hearing. He was serious, 
contrite, and respectful of the process. Overall, I found him credible.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.13 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”14 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.15 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.16 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.17 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.18 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.19 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.20 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.21 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,23 the suitability of an applicant 
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information.24 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and

23 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
24 AG ¶ 18.

AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic 
financial history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. I have serious 
concerns about Applicant’s history of tax problems. Those matters have improved 
substantially from the past several years, but they are still not wholly resolved as he is 
at the beginning stage of paying off more than $13,000 in interest and penalties owed to 
the IRS. His history of tax problems requires close examination. Indeed, his ongoing 
indebtedness to the IRS and the relevant circumstances surrounding the indebtedness 
suggest that he has a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. 
 
 I have considered Applicant’s efforts to fix his tax problems, and his efforts are 
not insubstantial. He filed all the late state and federal returns in April 2015, which was 
before the SOR was issued to him in November 2015. Likewise, he paid the state tax 
debt and the back taxes owed to the IRS before the SOR was issued to him. He also 
implemented an installment agreement with IRS in September 2016 to repay the rest of 
his indebtedness over time, with the hope of paying it off early in January 2017. I also 
considered Applicant’s motivation, and I have no concerns that he is a tax protestor, is 
tax defiant, or is otherwise opposed to meeting his lawful tax obligations. I assess the 
situation as one in which Applicant exercised very poor judgment for a number of years 
due to neglect or procrastination or both. The result was a situation that began as a 
relatively minor problem with tax year 2007 and then snowballed over the years to a 
major problem, which he is still working to resolve. To sum up, Applicant’s tax problems 
are too much, went on too long, and are too recent to justify a favorable clearance 
decision.  
 
 Applicant’s history of tax problems creates doubt about his reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. In doing so, I gave 
substantial weight to Applicant’s many years of work in the defense industry and his 
honorable military service. Accordingly, I conclude that he did not meet his ultimate 
burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
 
7 
 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
