HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges an unpaid debt owed to the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) for $93,372. After he exhausted most of his SSA appeals, 
he settled and paid the SSA debt. Applicant timely filed all federal income tax returns, and 
timely paid all federal income taxes. Applicant does not have any delinquent debts, and 
he has a track record of paying his debts. He has been deployed to Afghanistan for more 
than four years, and he is currently deployed to Afghanistan. Financial considerations 
security concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On December 19, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On June 7, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
 
2 
                                         
 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On July 1, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
September 7, 2016, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On 
September 10, 2016, the case was assigned to another administrative judge, and on 
October 21, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On September 26, 2016, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for October 21, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered 3 exhibits; Applicant offered 20 exhibits; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted. (Tr. 34-42; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-T) 
Applicant objected to admissibility of his December 19, 2014 SCA, asserting it lacked 
relevance and contained unalleged derogatory information about his arrest for violation 
of a protection order. (Tr. 35-38; GE 1) I overruled the objection because the information 
in the SCA is relevant under the whole-person concept. Department Counsel did not 
object to the admissibility of Applicant’s exhibits. (Tr. 41; AE A-T) On October 28, 2016, 
DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. Two exhibits were received after the hearing, 
and they were admitted without objection. (AE U; AE V) The record closed on November 
1, 2016. (Tr. 114) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.c. (HE 3) I granted Applicant’s motion to amend his answer to SOR ¶ 1.c to partially 
admit and partially deny the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 123) He also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.  
 
Applicant is 52 years old, and a government contractor employs him in a 
construction-related specialty in Afghanistan. (Tr. 107; GE 1) In 1984, Applicant 
graduated from high school, and he has not attended college. (Tr. 107) He has never 
served in the U.S. Armed Forces. (Tr. 107) In 1990, he married; and in 2010, he was 
divorced. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) Appellant’s children are ages 16, 21, 24, and 25 years old. (Tr. 
106; GE 1) Applicant has been serving in Afghanistan since 2012. (Tr. 104) He had some 
brief breaks or leaves where he returned to the United States. He returned to Afghanistan 
shortly after his hearing. He is stationed on a large base, and the primary danger is 
indirect fire usually from rockets. (Tr. 108)

information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems were caused by a work-related injury in 1989, 
inability to work for several years, separation, divorce, and decline in the real estate 
market. (AE C; AE D) In 2012, he was deployed to Afghanistan, and he has earned a 
good salary while deployed in Afghanistan. He used the additional income to pay his 
debts and save money for any emergency that should arise in the future.  
   
Foreclosure 
 
 In August 2009, Applicant received notice that he was restrained from entering his 
residence because of disputes with his spouse. (Tr. 99; AE D, Ex. 1) In October 2009, he 
received notice of a pending foreclosure on his residence. (Tr. 99) Applicant gave a check 
for $1,360 to his adult daughter to give to his spouse to pay the mortgage, and she 
informed the police that he had violated the restraining order. (Tr. 100; AE D, Ex. 2) In 
November 2009, the divorce court judge ordered that the marital home be sold. (AE D, 
Ex. 4) In May 2010, the home was sold, and the mortgage company recorded a release 
of mortgage. (AE D, Ex, 6) On June 8, 2010, the mortgage company wrote Applicant that 
the mortgage loan was paid in full. (AE D, Ex. 7) The foreclosure was removed from 
Applicant’s credit reports at Applicant’s request. (AE D; Ex. 8)    
 
Filing Tax Returns for Tax Years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 
 
 Because of the August 2009 restraining order barring him from access to the 
records stored in his home, Applicant was unable to timely file a 2009 tax return. (Tr. 49) 
In 2009, Applicant’s spouse filed separately; she took all of the mortgage deductions; and 
she put his social security number on her tax return. (Tr. 49; AE A; AE B)2 In 2009, 
Applicant did not have any income;3 he contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); 
and the IRS informed him he was credited him with filing his 2009 income tax return. (Tr. 
49-51)  
 
In 2010, Applicant’s income was less than $100, and he believed he did not need 
to file a federal income tax return.4 (AE A; AE B) In March 2011, someone filed a false 
tax return in Applicant’s name, and received a $6,334 refund. (Tr. 54) Applicant did not 
receive the refund, and he was unaware of the fraudulent tax return until June or July 
2016. (Tr. 54-56) In September 2016, Applicant filed a corrected tax return for 2010. (Tr. 
55; AE A) In September 2016, Applicant filed an Identity Theft Affidavit, IRS Form 14039, 
with the IRS. (AE A) The identity theft is under IRS investigation. (Tr. 55) 
                                            
2Applicant thought her inclusion of his social security number on her tax return meant his tax return 
was filed; however, his spouse was required to place his social security number on her tax return to file a 
married filing separate tax return. See IRS Publication for 2009 Form 1040 at 15, 
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040--2009.pdf. 
 
3The income threshold to require filing a tax return in 2009 for married filing separately was $3,650. 
See IRS Publication for 2009 Form 1040 Chart A at 8, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040--2009.pdf.   
 
4The income threshold to require filing a tax return in 2010 for married filing separately was $3,650. 
See IRS Publication 17 for 2010 Form 1040 at 4,  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p17--2010.pdf.

Applicant has mitigated the allegations that he failed to timely file his federal 
income tax returns for tax year 2009 and 2010 because he had no income during those 
two tax years. (Tr. 50-52, 123; AE A; AE B) See notes 3, 4, supra. Because of his divorce 
litigation expenses, he was unable to afford tax help. (Tr. 69-70) 
 
 In 2011, Applicant obtained employment. (Tr. 57) In April 2012, he hired his cousin, 
who operated a tax return preparation business, to help him with his taxes. (Tr. 65; AE B) 
In 2012, he applied for the automatic six-month extension. (Tr. 59) He had some difficulty 
communicating with the IRS because he had a power of attorney, and the IRS did not 
want to discuss his tax return with him. (Tr. 60) In July 2012, he deployed to Afghanistan. 
(December 19, 2014 SCA at 9) In June or July 2016, he discovered that he had not filed 
his federal tax return for tax 2011. (Tr. 57) He obtained W-2s, and his 2011 federal income 
tax return was filed in July 2016. (Tr. 57) His 2011 federal income tax return shows: 
adjusted gross income of $28,289; tax of $3,193; withholding of $2,963; and amount owed 
of $230. (AE B, Ex. 4) He also sent the IRS a check for $230 in July 2016. (AE B) 
 
Applicant’s 2012 tax return was filed in 2013, and in October 2013, the IRS rejected 
his return because it had already been filed. (Tr. 59-60; AE B) In October 2013, after his 
2012 tax return was rejected by the IRS, Applicant gave a power of attorney to his tax 
accountant to get his tax return filed. (Tr. 67; AE B, Ex. 7, Ex. 8) He instructed his tax 
attorney to straighten out and file his tax returns and to file all necessary documentation 
on his behalf. (Tr. 67-69) In November 2013, his 2012 federal income tax return was filed. 
(Tr. 62; AE B)   
    
 Applicant’s 2013, 2014, and 2015 federal income tax returns were timely filed and 
paid using the same accountant that was supposed to take care of his taxes in 2012. (Tr. 
70, 104-107, 110; AE P; AE Q; AE T)5  
 
Combat Zone IRS Filing Extensions 
 
 The federal income tax return filing deadline for Appellant while he is serving in 
Afghanistan is as follows: 
 
[His filing deadline] is extended for 180 days after the later of the following. 
1. The last day [he was] in a combat zone . . . [and] Second, in addition to 
the 180 days, [his] deadline is extended by the number of days that were 
left for [him] to take the action with the IRS when [he] entered a combat  
zone. . . . If [he] entered the combat zone . . . his deadline is extended by 
the entire period of time [he] would have to take the action. For example, [if 
he] had 3 1/2 months (January 1– April 18, 2016) to file [his] 2015 tax return. 
Any days of this 3 1/2 month period that were left when [he] entered the 
combat zone (or the entire 3 1/2 months if [he] entered the combat zone by 
                                            
5The SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns in 2013, 
2014, and 2015. 
 
 
5 
                                         
 
January 1, 2016) are added to the 180 days when determining the last day 
allowed for filing [his] 2015 tax return. 
 
Example 1. Captain Margaret Jones, a resident of Maryland, entered Saudi 
Arabia on December 1, 2014. She remained there through March 31, 2016, 
when she departed for the United States. She was not injured and did not 
return to the combat zone. The deadlines for filing Captain Jones’ 2014, 
[returns is] figured as follows.  
 
The 2014 tax return. The deadline is January 10, 2017. This deadline is 
285 days (180 plus 105) after Captain Jones’ last day in the combat zone 
(March 31, 2016). The 105 additional days are the number of days in the 3 
1/2 month filing period that were left when she entered the combat zone 
(January 1– April 15, 2015).6 
 
 These extensions apply to civilians acting under the directions of U.S. Armed 
Forces in a combat zone.7 This same combat zone extension rule was in effect in 2012, 
when 2011 federal income tax returns were supposed to be filed.8  
 
 Applicant credit reports from TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian for 2016 
document numerous paid as agreed accounts. (AE F; AE G; AE J) Applicant has earned 
from $128,000 to $137,000 annually for the last three years serving in Afghanistan. (AE 
O; AE P; AE Q; AE T) He has a remainder of about $7,000 each month. (Tr. 71, 92) He 
has $97,000 in his bank account. (Tr. 72-73) His income has been stable since 2013. (Tr. 
92; AE O) It is evident from Applicant’s overall statement that he is not sophisticated about 
taxes and financial issues. He relied on others to help him navigate the tax system. He 
did not receive financial counseling.   
 
Social Security Administration (SSA) Debt 
 
In 1989, Applicant was injured while working on a large construction project. (Tr. 
52, 86) Some wet concrete struck him and injured his back. (Tr. 108) He sought and 
received SSA disability payments beginning in 1992. (Tr. 86) His spouse was designated 
at the representative payee. (Tr. 81) Applicant wanted her to handle their finances. (Tr. 
81) In 1995 or 1996, he returned to work, and then he entered into a five-year construction 
apprenticeship. (Tr. 53, 87) His spouse informed the SSA that he had returned to the work 
force. (Tr. 89) The SSA would not communicate with Applicant because his spouse was 
the representative payee. (Tr. 89) His spouse went to the SSA office; she advised the

SSA that he was employed; and the payments should stop. (Tr. 91) His SSA payments 
continued until 2007, when his SSA payments finally ended. (Tr. 53) The SSA payments 
were used for living expenses. (Tr. 91) He thought the SSA was making the payments for 
a valid reason that he did not understand. (Tr. 92) Once Applicant began working 
overseas, the SSA determined he could afford to pay the entire amount, including his 
former spouse’s share. (Tr. 83)  
 
SSA’s initial decision on Applicant’s request for waiver was on April 29, 2009. (AE 
C, Ex. 8) The SSA litigation, including appeals, reconsiderations, vacated decisions, 
remands, and additional decisions continues to date. (AE C, Ex. 8)9 
  
In 2011, Applicant’s spouse paid the SSA $6,334 when the IRS intercepted her 
federal income tax refund. (Tr. 63-64)10 Applicant was making token payments to SSA. 
(Tr. 77, 93) When he was deployed to Afghanistan his mail was not being forwarded to 
him. He was not receiving the SSA coupons and was unable to make payments. (Tr. 77, 
93) In June 2013, the SSA began garnishing 15 percent of Applicant’s gross pay. (Tr. 76) 
In February 2015, the SSA administrative law judge (ALJ) found that Applicant was 
without fault in his receipt of the SSA funds; however, the amount owed for May 1999 to 
March 2007 at that time was $118,898. (Tr. 85, 90; AE C, Ex. 8) As of February 2015, the 
amount owed the SSA was $90,977. (Tr. 77, 80, 84) The SSA ALJ found “recovery does 
not defeat the purpose of the [Social Security] Act, and [recovery from Applicant] is not 
against equity and good conscience within the regulatory definition. Therefore, recovery 
of the overpayment is not waived.” (AE C, Ex. 8 at 2) The rationale for requiring repayment 
is explained in the SSA Manual. See note 9, supra. 
 
In June 2016, Applicant contacted SSA because he wanted to settle the debt, and 
in August 2016, the SSA offered to settle his $64,000 debt for $52,000. (Tr. 74, 96-97; 
AE C, Ex. 9) At the time of the settlement, there was some confusion at the SSA about 
the amount owed and previously paid to the SSA. (Tr. 75; AE C) In October 2016, 
Applicant sent the settlement amount from Afghanistan. (Tr. 75, 78, 96; AE C, Ex. 19, 20) 
He is expecting to receive a refund of $5,900 when the amount is recalculated. (Tr. 75, 
98) An attorney advised Applicant that he could avoid payment of the SSA debt through 
bankruptcy; however, Applicant preferred to pay the debt and not have a bankruptcy on 
his record. (Tr. 79-80; AE C, Ex. 15) Applicant still has the possibility of receiving a refund 
from the SSA Appeals Council on a pending appeal. (Tr. 79, 85-86)      
 
  
                                            
9The Social Security Handbook explains the standards for requiring repayment of SSA 
overpayments. Social Security Handbook, Section 1914.4 states, “What happens when SSA receives a 
request for waiver? When we receive a request for waiver, all recovery actions stop until your request is 
either approved or denied and, you had the opportunity for a personal conference.” 
https://www.ssa.gov/OP Home/handbook/handbook.19/handbook-1914.html. 
 
10The judge handling the divorce allocated responsibility for paying half of the SSA debt to 
Applicant’s former spouse and the other half to Applicant. (Tr. 111-112) If one party pays more than half, 
they have a right to return to divorce court to seek a remedy from their former spouse. (Tr. 112)

Character Evidence 
 
 Two civilians, an Army captain, and a retired Army sergeant major served with 
Applicant in Afghanistan for up to three years. (AE E) They recommended approval of 
Applicant’s security clearance. (AE E) The general sense of their statements is that 
Applicant is diligent, “superbly productive,” technically proficient, professional, loyal, 
dedicated, reliable, and responsible. (AE E) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
 
8 
                                         
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) 
failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.”  
 
Based on the information in the exhibits and transcripts, AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) are 
established requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions in regard to his SSA debt. His mortgage debt was mitigated when the mortgage 
creditor wrote the debt was paid in full. 
 
Applicant filed his federal tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 after April 15, 
2012 and April 15, 2013, respectively, and his responsibility for the timely timing of his tax 
returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 is shared with his accountant and tax attorney. His 
tax professionals had a power of attorney to take reasonable actions to get his returns 
filed while Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan. He was the victim of identity theft, 
which delayed the IRS acceptance of his tax returns. All tax returns are filed, and all debts 
are paid or current.   
 
9 
                                         
 
Most importantly, AG ¶ 19(g) is not established because Applicant has timely filed 
his federal tax returns. He served in a combat zone from 2012 to present with several 
brief breaks or leaves to the United States, and he received an automatic 180-day 
extension each time he returned to the combat zone, which continues until he returns 
from the combat zone for at least 180 days.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;11 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
  
                                            
11The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
The following circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances: 
injury in 1989; unemployment; medical bills; underemployment; divorce; and the decline 
of the real estate market. Applicant’s SOR alleges an unpaid SSA debt for $93,372. After 
he exhausted most of his SSA appeals, he settled and paid the SSA debt. He paid his 
former spouse’s portion of the SSA debt, and he has a right to seek repayment from her 
from the divorce court. He has a pending appeal of his SSA debt. He does not have any 
delinquent debt.  
 
I have not applied a piecemeal analysis of Applicant’s finances and have reviewed 
his financial history including the SSA decision pertaining to his SSA overpayment. 
Throughout the litigation he has acted in good faith. He is acted in good faith when he 
requested and sought relief through the SSA appellate process before paying the SSA 
debt. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and 
employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of 
the SOR). Applicant’s explanations fully mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
 
11 
                                         
 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 52 years old, and a government contractor employs him in a 
construction-related specialty in Afghanistan. He has not attended college. In 1990, he 
married; and in 2010, he was divorced. Applicant has been serving in Afghanistan since 
2012 with short breaks for leave in the United States. He returned to Afghanistan shortly 
after his hearing. He is stationed on a large base, and the primary danger is indirect fire 
usually from rockets. Applicant has risked his life as part of his duties on behalf of the 
U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan. These circumstances increase the probability that 
Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist 
group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 
(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His over four years of past honorable service as a contractor in 
Afghanistan, and his desire for continued employment in Afghanistan weigh heavily 
towards approval of his security clearance.   
 
Two civilians, an Army captain, and a retired Army sergeant major recommended 
approval of Applicant’s security clearance. The general sense of their statements is that 
Applicant is diligent, “superbly productive,” technically proficient, professional, loyal, 
dedicated, reliable, and responsible. 
 
Circumstances beyond Applicant’s control adversely affected his finances 
including: his injury in 1989; unemployment; medical bills; underemployment; divorce; and 
the decline of the real estate market. Applicant’s SSA debt for $93,372 was settled and 
paid even though not all SSA appeals are resolved, and his former spouse has primary 
responsibility for half of the SSA debt. He timely filed all federal income tax returns, and 
all federal income taxes are paid.   
 
Applicant’s credit reports show numerous entries of pays as agreed. He acted 
responsibly by resolving all of his delinquent SOR debts. He assures he intends to pay 
his debts, and he understands the conduct required to retain his security clearance. The 
Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial 
cases stating: 
  
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
 
12 
                                         
 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment, 
and I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
