LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, 
and mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial history. 
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on July 30, 2012. This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on December 14, 2015, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG),

action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
He answered the SOR on January 27, 2016; he admitted the nine delinquent debts 
alleged in the SOR; he provided brief explanations; and he requested a hearing.  
 
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 3, 2016, and 
then reassigned to me on June 17, 2016. The hearing was held as scheduled on 
September 8, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1-5, and they were admitted. 
Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits A-W, and they were admitted. 
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to present additional matters concerning a 
particular debt, and that matter is admitted as Exhibit X without objections. The 
transcript of hearing (Tr.) was received on September 16, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 61-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for his job 
as a server administrator with a company doing business in the defense industry. He 
has worked for this company since 2008. He has held a security clearance for many 
years while serving in the military as well as while working in the defense industry. He 
has a good if not excellent record of employment.2 His employment history includes 
honorable service in the U.S. military from 1977 to 1997, when he retired as a senior 
noncommissioned officer (pay grade E-7). His current annual salary is about $66,000, 
and he receives military retired pay of about $17,000 annually.   
 
 Applicant’s educational background is extensive.3 It includes an associate’s 
degree in applied science awarded in 1992. After retiring from military service, he 
decided to pursue a new career in information technology. He earned an associate’s 
degree in information technology and computer network systems in 2003. He also 
earned a bachelor’s degree in information systems security in 2005. In earning his 
bachelor’s degree, he was recognized with membership in a prestigious national honor 
society.  
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the SOR alleged a history of 
financial problems or difficulties consisting of nine collection or charged-off accounts for 
a total of about $46,882. Applicant does not dispute his problematic financial history. He 
disclosed about $45,000 in delinquent credit card accounts in his July 2012 security 
clearance application.4 He provided additional information about his financial situation 
during a 2012 background investigation.5 To summarize, he has resolved or is the 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in 
the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

process of resolving six of the delinquent debts and three debts are enrolled in a debt-
repayment program and yet to be resolved. The status of each of the nine delinquent 
accounts is discussed below.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a--$8,200 collection account. This account is enrolled in the debt-
repayment program in the amount of $8,200 and is yet to be resolved.6  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b--$7,385 charged-off account. This account is enrolled in the debt-
repayment program in the amount of $8,123 and is yet to be resolved.7 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c--$3,199 charged-off account. This account was settled for $1,690 via 
the debt-repayment program.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d--$1,034 collection account. This account was settled for $414 via the 
debt-repayment program.9 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e--$3,995 unpaid judgment entered in 2011. This debt was paid in full in 
February 2016, and the satisfaction and release of judgment was filed in April 2016.10 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f--$7,600 unpaid judgment entered in 2011. This debt was paid in full in 
February 2016, and the satisfaction and release of judgment was filed in April 2016.11 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g--$5,073 collection account. This account is enrolled in the debt-
repayment program in the amount of $5,581 and it is yet to be resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h--$2,094 collection account. There was some uncertainty about this 
account during the hearing. After the hearing, Applicant determined that the account 
was not enrolled in the debt-repayment program; it had reverted back to the original 
creditor who elected to cancel the debt in the amount of $2,228 for tax year 2014 and 
issued an IRS Form 1099-C to that effect; he did not receive the Form 1099-C because 
it was mailed to an incorrect address; he has now obtained a copy of the Form 1099-C; 
and he will report the 1099-C as income on his tax returns for 2016.12

 SOR ¶ 1.i--$8,302 collection account. This account was reduced to a judgment, 
and the satisfaction and release of judgment was filed in June 2014.13 
 
 Applicant attributes his problematic financial history to unemployment after his 
retirement from the military. He was unemployed from June to September 2001; he was 
underemployed with a part-time job in a work-study program from November 2001 to 
April 2004 while he was a student; he was unemployed from July 2006 to September 
2006; and he was unemployed for about a year from February 2007 to February 2008.14 
He attributes the most recent period of unemployment as the primary circumstance that 
resulted in his financial problems.15 During that period of unemployment, he and his 
spouse relied on credit cards to pay for living expenses.16 He was underemployed in a 
minimum-wage job from February 2008 to September 2008, when he began his current 
job in the defense industry.17 His spouse lost her job working at a large grocery store in 
about 2008, and she has not worked since.18 
 
Applicant retained the services of a law firm in about September 2009 to assist 
him with a debt-consolidation program.19 They advised him to stop paying all credit card 
accounts, allow the accounts to go into default, and address the accounts when he was 
sued for collection. They did not inquire whether Applicant had a security clearance. He 
paid the law firm about $10,000 over the course of a year until about September 2010, 
the law firm settled one or two accounts, but otherwise did assist him when he was 
sued.  
 
The law firm referred Applicant to a local bankruptcy attorney for assistance with 
the judgments.20 Applicant had some initial communication with the bankruptcy attorney 
who was successful in delaying payment of the judgments, but communication 
thereafter ceased. He did not pursue relief via bankruptcy because he wanted to repay 
his indebtedness.  
 
In February 2016, Applicant retained the services of a debt-repayment 
program.21 As noted above, Applicant enrolled five delinquent credit card accounts for a

total of $26,603 to be resolved over a 40-month period.22 Two of the five accounts have 
been resolved to date for a total of $4,789 in resolved debt and three accounts are 
active and yet to be resolved.  
 
 Applicant made a favorable impression on me during the hearing. He was 
serious, contrite, and respectful of the process. Overall, I found him credible.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.23 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”24 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.25 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.26 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.27 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.28 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.29 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.30

clearance).

 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.31 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.32 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,33 the suitability of an applicant 
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information.34 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors as most pertinent: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.

 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His financial problems 
appear to be the result of an over reliance on credit as well as the loss of income due to 
unemployment and underemployment. His initial efforts to address his indebtedness 
were undercut by the questionable professional advice and services he received from a 
law firm. He has now resolved or is in the process of resolving six of the nine delinquent 
accounts in the SOR. The remaining three delinquent accounts are enrolled in the debt-
repayment program. The plan appears to be legitimate because it has already resolved 
two delinquent accounts. He is adhering to the monthly payments required by the 
program, and he should be successful in resolving the three remaining delinquent 
accounts, although doing so will take time.  
 
 Considering the totality of circumstances, I am persuaded that Applicant’s 
financial problems are due to circumstances largely beyond his control, and he has 
acted responsibly under difficult circumstances. I am further persuaded that his financial 
problems are not due to irresponsibility or lack of concern, although he could have been 
more proactive once his employment situation stabilized. My overall impression of 
Applicant is that he is a hard-working, responsible employee who found himself in a 
difficult situation. Finally, I am persuaded that Applicant will continue to adhere to his 
debt-repayment program, and that he will, in due course, resolve the three remaining 
delinquent accounts.      
 
 In addition, Applicant receives credit in mitigation because he voluntarily reported 
the information about his financial problems in his 2012 security clearance application 
and during the 2012 background investigation. He has also been truthful and complete 
in responding to questions about his financial problems. His willingness to self-report 
speaks well for his integrity, his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, 
and his overall suitability for access to classified information.  
 
 Applicant’s history of financial problems no longer creates doubt about his 
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In 
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the 
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. In doing so, I 
gave substantial weight to Applicant’s 20 years of honorable military service, which is a 
good indicator of his suitability for access to classified information. Accordingly, I 
conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information.

Conclusion

to grant Applicant access to classified information.
