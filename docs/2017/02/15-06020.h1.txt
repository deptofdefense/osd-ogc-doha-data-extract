HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges five delinquent debts totaling 
$28,978, and that he filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code on November 7, 2014. He also has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. He 
has not made sufficient progress addressing his delinquent debts. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is 
denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 6, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On May 15, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On May 24, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
August 10, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On August 30, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On December 21, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 
17, 2017. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered eight exhibits; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 16-19; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A-H) On January 24, 2017, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a through 1.e and the bankruptcy in SOR ¶ 1.f. He also provided extenuating and 
mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he intended to work for the government contractor 
as a background investigator. (Tr. 5, 8) In 1979, Applicant graduated from high school. 
(Tr. 5) In 1981, he received an associate’s degree in an electronics-related area. (Tr. 6) 
He has never served in the U.S. Armed Forces. (Tr. 6) In 1982, he married; in 1988, he 
separated from his spouse; and he is unsure if his divorce was ever finalized. (Tr. 6-7) 
Applicant’s children are ages 11, 13, 24, and 28 years old. (Tr. 7) Applicant’s partner lives 
with him, and she is a hairdresser. (Tr. 7) His partner has three children living in their 
home, and Applicant’s 11 and 13-year-old children live with Applicant. (Tr. 7, 24) Applicant 
and his partner do not receive any child support payments for the five minor children living 
in their residence. (Tr. 25; GE 5) 
 
Applicant worked in law enforcement since 1999. (Tr. 20) He also performed 
background investigations since 2000; however, he is not currently employed in law 
enforcement or conducting background investigations. (Tr. 8) In 2015, he retired from his 
police-department employment after 14 years. (Tr. 26) His monthly income from his police 
retirement is $4,500, and he receives about $2,500 monthly from two part-time jobs. (Tr. 
23, 26, 57) There is no evidence of criminal conduct, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal 
drugs. Applicant described himself as a person of good character, who is patriotic, loyal, 
and reliable. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems were caused by illness. In December 2013, 
Applicant had a back injury and was diagnosed with cancer. (Tr. 20, 27-28; AE C) In 
March 2014, he had surgery and received six weeks of radiation treatments. (Tr. 20; AE 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3 
                                         
 
D) After he used all of his sick time and vacation time, he was not receiving any income. 
(Tr. 20-21, 29; AE E) He did not receive any income from March to December 2014. (Tr. 
43) In December 2015, he was medically retired from law enforcement. (Tr. 20) The police 
department where he worked refused to pay workers compensation because his 
employer claimed his cancer was not work related. (Tr. 20-21)  
 
After several hearings, a judge determined workers compensation benefits should 
have been paid to Applicant. (Tr. 21, 30; AE A; AE B; AE F) His most recent 
correspondence regarding his workers compensation benefits was in April 2016, and he 
is still waiting to be paid. (Tr. 21, 30; AE B; AE F) On January 9, 2017, Applicant had 
another workers compensation hearing, and he said he received a ruling that he is 68 
percent disabled. (Tr. 31-32) Applicant may receive a substantial lump sum amount from 
the ongoing workers compensation litigation. (Tr. 61-64) He plans to use the lump sum 
payment to pay his debts, invest part of the money, and put some aside for the education 
of his children. (Tr. 63) 
 
Applicant reduced his expenses. (Tr. 22-23) He obtained a mortgage modification 
on his primary mortgage, and he is seeking a mortgage modification on his rental 
property’s mortgage. (Tr. 23) At one point, Applicant received foreclosure notices on both 
of his houses, and a BMW used by his security business was repossessed. (Tr. 40) On 
August 25, 2012, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy because his security 
businesses could not afford to pay workers compensation claims from employees. His 
security businesses were in addition to his employment with the police department. (Tr. 
35, 38, 40-41) In 2012 and 2013, he closed the security companies. (Tr. 42) The 
bankruptcy filed on August 25, 2012, was dismissed two years later on August 25, 2014. 
(GE 4)2 
 
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, bankruptcy records, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges five 
delinquent debts totaling $28,978, and he filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 
13 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 7, 2014. The status of the SOR allegations is 
as follows: 
 
                                            
2Applicant’s SOR does not allege four financial issues: (1) his 2012 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
dismissed in 2014; (2) he had a federal income tax lien for $10,298 filed in 2009 and released in 2010; (3) 
he is currently making payments on a $19,000 federal income tax debt for tax year 2012; and (4) he has 
delinquent student loan debts of $24,192. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the 
Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

four issues will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.  
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege collection debts for $100 and $279 owed to the same 
company. Applicant said the debts might be related to utilities. (Tr. 47-48) SOR ¶ 1.d 
alleges a collection debt for $78, and SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a telecommunications collection 
debt for $308. Applicant has not investigated or verified any of these debts, and they may 
not be paid. (Tr. 47-51) Applicant did not present any correspondence to or from the 
creditors for these four debts. 
      
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a $382,000 mortgage debt past due in the amount of $28,213. 
Applicant said this debt was the mortgage from his rental property. (Tr. 48) He decided to 
stop making most of his payments on the mortgage, and it is now more than $28,000 past 
due. (Tr. 69-70) He is receiving $1,450 in monthly rental income from a tenant. (Tr. 49) 
The current monthly mortgage payment is $1,600, and he pays $90 monthly for a property 
management fee. (Tr. 49) Applicant is trying to get a loan modification that will add the 
delinquent interest onto the principal of the mortgage. (Tr. 50) He plans to sell the rental 
property. (Tr. 64) He did not include the mortgage debt in his bankruptcy. (Tr. 70-71) He 
is keeping the rent and not paying the mortgage. (Tr. 71) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that Appellant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 
of the Bankruptcy Code on November 7, 2014. This bankruptcy plan required him to pay 
$470 monthly for 18 months, $1,200 monthly for 12 months, and then $1,920 monthly 
thereafter for a total of 60 months. (Tr. 43, 68) In March 2016, Applicant received notice 
that he paid the trustee $6,313, resulting in a $1,207 default through March 31, 2016, 
even though his payments were only $470 monthly. (Tr. 44, 69; GE 5) The most recent 
docket entry for the bankruptcy court shows on July 7, 2016, “BNC Certificate of Mailing” 
and “Request for Notice.” (GE 5) Applicant said he was able to convince the court to 
reduce the amount of his bankruptcy payments. (Tr. 45) He said he is current on his $470 
monthly bankruptcy payments for the Chapter 13. (Tr. 22, 45) He planned to ask the 
bankruptcy court to delay a planned increase in his monthly payments. (Tr. 46) Applicant 
received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. (Tr. 56) The budget filed 
with the bankruptcy court shows a negative monthly disposable income of $363. (GE 5) 
 
In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against Applicant for 
$10,298, and it was released in 2010. (Tr. 54; GE 2) Applicant conceded there were times 
when he was late filing his tax returns. (Tr. 54) He currently has an installment payment 
plan with the IRS. (Tr. 54) He is paying $339 monthly to address an IRS debt from tax 
year 2012 of about $19,000. (Tr. 55, 72)3 
 
Applicant listed four delinquent student loan debts totaling $24,192 on Schedule F 
of his November 7, 2014 bankruptcy filing. (GE 5) Two debts were last active on May 1, 
                                            
3Section 26 of Applicant’s March 6, 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or 
security clearance application (SCA), asked “In the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay 
Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?” (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) Applicant 
answered, “No.” (GE 1) Applicant disclosed his bankruptcies and largest delinquent debts on his SCA and 
the government was well aware of his financial problems. Applicant was not confronted with his failure to 
disclose information on his SCA about his taxes at his hearing, and this issue will not be used against him 
for any purpose in this decision.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
 
6 
                                         
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, 
bankruptcy records, SOR response, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides two 
disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in 
this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting 
financial obligations.” The record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
 
7 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some important 
positive financial information. Applicant had significant medical problems, and he was 
unemployed and underemployed. He lost money when his security companies were going 
out of business. He suffered from cancer, back, and heart problems. While receiving 
cancer treatments and recovering from surgery, he was unable to work, and he generated 
medical bills. He acknowledged his delinquent debts, and he said he intends to pay his 
debts. The decline in real estate prices reduced his ability to resolve his mortgage debt 
on his rental property.   
 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

Applicant had problems paying his federal income taxes, and the IRS filed a tax 
lien for $10,298 in 2009. He is currently making payments to the IRS to address a tax 
debt from tax year 2012 for $19,000. The Appeal Board has commented in the context of 
federal income taxes: 
 
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of 
those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and 
employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information).   
 
The negative financial and judgment information in Applicant’s case is significant. 
The record established that Applicant has owed federal taxes since 2012. He collected 
rent from a tenant and did not pay the mortgage accruing more than $28,000 in past due 
interest. His 2012 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed, and in March 2016, he was 
warned about the possible dismissal of his 2014 Chapter 13 bankruptcy because he had 
not made the required payments under his bankruptcy payment plan. His Chapter 13 
payments are scheduled to significantly increase, and there is insufficient assurance he 
will make the necessary payments. His explanations are insufficient to fully mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
 
9 
                                         
 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he plans to work for the government contractor as a 
background investigator. In 1981, he received an associate’s degree in an electronics-
related area. Applicant and his partner have five minor children living in their residence. 
Applicant worked in law enforcement since 1999. He has performed background 
investigations since 2000; however, he is not currently employed in law enforcement or 
conducting background investigations. In 2015, he retired from his police-department 
employment after 14 years. His monthly income from his retirement is $4,500, and he 
receives about $2,500 monthly from two part-time jobs. There is no evidence of criminal 
conduct, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs.   
 
Circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances including: 
medical problems; unemployment; underemployment; loss of his security businesses; 
and medical bills. Applicant described himself as a person of good character, who is 
patriotic, loyal, and reliable.  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling $28,978, and he filed for 
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 7, 2014. 
He is accepting rent from a tenant and not paying the mortgage on his rental property. I 
have doubts that Applicant will successfully complete his Chapter 13 bankruptcy because 
the payments are scheduled to significantly increase, and he has had difficulty making 
the payments in the past. His Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in 2012 was dismissed in 2014. 
 
The IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for $10,298 in 2009. He is currently 
making payments to the IRS to address a tax debt from tax year 2012 for $19,000. When 
a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an 
applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and 
how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making 
payments.5 The primary tax problem here is that Applicant has owed substantial federal 
tax debts since 2012.    
                                            
5The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4

It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he 
may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance 
worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
