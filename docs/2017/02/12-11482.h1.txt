Decision

RIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations 
concerns raised by his failure to timely file tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2010. 
He failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility. Access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2012. 
After reviewing it and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) on July 29, 2015, issued Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).1 
Applicant answered the SOR on September 8, 2015 (Answer), and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). 
 
The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2016. DOHA issued a notice of hearing 
on April 27, 2016, scheduling the hearing for May 16, 2016. The hearing was held as 
scheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and Applicant’s exhibits (AE) 1 
                                            
1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), implemented by the DOD on September 
1, 2006.

through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. AE 4-6 were received post 
hearing. On May 25, 2016, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. The record 
closed on June 22, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s response, he denied all the SOR allegations, except for SOR ¶ 1.c, 
which he did not admit or deny (but admitted part of the factual allegations), and SOR ¶ 
1.e, which he admitted. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information, and 
disputed the total debt owed on some of his delinquent accounts. Applicant’s admissions 
in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 53 years old. He started working for federal contractors in 2001. He 
has possessed a security clearance since 2002, when he worked as a security officer for 
a government agency. He started working for his current employer, a federal contractor, 
as a supervisory security specialist in 2007. Applicant has never been married, and he 
has no children. He completed high school and attended college for about two years, but 
did not earn a degree.  
 
In 2011, Applicant’s employer received a court order garnishing Applicant’s wages 
to pay delinquent taxes and student loans. The employer notified the DOD CAF via an 
“Incident Report.” The DOD CAF asked Applicant to submit his 2012 SCA. In response 
to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2012 SCA, Applicant disclosed that during the last 
seven years he had financial problems, including his failure to file and pay his federal and 
state taxes for tax years 2004 through 2010. Applicant explained:  
 
Prior to 2002 I had a perfect credit . . . . when the DOT.com bubble burst I 
lost my job and home. From 2002 till 2004 I was without a full-time job. I 
started a full-time job in 2004 but the financial damage had started. I had 
financially struggled with the death of my sister, grandmother, and 
stepfather, as well as me and my mother’s health deteriorating. My mother 
and I have been diagnosed with cancer. The past several years have been 
a low point of my life. This is the reason why I owe for my federal student 
loan, the IRS for back taxes, and a couple of creditors. I have already set 
up payment arrangements with the student loan (they take approx. 450 a 
month from my check and I am working with the IRS in resolving this matter 
for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 taxes owed equaling 
approx. 27000.00. I never financially planned for these family loses and 
health issues by I am stepping up to the plate to shore up my finances. I will 
not fail. I am determined to get through this financial hurdle. 
 
Additionally, Applicant disclosed he was delinquent on his student loan, bank 
loans, and other consumer accounts. He averred that he was in contact with his creditors 
and had established payment agreements with most of them.  
 
Applicant’s security investigation addressed his financial problems and revealed 
the SOR debts, which included a delinquent property tax debt to a county, a delinquent 
 
3 
                                         
 
student loan, failure to timely file his income tax returns for 2004 through 2010, a 
delinquent tax debt to the IRS, and 13 small delinquent debts. Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR response, his testimony, and 
the record evidence. The status of his SOR debts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant’s wages were garnished in 2011 to pay $190.60 in 
delinquent property taxes to a county. Applicant paid the debt and it is resolved.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant’s wages were garnished in 2011 to pay a defaulted 
student loan. Applicant’s documentary evidence show he rehabilitated his student loan in 
October 2012, and as of May 2016 his loan was in good standing.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2004 through 2010. Applicant’s documentary evidence shows that the IRS 
prepared substitute tax returns for Applicant for tax years 2004 and 2005 in 2008, and 
that he established a payment agreement in 2012. (Tr. 55, 57, AE 4-6) He failed to submit 
documentary evidence to show he filed income tax returns for tax years 2006 through 
2010. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant owes the IRS $27,000 for delinquent taxes for tax 
years 2004 through 2010. Applicant’s documentary evidence shows he has been making 
payments since 2012 for taxes owed for tax years 2004 and 2005. (Tr. 55, 57) As of May 
2016, he owed $2,872 for tax year 2005. He failed to submit documentary evidence 
showing he does not owe additional taxes for tax years 2006 through 2010. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a delinquent credit card debt. Applicant submitted documentary 
evidence to show that he started making payments in October 2015, and he had made 
seven $60 payments as of his hearing date. 
 
Concerning the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.q, Applicant submitted 
documentary evidence to show that he either paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved the 
alleged debts starting in about February 2015.  
 
 Applicant claimed he failed to establish payment plans before his creditors sought 
garnishment of his wages and failed to timely file his income tax returns because he went 
through a difficult period in his life. He testified that dealing with his family members’ health 
crises, deaths, and his own cancer diagnosis overwhelmed him. He could not handle the 
pressure, broke down, and his finances got out of control. Applicant explained that in 
1998, his younger sister passed away from cancer; in 2009, his grandmother passed 
away; in early 2000, his mother was diagnosed with cancer (still alive as of the hearing 
date); his stepfather passed away in 2011; and he had a malignant tumor removed in 
2006. 
 
 Additionally, Applicant explained he was unemployed from about 2002 to 2004. 
Although he received unemployment benefits during some of his unemployment period, 
his income was not sufficient to cover his living expenses and outstanding debts. At his 
hearing, Applicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He admitted that 
 
4 
                                         
 
disregarding his financial obligations was a mistake and that he was wrong in doing so. 
Applicant is now motivated to resolve his financial situation because he is concerned that 
if he dies, he will leave his mother with all of his financial problems. (Tr. 58) 
 
 Applicant believes he has been making considerable improvements resolving his 
financial problems. His student loan is current, all the collection accounts were paid, and 
he has had a payment agreement with the IRS since 2012. He noted that he would need 
his clearance and current job to continue paying his debts. Applicant’s documentary 
evidence shows that since 2012 he has paid the IRS $21,313. He claimed he paid 
$33,162 on other accounts, and the grand total of payments total $54,475. He promised 
to resolve all of his delinquent debts, in particular those to the IRS as soon as possible. 
 
Policies 
 
Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted “only upon a finding 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The 
U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no one 
has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 
(1988). 
 
The AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person’s 
suitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition 
is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be 
measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified 
information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration 
of the whole person and the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). All available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered.  
 
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government 
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The 
applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  
 
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with 
the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling 
interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The “clearly 
consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt 
about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government. “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. 
at 531; AG ¶ 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met 
the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a clearance.

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of financial problems is documented in his credit reports, his 
SOR response, his testimony, and the record evidence. AG ¶ 19 provides three 
disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in 
this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting 
financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required.” The record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(g), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and  
                                            
2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
 
6 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some important 
positive financial information. Because of his 2002-2004 underemployment and 
unemployment he lacked sufficient income to make payments and keep some debts 
current. Additionally, because of his relatives’ medical problems and passing away, and 
his and his mother’s health problems, Applicant neglected his financial and legal 
responsibilities. He failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2010, 
and acquired a significant tax debt. 
 
Applicant acknowledged his delinquent debts, and since 2012, he has been 
making payments to creditors and the IRS. He also claimed he filed all of his delinquent 
income tax returns, and he intends to pay his tax debts. I have credited Applicant with 
mitigating all the accounts alleged in the SOR except for SOR ¶¶ 1.c (failure to timely file 
returns for tax years 2004-2010) and 1.d (being indebted to the IRS for an undisclosed 
amount). 
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The record 
established that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal tax returns for tax years 2004 
through 2010. I gave Applicant the opportunity to show he had filed the tax returns for tax 
years 2006 through 2010, and he failed to submit documentary evidence of the filings. He 
also did not explain whether he filed his state tax returns for any years when he had not 
                                            
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

filed his federal income tax returns. It not clear from the evidence how much Applicant 
owes the IRS and his state for unfiled and unpaid taxes. 
 
Applicant’s explanations and evidence fail to establish that he has a track record 
of financial responsibility. Moreover, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. 
Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following principal rationale for 
reversal: 
 
 
8 
                                         
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. AG 
¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, 
but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 53 years old. He has worked for federal contractors since 2001, and 
he has possessed a security clearance since 2002, when he worked as a security officer. 
He has been working as a supervisory security specialist for his current employer since 
2007. There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Several circumstances beyond his control may have adversely affected his 
finances, including his period of underemployment and unemployment, his health 
problems, and being overwhelmed by his family’s health problems and the deaths and 
illnesses of his relatives. He receives credit for his efforts to resolve his financial problems 
since 2012. He has resolved most of the SOR financial concerns.  
 
Notwithstanding, Applicant’s evidence is insufficient to establish his financial 
responsibility under the circumstances. He presented no documentary evidence to show 
that he has filed his federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2010. Even if his failure 
to timely file his returns was due to circumstances beyond his control, Applicant failed to 
provide any reasonable explanation for his failure to file the delinquent returns since 2012. 
He also failed to present documentary evidence to show he is not delinquent for taxes 
due for tax years 2006 through 2010. 
 
When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax 
returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete 
making payments.3 Applicant waited several years (until 2008) to file his 2004 and 2005 
                                            
3 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
 
9 
                                         
 
federal tax returns; he has not filed federal tax returns for tax years 2006 through 2010; 
and he may owe substantial state and federal tax debts for those years.    
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and  
  1.e - 1.q:       For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-
03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the 
federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government 
for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has 
a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).
