Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges, and the record establishes that 
Applicant used marijuana three or four times in October 2011 while holding a security 
clearance. He self-reported his marijuana use. He provided a signed statement of intent 
not to use illegal drugs with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. Drug 
involvement security concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 14, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SCA). (GE 1) On December 8, 2015, the Department of 
Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant 
pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access 
to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
 
2 
                                         
 
revoked. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H (drug 
involvement).  
  
On January 25, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
On August 8, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September 8, 2016, 
the case was assigned to me. On November 18, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for December 8, 
2016. (HE 1) His hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered 8 exhibits and Applicant offered 11 exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-25, 123-
124; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-K) I sustained Applicant’s 
objections to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interviews 
(PSI), GE 4 and GE 5, because they were not authenticated. (Tr. 23) I initially sustained 
Applicant’s objection to GE 7 and GE 8 because they were not provided through 
discovery; however, after cross-examination, I admitted GE 7 and GE 8 about whether 
Applicant disclosed his marijuana use to his security officer. (Tr. 16-19, 122-124) There 
were no other objections, and all other proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
(Tr. 12-13; GE 1, 2, 3, and 6; AE A-K) On December 8, 2016, I received a transcript of 
the hearing.   
  
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old lead engineer who has worked for a major defense 
contractor since October 2015. (Tr. 31, 38; GE 1) He provides leadership and advice to 
15 engineers. (Tr. 41-42) In 2007, he began working for a major defense contractor as an 
engineer. (Tr. 39) In high school, Applicant had a 4.1 grade point average (GPA), and he 
was captain of the cross-country team. (Tr. 34) In 2004, he received a bachelor’s degree 
in mechanical engineering, and he had a 3.2 GPA. (Tr. 35; AE F) In 2007, he received a 
master’s degree in aerospace engineering. (Tr. 35) In graduate school he had a 4.0 GPA. 
(Tr. 35-36; AE F) His resume details his education and professional experiences. (Tr. 43; 
AE F)   
 
Applicant is not married, and he has no children. (GE 1) He has never served in 
the U.S. Armed Forces. (GE 1) In March 2009, Applicant received a security clearance. 
(Tr. 40) He did not receive access to classified information until 2012 or 2013. (Tr. 41) 
There is no evidence of any security violations.    
 
Drug Involvement 
 
In October 2011, Applicant was on vacation several hundred miles from his 
residence; a friend passed a marijuana pipe to him; and he used marijuana once or twice 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
with a friend he knew since high school. (Tr. 44-45, 62, 65) He has not visited the high 
school friend since 2013. (Tr. 62-63) Applicant believed his friend has stopped using 
illegal drugs because of changes in his friend’s life. (Tr. 64) After Applicant returned to his 
residence, in October 2011, he was at a pool at his apartment complex, when a friend 
passed him a pipe containing marijuana, and he inhaled marijuana smoke once. (Tr. 45, 
65, 67)  
 
Applicant moved to a different state and changed his employment after he used 
marijuana. (Tr. 47) He has not seen the friend who provided the marijuana since moving 
to a different state. (Tr. 66) He admitted the marijuana use as described in the SOR (three 
or four marijuana uses in October 2011 while holding a security clearance). (Tr. 31, 44; 
SOR ¶ 1.a response) In 2012, he disclosed his marijuana use to his security manager; 
however, his security manager did not provide a statement attesting to Applicant’s 
disclosure of his marijuana use in 2012. (Tr. 32, 68-72, 75-78, 101-102)  
 
Applicant disclosed his marijuana use on his February 14, 2014 SCA. (Tr. 31; GE 
1) Other than his marijuana use in October 2011, he has never used illegal drugs. (Tr. 32, 
61) He has not been offered marijuana since 2011. (Tr. 81) He has never had a positive 
urinalysis for use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 50) He promised to not use illegal drugs, to comply 
with security rules, and to be trustworthy and responsible in his handling of classified 
information. (Tr. 32) He has abstained from marijuana use for 62 months. (Tr. 48) He 
does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 48, 57)  
 
Applicant told his closest confidants, including his girlfriend, father, and 
engineering mentors or colleagues, that he used marijuana. (Tr. 46-47, 52-56, 72-77; AE 
H-AE K) His father works for a state government. (Tr. 37) Appellant told his father that he 
used marijuana even though he knew his father would be disappointed in him. (Tr. 37) 
His father was pleased that Appellant told the government about his marijuana use 
because it showed his good character. (Tr. 37-38) 
 
Applicant had received training from his employer that marijuana use was 
prohibited. (Tr. 46, 59-60) He knew it was illegal to possess marijuana. (Tr. 46) He said 
he was sorry for his marijuana use; he acknowledged that he used poor judgment; and 
he admitted he was wrong. (Tr. 45-46, 56, 84)  
 
Applicant does not associate with illegal drug users or frequent locations where 
illegal drugs are used. (Tr. 47) He does not attend parties where marijuana is used. (Tr. 
80) If someone uses marijuana at a party, Applicant leaves the party. (Tr. 80) He did not 
receive drug rehabilitation counseling because he believed he could abstain from illegal 
drug use without it. (Tr. 50)  
 
In January 2016, Applicant provided a signed statement of intent not to use 
marijuana or any other illegal drug with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. (Tr. 48-51; AE G) See AG ¶ 26(b)(4), infra. On December 8, 2016, he reaffirmed 
his statement of intent. (Tr. 50)

Character Evidence 
 
Three of Applicant’s colleagues and friends provided character statements. (Tr. 
85-120; AE H-AE K) The general sense of the statements is that Applicant is enthusiastic, 
dedicated, reliable, diligent, professional, trustworthy, competent, and ethical. (Tr. 85-
120; AE E-AE H) Applicant’s employers gave him excellent performance evaluations. (Tr. 
40; AE C; AE E) He successfully completed his employer’s leadership program. (Tr. 40; 
AE D)  
   
Policies 
  
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. This 
decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about 
applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security 
clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
5 
                                         
 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Drug Involvement 
 
AG ¶ 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: 
 
[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person’s ability or 
willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
AG ¶ 25 describes three drug-involvement disqualifying conditions that could raise 
a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: “(a) any drug abuse;”2 
“(c) illegal drug possession;” and “(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security 
clearance.” AG ¶¶ 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply because Applicant used marijuana three 
or four times in October 2011 while holding a security clearance.3 Consideration of 
mitigating conditions is required.  
 
  
                                            
2AG ¶ 24(b) defines “drug abuse” as “the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner 
that deviates from approved medical direction.” 
 
3AG ¶ 24(a) defines “drugs” as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: 
 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, 
stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.  
 
Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. § 
812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I(c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, 
545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). 
 
6 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
  AG ¶ 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating conditions:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  
 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance 
for any violation; 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without 
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical 
professional. 
AG ¶ 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. 
There are no “bright line” rules for determining when such conduct is “recent.” The 
determination must be based “on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within 
the parameters set by the directive.” ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2004). See ISCR Case No. 14-05095 at 3 n. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016) (affirming lack of 
bright-line test for recency of illegal drug use) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-01847 at 3 (App. 
 
7 
                                         
 
Bd. Apr. 9, 2015)). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 
(App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant’s last use of marijuana occurring 
approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent; however, the marijuana use 
in that case was not while holding a security clearance. If the evidence shows “a 
significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,” then an 
administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates “changed 
circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.”4 
Applicant used marijuana about three or four times in October 2011. His most 
recent marijuana use was 62 months before his hearing. He recognizes the adverse 
impact on his life of drug abuse. These actions create some certitude that he will continue 
to abstain from drug use. AG ¶ 26(a) applies to his marijuana-related offenses.5    
 
Applicant has completed a sustained period of abstinence, and he provided “a 
signed statement of intent [not to use illegal drugs] with automatic revocation of clearance 
for any violation.” He does not associate with drug users, and he does not go to or stay 
in environments where drugs were or are used. AG ¶ 26(b) applies. AG ¶¶ 26(c) and 
26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse drugs after being issued a 
prescription that is lawful under federal law. He did not provide proof of satisfactory 
                                            
4 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the 
absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge 
excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, 
and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board 
stated:  
 
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage of 
three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the 
administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, 
the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that 
mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR Case 
No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a rational 
basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol 
rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency 
analysis of an administrative judge stating: 
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of 
improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security 
clearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year 
from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal 
purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
 
5In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an 
unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use 
was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. See also ISCR 
Case No. 15-03403 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2016) (affirming denial of security clearance for applicant who 
used marijuana while holding a security clearance 37 months before administrative judge’s decision); ISCR 
Case No. 14-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015) (affirming denial of security clearance and addressing 
the security significance of illegal drug use after having completed a security clearance application).  
 
8 
                                         
 
completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare 
requirements, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.    
 
In sum, the only evidence of Applicant’s marijuana use is his self-report during the 
security clearance process. He provided a signed statement of intent not to use illegal 
drugs with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. He credibly described his 
marijuana use, and he sincerely expressed remorse for his marijuana use, and he 
promised not to use marijuana in the future. He has abstained from marijuana use for 62 
months, demonstrating a sufficient track record of no drug abuse to mitigate drug 
involvement security concerns. Even if security concerns were not mitigated under AG ¶ 
26, they would be mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline H, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old lead engineer who has worked for a major defense 
contractor since October 2015. He provides leadership and advice to 15 engineers. In 
2007, he began working as an engineer for a major defense contractor. In 2004, he 
received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and he had a 3.2 GPA. In 2007, 
he received a master’s degree in aerospace engineering. In graduate school he had a 4.0 
GPA. His resume details his education and professional experiences. In March 2009, 
Applicant received a security clearance. There is no evidence of any security violations.    
 
Three of Applicant’s colleagues and friends described Applicant as enthusiastic, 
dedicated, reliable, diligent, professional, trustworthy, competent, and ethical. His 
employers gave him excellent performance evaluations, and he successfully completed 
his employer’s leadership program.   
 
 
9 
                                         
 
In October 2011, Applicant used marijuana three or four times while holding a 
security clearance. He self-reported his marijuana use to security in 2012, and on his 
February 14, 2014 SCA. There is no evidence that he lied about his marijuana use or that 
the Government suspected him of using marijuana before he made these disclosures. He 
provided a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. He ended his marijuana use in October 2011, and his marijuana use is not 
recent. He disclosed his marijuana use to family and friends. He expressed remorse about 
his marijuana use. He sincerely and credibly assures he will not use marijuana in the 
future.  
  
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Drug 
involvement security concerns are mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with national security to reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
