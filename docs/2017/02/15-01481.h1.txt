METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 26 September 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision without2
hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case
closed 1 March 2016, when Department Counsel stated no objection to Applicant’s
Response to the FORM (Response). DOHA assigned the case to me 19 October 2016.
Record documents highlight the difficulty of following education loans through their various successors-in-3
interest. According to Applicant’s February 2014 credit report (Item 5), this account first appears as an
education loan by Bank of America in August 2007 as reported to Equifax, one of the three main credit
bureaus. The account was identified by a specific 10-digit account number, 57*******1, indicating the first
disbursement of an education loan. The original high credit was $10,337. As of November 2010, the loan had
been assigned to the Government because it was 120-days past due. The same information was reported to
Experian, the second of the three main credit bureaus, by ACS, an education loan servicing agent. The same
credit report reflects that the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) opened an account with an identical
account number in January 2008, as reported to Equifax. This account was in collection as of September
2010. However, the high credit reported was $8,544. The same credit report lists what appears to be the same
account under FEDLOAN, based on the same $8,544 high credit, but with an entirely different 10-digit account
number, 78********FD00001. This account was reported to Equifax as 120-days past due as of January 2014.
Finally, in February 2014, ECMC, a collection agent for delinquent education loans reported a collection
account to TransUnion—the third of the credit bureaus—on behalf of Bank of America, which was $10,477
past due on a balance of $13,529. However, this account has a third distinct 10-digit account number,
66*******). This is the debt alleged at SOR 1.f. Applicant’s January 2015 credit report (by Equifax) shows a
collection account by ECMC, 66XXXX, being $5,707 past due on a high-credit of $10,477. This is the debt
alleged in SOR 1.a. In addition, a July 2014 garnishment notification from Applicant’s company (Item 7)
showing a garnishment order from ECMC, beginning in May 2014, for $501.13 bi-weekly, on an account with
a nine-digit account number, 57*******. This could be the Bank of America education loan, morphing through
ACS, USDOE, and FEDLOAN, before coming to rest at ECMC, but only if the missing 10  digit is 1. If theth
missing digit is 2 or 3, then the garnishment order is for one of the accounts at SOR 1.d or 1.e. The
garnishment order does not state the total amount to be garnished, which would provide a clue to which
account it was. In any event, Applicant’s Response indicates that he made bi-weekly garnishment payments
totaling $14,478 between May 2014 and August 2015 to satisfy the garnishment order in Item  7. Applicant
claimed that in February 2016 (Response) he obtained a copy of a credit report and this debt was not listed.
However, he did not provide a copy of that credit report.
Applicant’s Answer claimed that the payment was made in May 2014.4

Findings of Fact
Applicant denied the SOR financial allegations. He is a 58-year-old facility
manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor since October 2004. He was employed
in a similar position from October 2001 to September 2004. Applicant served on active
duty in the U.S. military from October 1975 to May 1996, received an honorable
discharge, and retired on disability pay. He held a clearance while in the military, and
seeks to retain the industrial clearance he received most recently in February 2009
(Item 3). He has been married since January 1977.
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 3-7) substantiate, six
delinquent debts totaling over $46,000. The bulk of the debt is for delinquent education
loans. Available evidence suggests, but does not confirm, that SOR debt 1.a is the
same as SOR debt 1.f.3
Regarding SOR debt 1.b, Applicant’s Response provided a 24 February 2016
letter from a collection agent for a current account owner with an account number
33***********, that shows an account paid in full on 21 February 2014.  The original4
owner is the same as the creditor in SOR 1.b, but the account number for the original
The letter, for account number 10********, reflects a $37,784.90 principal balance, with interest, fees and costs5
bringing the total balance to $60,392.19. SOR allegations 1.d and 1.e are based on credit entries made to
Experian for accounts number 78**********FD00002 and 78**********FD00003, respectively (Item 5). The
entries reflect that the accounts were over 120-days past due in the amounts of $3,448 and $3,859, on high
credits of $14,240 and $15,614, and balances of $14,237 and $15,614, respectively. The combined balances
total $29,851. The accounts correspond to collection accounts reported by USDOE to Equifax, with account
numbers 57*******2 and 57*******3, respectively, but with high credits of $14,812 and $15,384, respectively,
or $30,196 total. The same two accounts appear in Item 6, with partial account numbers, and the same high
credit amounts, but did not report any balances due or past-due amounts, as the accounts had been assigned
to the Government.
Applicant stated that he brought his mortgage account current by taking a hardship withdrawal from his6
retirement account (Item 4).
This account, with the identical first-ten digits, also appears in Applicant’s January 2015 credit report (item7
6) with the same information reported by NELNET, another servicer of delinquent education loans.

owner is 60************** (Item 5). The same account also appears in Item 6, with the
identical first-eight digits of the account number. 
Regarding SOR debt 1.c, Applicant’s Response also contained a 25 February
2016 letter from another collection agent that an account with file number 09-XXXX had
been satisfied. The letter did not state when the account had been satisfied, or in what
amount. One of the listed creditors is the same judgment creditor alleged in SOR 1.c,
whom Applicant claimed was paid in January 2013 (Answer). However, the judgment
was filed in April 2010, with case number 10****** (Item 5).
Finally, Applicant claimed that the education loans at SOR 1.d and 1.e had been
combined into a separate account and he was making $350 monthly payments. In his
Response, Applicant provided a 24 February 2016 letter from the National Payment
Center for the USDOE stating that Applicant had been making monthly payments of at
least $350 since 21 April 2014.5
Applicant reported three delinquent accounts on his January 2014 clearance
application (Item 3), but only SOR debt 1.c was included. He discussed all the
unfavorable accounts on his February 2014 credit report with a Government investigator
during his April 2014 subject interview (Item 4). He claimed to have paid all his
education loans in full, except for SOR 1.g, which he stated he would investigate.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his paying legal expenses related to
his adult son’s divorce and paying college expenses for his daughter (Item 3, 4). He fell
behind on his accounts, including his first mortgage, which is now current, but upon
which foreclosure proceedings had been initiated.  In addition to the SOR debts,6
Applicant’s February 2014 credit report (Item 5) contains an education loan reported to
Experian by American Education Services (AES) on behalf of Suntrust Bank and
assigned to the Government. Account number 17******PA00001 was over 120-days
past due with an high credit of $10,000.7

evidence of community involvement.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of
financial difficulties, which are ongoing.  Applicant’s accounts became delinquent when9
he chose to bear the legal expenses of his adult son and the college expenses of his
daughter. He did not provide information about the onset of these financial problems, or
when they abated.
Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.
His financial difficulties are both recent and multiple; and Applicant provided no
¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that10
it is  unlikely to recur . . . 
Assuming that the collection agent’s 25 February 2016 letter (Response) constitutes adequate circumstantial11
proof that the account referred to is the same as SOR debt 1.c.
¶20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and12
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
Again, assuming that the garnishment order (Item 7) refers to SOR debt 1.f, despite the fact that the account13
number alleged in SOR 1.f does not correspond to the account number in Item 7.
¶20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that14
the problem is being resolved or is under control;
¶20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.15

evidence to show that the immediate causes of his problems have been resolved.  The10
financial problems were not due to circumstances beyond his control because he made
a conscious decision to bear some of his adult son’s legal expenses and his daughter’s
college expenses. Moreover, he cannot be said to have been fully responsible in
addressing his debts because he satisfied SOR debt 1.c  only after the creditor11
obtained a judgment against him.  And SOR debt 1.f was only paid when the creditor12
garnished his wages.  The Government is not the collection agent of last resort.13
Applicants are expected to pay their debts because of their legal and moral obligation to
do so, not because their clearances may be at risk. Further, debts that are taken to
judgment or enforced through garnishment do not demonstrate responsible action by
the Applicant.
 
Applicant submitted no evidence to show that he received credit or financial
counseling, and the evidence he submitted does not fully show that the debts are being
resolved.  It may be that some debts are resolved and some debts are being resolved14
in what may fairly be described as a good-faith effort to address his debts.  But without15
a more precise paper trail demonstrating that the education account described in the 24
February 2016 USDOE letter encompasses the loans alleged in SOR debts 1.d and 1.e,
I am unable to find that Applicant has adequately addressed the security concerns
raised by his financial problem. In addition, he did not provide a copy of his most recent
credit report, a document that may have corroborated some of his claims. Accordingly, I
conclude Guideline F against Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
