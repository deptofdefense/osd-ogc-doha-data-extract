HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges eight delinquent debts totaling 
$19,479. In 2011, she paid the student loan debt for $17,875, and one SOR debt is a 
duplication of another SOR debt. She has six SOR debts totaling $1,463 to resolve. 
Despite her limited means, she has made sufficient progress resolving her delinquent 
SOR debts. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are mitigated, and 
eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 23, 2015, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for National 
Security Position (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 25, 2016, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and 
modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, 
as amended (Regulation); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF 
was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails 
access to sensitive information. (HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such access to sensitive information should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On August 9, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) On 
October 5, 2016, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On 
November 1, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On November 18, 2016, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for 
December 7, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant waived her 
right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of her hearing. (Tr. 15-16) At the 
hearing, the Government provided 4 exhibits; Applicant offered 11 exhibits; and all 
exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1-4; Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A-K) On December 15, 2016, I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.). I 
held the record open until February 8, 2017; however, no post-hearing evidence was 
received. (Tr. 39)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and she said she needed 
to validate the other SOR debts. (HE 2) Her admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make 
the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a DOD contractor, who works in inventory 
management. (Tr. 10) She has been employed in inventory management by her current 
employer from 2010 to 2012 and since May 2015. (Tr. 10, 26) In 1983, Applicant 
graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) Applicant attended college from 1983 to 1989, and 
she majored in communications with a multitude of sub-majors.  (Tr. 7) She did not 
receive a degree. (Tr. 7) She has never served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 1986, Applicant 
married, and in 1993, she divorced. (Tr. 7) In 2002, she married, and in 2006, she 
divorced. (Tr. 7-8) Her children are ages 25, 28, and 30. (Tr. 8) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In the last ten years, Applicant has had several periods of unemployment ranging 
from two to eight months. (Tr. 26) Her finances were harmed by her surgery in 2005 and 
her divorce in 2006. (Tr. 27) In 2008 or 2009, she received a $400,000 settlement from 
her husband to resolve her divorce. (Tr. 28) She used the divorce settlement to pay her 
debts, to pay some of her children’s debts, to help her autistic child, to help a friend who 
had a traumatic brain injury, and to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 28, 37-38)  
 
Applicant’s current annual salary is $39,000. (Tr. 23) She uses a budget, and she 
has received some financial counseling or advice. (Tr. 24) At the end of the month, after 
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names 
of other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and her family’s privacy. The cited sources 
contain more specific information.

she pays her debts, she has a remainder of about $200. (Tr. 24) She has savings of 
about $30,000 received from her divorce settlement. (Tr. 25)  
 
Applicant disclosed that an April 24, 2015 notice that her pay was being 
garnished to pay a $10,000 debt owed to a non-SOR creditor;2 however, after she 
changed employment, the notice was not sent to her new employer. (Tr. 20; AE A) She 
did not pay the debt. (Tr. 20) She said she intended to contact the creditor to “see what 
we can work out.” (Tr. 20) She did not know why she owed $10,000, and she observed 
that she needed to “focus on” this debt. (Tr. 33) This debt does not appear on her credit 
reports.  
 
On February 17, 2016, Applicant received notice of an offset of her pay for $788 
to collect a state tax debt for 2014. (AE J) She has not paid her 2014 state tax debt. (Tr. 
32) She has filed her state and federal tax returns for the last five years, and the only 
year she owes taxes is $788 for tax year 2014 to her state of residence. (Tr. 32-33) She 
intends to pay her $788 state tax debt. (Tr. 32-33) She said she would provide proof of 
payment after her hearing. (Tr. 38) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a student loan debt for $17,875 and the high credit on account 
was $15,746. (GE 4 at 4) Applicant made $185 monthly payments for several months; 
she became unemployed; and she stopped making payments. (Tr. 28) On March 2, 
2011, Applicant settled the debt with a payment of $19,900. (Tr. 29; AE H; AE I) She 
provided a copy of the cashier’s check used to pay this debt. (AE H) She used money 
from her divorce settlement to pay this debt. (Tr. 29)  
 
Applicant’s August 1, 2015 TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax combined credit 
report indicates Applicant had a student loan with a high credit of $15,745, and the 
status is “settlement accepted on this account.” The balance owed is listed as zero. (GE 
4 at 4) Applicant’s April 6, 2016 Equifax credit report does not include any delinquent 
student loans. (GE 3) Applicant June 13, 2016 TransUnion credit report includes a 
delinquent student loan debt for debt for $17,875 and the high credit on account was 
$15,746. (AE K) I conclude the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b was paid and resolved on March 2, 
2011, and the negative financial entry in her June 13, 2016 credit report is an erroneous 
entry. 
                                            
2Applicant’s SOR does not allege: (1) she received notice of a possible $10,000 garnishment in 
2015 and (2) she has a state tax debt for $788 for tax year 2014. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR 
may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

These two debts will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a judgment for $418. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e allege two collection 
debts for $443 and $158 being collected by the same company. SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.h 
allege two medical-collection debts for $205 and $97 that are being collected by the 
same company. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g allege two telecommunications-collection debts for $142 and 
$141 originating from the same telecommunications company. I agree with Applicant 
that these two debts are duplications of each other.  
 
In November 2016, Applicant wrote the creditors and disputed her responsibility 
for the debts. (Tr. 29-30, 38; AE C-AE G) Applicant has no recollection of owing the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c through 1.g. (Tr. 30) She intends to continue to dispute the 
SOR debts, and in the event that she receives debt validation, she will pay the debts. 
(Tr. 33-34)     
 
Applicant gave three reasons to explain why she had not been more proactive in 
investigating and resolving her delinquent accounts as follows: (1) she was not sure 
whether she would have employment after January 2017 because her employer was 
competing for a government contract; (2) her employer’s facility security clearance is in 
jeopardy; and (3) she was overwhelmed by her financial issues. (Tr. 31-32) Her promise 
to continue to diligently investigate her debts and resolve the debts that are validated is 
accepted as credible.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7, C3.1.2.2, and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of national security and sensitive records is paramount. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations trustworthiness concern as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets 
as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s [eligibility for a public trust position].  
 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted). AG ¶ 19 
provides two disqualifying conditions that raise a trustworthiness concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained the evidentiary weight to be given to credit 
reports: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports. Her credit reports document eight delinquent SOR debts totaling $19,479. 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
  AG ¶¶ 20(a) to 20(d) are applicable. Seven circumstances caused damage to 
Applicant’s finances: (1) her surgery in 2005; (2) her divorce in 2006; (3) her children’s 
debts; (4) her child’s autism; (5) her friend’s traumatic brain injury; (6) 
underemployment; and (7) multiple periods of unemployment over the last eight years. 
All of these are circumstances beyond her control except for her decisions to assist 
others with their financial problems. It is also noted that in 2008 or 2009, she received a 
$400,000 settlement from her divorce, which allowed her to pay most of her debts.    
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

  Applicant paid over 90 percent of her SOR debt in 2011 when she paid her 
student loan. About $1,500 in SOR debt is in the process of being verified. Once the 
debts are verified, Applicant promised to pay them. In addition to the SOR debts, 
Applicant has a delinquent $788 state tax debt. and she may have a $10,000 debt that 
led to an attempted garnishment in 2015.  
 
   In ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009), the Appeal Board 
addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically unemployed and 
lacked the ability to pay his creditors, noting that “it will be a long time at best before he 
has paid” all of his creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment compensation 
at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a circumstance was 
not necessarily a bar to having access to classified or sensitive information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
  Applicant made significant progress on her SOR debts when she paid her 
student loan debt. She understands what she must do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility.4 She is investigating and verifying her responsibility for the SOR 
debts. She volunteered that she had two additional debts not listed on the SOR or in her 
credit reports: a $788 state tax debt; and a possible $10,000 debt that resulted in a 
garnishment notice in 2015. She took reasonable actions to resolve as much of her 
debts as was possible based on her limited income. She acknowledged that she needs 
to continue to persevere in her debt resolution. There are clear indications her financial 
problem is being resolved and is under control. Her efforts are sufficient to mitigate 
financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.   
 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a contractor, who works in inventory 
management. She has been employed in inventory management by her current 
employer from 2010 to 2012 and since May 2015. Applicant attended college from 1983 
to 1989, and she majored in communications with a multitude of sub-majors. She did 
not receive a degree. In 1986, Applicant married, and in 1993, she divorced. In 2002, 
she married, and in 2006, she divorced. Her children are ages 25, 28, and 30. In 2008 
or 2009, she received a $400,000 settlement from her divorce. 
 
 Applicant’s SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $19,479. In 2011, she 
paid her student loan debt for $17,875, and one SOR debt is a duplication of another 
SOR debt. She has six SOR debts totaling $1,463 to resolve. She is seeking verification 
of the validity of six SOR debts, and she promised to pay them if they are validated. 
Seven circumstances partially or fully beyond her control adversely affected her 
finances. Particularly important were her unemployment, underemployment, and family 
illnesses. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis 
in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She took reasonable actions under her particular financial 
circumstances to address her delinquent debts. Her overall history shows a “meaningful 
track record” of debt repayment. I am confident she will continue her establishment and 
maintenance of her financial responsibility.5  
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, the Directive, the 
Regulation, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are mitigated, and her 
eligibility for a public trust position is granted. 
      
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  For Applicant 
 
                                            
5Of course, the Government may re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of access to sensitive information now does not bar 
the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider 
[trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having 
negative [trustworthiness] significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). An 
administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board 
has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary [public trust position] to allow her the 
opportunity to have a [public trust position] while she works on her financial problems.”). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s public trust position is conditional.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
