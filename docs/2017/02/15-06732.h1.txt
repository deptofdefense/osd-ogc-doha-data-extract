Decision

DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems, dating back to before 2008, and 
including years of unpaid federal income taxes. Financial security concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On December 5, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 5, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

 On April 26, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a 
hearing. On August 29, 2016, the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me. On October 19, 2016, DOHA issued 
a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for November 15, 2016. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence.  
Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. All exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objections. The record closed at the end of the hearing. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 23, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, except the allegations in ¶¶ 1.d and 
1.h, which she denied with explanations. Her admissions are accepted as factual 
findings. 
 
 Applicant is 53 years old and married to her husband for 30 years. They have 
two adult children, ages 28 and 30. Both children are military veterans. Her husband 
became disabled in 2008 and has not been employed since then. He started receiving 
monthly disability payments of $1,300 in 2010. (Tr. 42-43.) 
 
 Applicant attributed the alleged financial problems to both her and her husband’s 
medical problems that resulted in unpaid bills because they did not have insurance. She 
stated that her husband’s disability, and numerous periods of unemployment or 
underemployment contributed to her financial issues. Over the past 12 years, she was 
unemployed during the following times: 6/2004 to 4/2005; 11/2005 to 1/2006; 4/2006 to 
8/2006; 9/2006 to 3/2007; 9/2009 to 8/2011; 11/2011 to 11/2012; 11/2013 to 12/2013; 
and 3/2014 to 8/2014. (GE 1.) She thinks the last time she had full-time employment 
was in 2014 for three months. She collected unemployment in 2015, but has not 
collected it in 2016. (Tr. 35.) Her most recent employment position was a part-time job 
from September through November 2016. She is currently unemployed. (Tr. 41.) 
 
 When Applicant completed a November 2014 e-QIP, she disclosed that she and 
her husband owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about $6,000.00 for unpaid 
income taxes for years: 2006, 2007, 2012, and 2013. She told the investigator that she 
made an arrangement with the IRS to start a repayment plan in November 2014 to 
resolve the outstanding taxes. (GE 1.) There is no evidence of the payment plan or 
payments made to the IRS. 
 
 On April 5, 2016, DOHA issued a SOR to Applicant. On April 21, 2016, she 
contacted a debt consolidation company for assistance in managing debts. According to 
the budget she prepared with the company’s assistance, her net monthly income at that 
time was $1,726, and expenses were $1,662. The company proposed resolving 16 
delinquent debts totaling $13,861 through monthly payments of $510, beginning in June 
2016. Applicant did not make any payments into the repayment plan because her job 
terminated before June 2016. (Tr. 34.)  
 
 
3 
 
 
  On April 25, 2016, Applicant contacted the IRS to inquire about her tax liability 
for tax years 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2014. The IRS responded and told her 
she owed $9,018 for those years. (Answer; AE A.)  
 
 In October 2016, the IRS notified Applicant that she owed taxes for the following 
years: 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2014.1 The IRS proposed a monthly payment 
of $5, beginning on November 28, 2016, and increasing to $200 on November 28, 2017. 
Applicant testified that she intended to make the first $5 payment at the end of the 
month. (Tr. 33; AE E.) Applicant said that she filed her federal and state tax returns for 
2015, and owed the IRS $970.00 and the state $90.00.2 (Tr. 26-28; AE D.) The unpaid 
2015 federal taxes are not included in the proposed monthly installment agreement. 
She thinks she owes the IRS about $10,000 for all seven-tax years. (Tr. 32-33.)  
 
 Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from July 2016, February 2016, July 2015, 
and December 2014, the SOR alleged 22 delinquent debts totaling about $23,000. The 
SOR also alleged two bankruptcies and delinquent federal income taxes for two years. 
The status of each allegation is as follows.  
 
 (¶ 1.a) In October 2008, Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. 
In March 2009, the court discharged about $13,300 in delinquent debts, which were 
incurred between 2004 and 2008. They included medical, dental, utility, and credit card 
bills. The bankruptcy disclosed that Applicant and her husband owed the IRS $3,500 in 
unpaid taxes for 2006 and $300 in unpaid state taxes for 2006. Applicant said the 
medical bills related to her husband’s disability. Applicant and her husband reported an 
average monthly income of $2,426 and expenses of $2,380 at that time. (Tr. 16; GE 8.)  
 
 (¶ 1.b) In September 2013, Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter 13 
Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy listed delinquent debts that totaled $52,160. They included 
$27,500 in defaulted student loans, $10,000 in medical bills, and $14,500 in 
miscellaneous debts, such as utility bills, phone bills, credit card bills, insurance bills, 
cash advances, repair bills, and unpaid non-sufficient funds (NSF) checks. At the time 
they filed this bankruptcy, they reported a monthly income of $4,021. The bankruptcy 
was dismissed in April 2014, after Applicant lost her job and was unable to make 
automatic payments through her salary. She held a security clearance for that position. 
(Tr. 17-18; GE 7.)  
 
(¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) Applicant owes the IRS for delinquent taxes for tax years 2006 
and 2013. (Answer; AE. A.) 
                                                 
1 The SOR alleged unpaid taxes for 2006 and 2013. Hence, the unpaid taxes for years 2005, 2008, 2009 
and 2014, will not be considered in the analysis of disqualifying conditions. They may be considered in 
the analysis of mitigating conditions, the whole person concept, and Applicant’s credibility. 
 
2 The SOR did not allege unpaid taxes for 2015. Hence, those unpaid taxes will not be considered in the 
analysis of disqualifying conditions. They may be considered in the analysis of mitigating conditions, the 
whole person concept, and Applicant’s credibility. 
 
 
 
4 
 
 
 
(¶¶ 1.e through 1.z) These debts are unresolved. Applicant said they were 
previously included in the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy she filed in 2013, but was unable to 
complete. 
 
 Applicant is not working. She and her husband use his monthly disability 
payment of $1,400 to pay their expenses that total $1,300. (Tr. 27.) They intend to file a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy to discharge the debts previously included in the dismissed 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, they have been unable to file the bankruptcy because 
they do not have enough money for the filing costs. Applicant’s student loans, totaling 
$28,852, were deferred in August 2016 and will remain in that status until April 2017. If 
she is unable to begin payments then, she will apply for another period of deferment. 
(Tr. 26-28, 30-31, 38; AE C.) 
 
 Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a former employer. He said 
she is a trustworthy person. A long-time friend stated that Applicant is a reliable and 
hardworking individual. (Answer.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶¶ 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable 
guidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. 
The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the 
Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant 
 
 
5 
 
 
or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to 
obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides: “[a]ny determination under this 
order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest 
and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” 
 
A person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information.3 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
                                                 
3 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App.Bd. May 1, 2012).

(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Beginning prior to October 2008 when she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and 
subsequent to the filing, Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that she has been 
unable or unwilling to resolve. That debt includes unpaid federal taxes. The evidence 
raises the above two security concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to 
rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  
 
 The guideline includes four conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from Applicant’s delinquent debts: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems began before 2008 when she filed a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and subsequently discharged about $13,000 in delinquent debt. After that, 
she accumulated over $52,000 of delinquent debts, as documented in her 2013 Chapter 
13 bankruptcy. Those debts remain unresolved. Her reliability in managing income tax 
obligations for at least seven years remains a concern. AG ¶ 20(a) does not provide 
mitigation.  
 
 Applicant has been unemployed for numerous periods and currently is 
unemployed. She and her husband have had medical problems that resulted in unpaid 
bills for which they did not have insurance. Her husband has been on disability since 
2010. Those circumstances were beyond her control. She provided some evidence that 
she attempted to responsibly manage the delinquent debts when she filed a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy in 2013. However, after it was dismissed in early 2014, there is little 
evidence that she took any additional steps to address the debts or taxes until April 
2016 when she contacted the IRS and a debt consolidation company. AG ¶ 20(b) 
provides partial mitigation.  
 
 
7 
 
 
   Applicant received credit or budgetary counseling from a debt consolidation 
company in April 2016, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that her finances 
are under control or coming under control. Mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c) was not 
established. She provided evidence that at the end of November 2016, she intended to 
start a payment plan for unpaid federal taxes for years 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, 
and 2014, but not 2015. She has not paid or addressed any of the 22 SOR-listed 
delinquent debts, including three small medical debts for $35, $43, or $51. Hence, there 
is minimal evidence demonstrating a good-faith effort to resolve debts and legal 
obligations. AG ¶ 20(d) provides limited mitigation.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment, based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, honest, 
and intelligent 52-year-old woman, who experienced financial problems prior to October 
2008 when she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She subsequently discharged about 
$13,000 of delinquent debts. Her financial problems continued after that discharge, and 
led to Applicant’s filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2013. She was unable to 
maintain payments into the bankruptcy plan because she lost her job in April 2014. In 
addition to accumulating delinquent debts over the years, she and her husband owe the 
IRS about $10,000 for unpaid income taxes for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 
2014, and 2015. In 2014, she told an investigator that she was starting a payment plan 
to resolve six of those years. That did not occur. In November 2016, she agreed to 
begin payments on a plan she negotiated with the IRS in April 2016, seemingly after 
receiving the SOR. While many of her financial difficulties are undoubtedly related to a 
lack of steady employment and her husband’s disability, she did not demonstrate that 
she made consistent efforts over the years to responsibly manage financial obligations, 
 
 
8 
 
 
including income taxes. Seven years of unpaid and unaddressed taxes is a serious 
security concern.  
 
 In ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009,) the Appeal Board 
addressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the 
ability to pay her creditors. The Appeal Board noted, “It will be a long time at best before 
she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment 
compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a 
circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information 
stating:  
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct,” that is actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) 
 
 In this case, Applicant recently negotiated a payment plan with the IRS based on 
her limited income, but had not yet started the payments at the time of the hearing. 
Applicant was unable to maintain payments into the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan she 
established. However, she took no further steps, including making nominal payments on 
delinquent debts or taxes, since April 2014. To date, she has not established a 
consistent track record of responsibly handling financial obligations to outweigh years of 
financial problems and unpaid taxes. Applicant did not meet her burden to mitigate the 
security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:       AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.z:       Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
