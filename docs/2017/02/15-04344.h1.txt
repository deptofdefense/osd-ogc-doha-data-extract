HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges three federal tax liens totaling 
$133,111 and three non-tax debts totaling about $15,500. After filing his tax returns, he 
owed additional taxes for tax years 2005 through 2008. He currently owes the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) $125,000 for federal income taxes. Financial considerations 
security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 26, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On February 26, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On April 27, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
July 20, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On August 30, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On October 3, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October 27, 2016. 
(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; and 
all proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 14-22; GE 1-9) Applicant 
provided corrections to GE 4, an August 27, 2008 Office of Personnel Management 
personal subject interview (OPM PSI), and his corrections were accepted as changes to 
GE 4. (Tr. 14-22) On November 3, 2016, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. 
Post-hearing delays were granted until December 12, 2016, and then until February 3, 
2017, to permit Applicant to provide additional information about his finances. (HE 4) 
Applicant did not provide any post-hearing documents.    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he partially admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. He also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.  
 
Applicant is 59 years old, and he has worked as a tool engineer for 24 years. (Tr. 
5, 33-34) In 1975, he graduated from high school, and in 1982, he received a bachelor of 
science degree. (Tr. 6) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 6) In 1982, he married, and 
his children are ages 25 and 29. (Tr. 7) He worked for one major defense contractor for 
26 years and for another contractor for 2 years. (Tr. 46) He has not been unemployed for 
the previous 14 years. (Tr. 24) He described himself as dedicated to his family and a 
diligent employee who makes important contributions to his company. (Tr. 48-49) He has 
held a security clearance for 23 years, and there is no evidence of security violations. (Tr. 
8)   
  
Financial Considerations 
 
 In 2002, Applicant failed to withhold enough from his salary for his income taxes, 
and when he filed his tax returns he learned he owed about $8,000 to the IRS and $1,500 
to the state for income taxes. (Tr. 26) He believed his tax refunds in 2003 and 2004 were 
sufficient to pay his tax debt for tax year 2002. (Tr. 36) For tax year 2005, Applicant owed 
about $5,000 in additional federal income taxes. (Tr. 27) Applicant owed taxes for 2002, 
2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. (Tr. 29, 32) He believed the 2002 taxes were resolved in his 
2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. (Tr. 38) 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3 
                                         
 
Applicant said he had an installment plan with the state one year ago to address a 
$780 state tax debt for tax year 2015. (Tr. 29-30, 32, 38) He said he paid off his other 
state tax debts. (Tr. 30)  
 
The IRS garnished Applicant’s wages, and Applicant hired a law firm to negotiate 
resolution of his tax debt. (Tr. 31) The IRS ended the garnishment. (Tr. 31) Applicant said 
he took out a mortgage to pay his IRS debt. (Tr. 31) Initially Applicant made $500 monthly 
payments to the IRS. (Tr. 31, 45) In 2015, he made some $2,500 monthly payments to 
the IRS. (Tr. 31, 45) He was unable to continue making the $2,500 payments. (Tr. 31) 
Applicant said two months before his hearing the IRS said the total owed to the federal 
government was $125,000. (Tr. 32-33)  
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $147,000, and his spouse’s annual salary is $40,000. 
(Tr. 33) His salary has been gradually increasing about one to two percent annually for 
the previous five years. (Tr. 33, 47) His spouse was unemployed for two or three years 
about 10 years ago. (Tr. 46) His mortgage is current, and he does not have any credit 
cards or car payments. (Tr. 41) He has $209,000 in his 401(k) account. (Tr. 42)  
 
 The SOR alleges the following federal tax liens: ¶ 1.a for $24,781 entered in August 
2015; ¶ 1.b for $39,107 entered in November 2014; and ¶ 1.c for $69,223 entered in 
November 2014. The three tax liens are documented in his February 3, 2016 credit report. 
(GE 9)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege two medical collection debts for $85 and $41. Applicant 
said his spouse’s pay was garnished to pay these two debts, and she told Applicant the 
two medical debts are paid. (Tr. 39) Applicant is credited with mitigating these two debts. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a debt relating to a repossessed vehicle for $15,483. Applicant 
cosigned for a vehicle that his daughter received. (Tr. 40) In 2013, the vehicle was totaled 
in an accident. (Tr. 40) He believed the debt was actually about $7,000. (Tr. 41) Applicant 
did not make any payments to address this debt. (Tr. 41)  
 
In sum, Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence showing the amount 
of his IRS debt, the years he underpaid his taxes, and the payments made under his 
payment plans.   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
 
4 
                                         
 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, OPM PSI, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions 
that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” The 
record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and  
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
6 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating 
conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some important 
positive financial information. Applicant has worked for defense contractors for almost 30 
years. His spouse was unemployed for a time, decreasing family income. He 
acknowledged his delinquent debts, and he said he intends to pay his debts. Aside from 
his federal tax debt, he only has one additional delinquent debt.   
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. Applicant 
said two months before his hearing the IRS said the total he owed to the federal 
government was $125,000. He has owed federal income taxes for ten years with his 
delinquent taxes accruing from tax years 2005 to 2008. Applicant has described some 
steps to pay his taxes; however, he did not provide documents proving his past payments 
or compliance with payment plans.  
 
Even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] 
federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such 
problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security 
worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” 
See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing 
“no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s 
well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
                                            
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
7 
                                         
 
Applicant failed to resolve his federal income tax over a 10-year period. He owes 
about $7,000 to a creditor for a vehicle following an accident in 2013. His explanations 
are insufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 59 years old, and he has worked as a tool engineer for 24 years. He 
has a bachelor of science degree. In 1982, he married, and his two children are ages 25 
and 29. He has worked for defense contractors for 28 years. He has not been unemployed 
for the previous 14 years. He is dedicated to his family and a diligent employee who 
makes important contributions to his company. He has held a security clearance for 23 
years, and there is no evidence of any security violations. Circumstances beyond his 
control adversely affected his finances including his spouse’s unemployment for two or 
three years.  
 
Applicant has owed federal income taxes since 2005. His current federal income 
tax debt is $125,000. He has also owed $7,000 for a vehicle since 2013. He mentioned 
several payment plans he had with the IRS; however, he did not provide documentary 
proof of any payments under those plans. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative 
judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether 
the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises 
to begin and complete making payments. The primary problem here is that Applicant has 
owed federal income taxes since 2005; he continues to owe substantial federal taxes; 
 
8 
                                         
 
and he has not provided any documentary proof of progress in the resolution of his federal 
income tax debt.3    
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he 
may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance 
worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  
                                            
3The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”).

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
