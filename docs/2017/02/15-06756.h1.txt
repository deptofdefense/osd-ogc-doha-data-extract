MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not timely file federal income tax returns for several years initially 
because of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from deployments in a war zone for the 
U.S. military but more recently because of procrastination. He filed his delinquent income 
tax returns in May 2016, and he intends to comply with his income tax filing obligation in 
the future. Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On March 4, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006.

On March 31, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On May 19, 2016, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On May 19, 2016, I scheduled a hearing for June 15, 
2016. With the agreement of the parties, on May 25, 2016, I moved the hearing to June 16, 
2016. 
 
I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) and 
eight Applicant exhibits (AEs A-H) were accepted into the record without objection. 
Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 24, 2016. 
 
I held the record open for one month after the hearing for additional documentary 
submissions from Applicant. On June 30, 2016, Applicant submitted 12 exhibits, which 
were admitted into the record as AEs I-T without objection from the Government. The 
record closed on July 7, 2016, when Department Counsel expressed no objection to the 
post-hearing exhibits. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file his federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g), and that Applicant owed 
$3,000 in past-due property taxes for tax year 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.h) as of March 2016. When 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that he had yet to file his income tax 
returns for the tax years alleged, but that he had hired an accountant to complete his 
returns for him. He indicated that he would have his delinquent returns filed by June 1, 
2016. He denied owing the property taxes alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h and presented a receipt 
showing the taxes had been paid.  
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old test technician, who has worked for his current employer 
since June 2014. (GE 1; Tr. 41.) He is a high school graduate and has never been married. 
Applicant served honorably and with distinction on active duty in the U.S. military from 
February 2001 to September 2005. He held a secret clearance for his duties in the U.S. 
military. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 20.)  He has a Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) disability 
benefit of 30% from his service (AE J; Tr. 45), which included deployments to the Arabian 
Peninsula from September 2002 to December 2002 (AEs K-L; Tr. 27-28) and to Iraq from 
November 2003 to March 2004. (AE O; Tr. 27-29.) Applicant received the highest ratings 
possible in all areas of his duty performance while he was in the service. His superior 
during his 104 days in theatre in support of Southern Watch and Enduring Freedom in 
2002 commented that Applicant was always there when needed, “anytime, anyplace.” (AE 
L.) He was variously described in his evaluations as a hard-charger, an excellent leader, a 
superior maintainer. No task was too large for him. Applicant was consistently 
recommended for immediate promotion (AEs K-Q) and awarded a military achievement 
3 
 
medal in April 2004 for his contributions in Iraq. (AEs I, P.) He served a second deployment 
in Iraq from December 2004 or January 2005 to May 2005. (Tr. 30-32.) Almost nightly, 
Applicant came under fire from small arms, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and 
mortars while in Iraq. (Tr. 31-33.)  
 
In mid-September 2005, Applicant was given temporary orders to deploy as a 
civilian to Afghanistan for 179 days. (AE R.) Applicant worked as a field technician in 
Afghanistan from September 2005 to February 2006 for a defense contractor. His work 
took him to several forward operating bases. (GE 1; Tr. 33-35.)  On his return to the United 
States, he took a two-month break to de-stress from his demanding work in Afghanistan. 
(Tr. 36.) In April 2006, Applicant began working as a technician for a contractor. Applicant 
resigned from his job in October 2006 because of a contract dispute over his pay.  He 
joined a labor union and worked on construction jobs when he could get work. (GE 1; Tr. 
38-39.) 
 
Around 2007, Applicant began having difficulty coping with daily living. He had 
nightmares, was “very jumpy,” and became very moody. (Tr. 37.) At the urging of his 
brother, Applicant sought assistance through the VA in 2009 or 2010. (Tr. 42.) He was 
diagnosed with PTSD and awarded a service-connected disability of 30% around April 
2010. (AE J; Tr. 25-27, 38, 42.) It took him a long time to recover, partially because he 
chose not to take psychotropic medications. (Tr. 26, 42.) He had some counseling sessions 
with a psychiatrist, which he did not continue after early 2011. (Tr. 42-43.) He still 
experiences symptoms of his PTSD on occasion, particularly if he disagrees with 
management about how a job should be done. He copes by taking a breath, walking away, 
or talking with his mother. (Tr. 44.) 
 
Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2014 when they 
were due,1 initially because of his PTSD but later because of “procrastination.” (Tr. 26.) He 
had no earned income for 2008. (Tr. 22.) In 2009, his wages totaled only $10,379. (AE B.) 
In 2010, Applicant’s wages totaled $29,315. (AE C.)  
 
Applicant worked for a defense contractor in Afghanistan from March 2011 to 
December 2011. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) His wages totaled $90,211 in 2011 (AE D), and as with 
previous years, he knew he didn’t owe any money. (Tr. 26.) He knew that he was required 
to file a tax return, but procrastinated and did not file an income tax return when it was due. 
(Tr. 26, 46.) He was also focused on assisting his mother, who needed financial help at 
that time. (Tr. 48.)  
 
 Applicant returned to his construction job with the union in 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 40.) He 
earned $21,586 in 2012 (AE E) and $14,937 in 2013. (AE F.) He also collected 
unemployment compensation of $2,159 in 2013. (AE F.) In June 2014, Applicant began his 
current employment. (GE 1.) His wages for 2014 totaled $14,397. (AE G.) 
 
                                                 
1 Applicant lives in a state that has no state income tax so he is not required to file state income tax returns. 
(Tr. 62.) 
4 
 
On January 26, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for security clearance eligibility. 
Applicant responded affirmatively to an inquiry into whether he had failed to file or pay any 
federal, state, or other taxes in the last seven years. He indicated that he had not filed his 
federal income tax return for tax year 2008 because of financial difficulties and that he had 
failed to pay $3,000 in local property taxes (SOR ¶ 1.h). In response to inquiries concerning 
any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant disclosed that he had defaulted on a 
$220,000 mortgage loan, which led to foreclosure. (GE 1.) Applicant explained at his 
hearing that he had owned a home from 2007 to January 2009. He was renting out the 
house and his tenants “just disappeared.” (Tr. 62-63.) 
 
On March 4, 2016, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant, alleging that he 
failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2014 and that he 
owed the $3,000 in past-due property taxes. On the recommendation of a friend, Applicant 
retained the services of an accountant for $1,200 to prepare his delinquent federal returns 
for him. (Tr. 24, 60.) This friend had referred him to the accountant initially around 2014, 
but Applicant “just kept pushing it back.” (Tr. 51-52.) By late March 2016, Applicant had 
provided the accountant with all the paperwork needed to file his income tax returns for tax 
years 2008 through 2015, and he had resolved his delinquent property tax debt. (Answer.) 
 
On April 4, 2015, Applicant’s accountant finished Applicant’s 2015 federal income 
tax return, which he filed on time. (AE H; Tr. 57.) On earned wages of $57,923 for 2015, he 
expected a tax refund of $991. (AE H.) 
 
 On May 12, 2016, Applicant’s accountant finished preparing Applicant’s income tax 
returns for tax years 2009 through 2014. (AEs B-G.) Applicant was advised by his 
accountant that he was not required to file an income tax return for 2008 because he had 
no earned income that year. (Tr. 22-23.) Based on the income tax returns that Applicant 
filed in May 2016 (Tr. 19), he overpaid his federal income taxes by a total of $9,747 for tax 
years 2009 through 2014. (AEs B-G.) As of mid-June 2016, Applicant had received his 
expected income tax refunds of $1,630 for 2012 and $991 for 2015. (Tr. 58.) 
 
At his hearing, Applicant accepted full responsibility for not filing his income tax 
returns on time. (Tr. 46.) Concerning his future intent about filing his income tax returns, 
Applicant stated: 
 
File taxes—I’m a mature, responsible adult now. I got a good job, and I think 
things are turned around for me. Just take responsibility and file my taxes. 
You know, that’s what everyone’s supposed to do. And just—if I have issues 
coming in, like I plan on seeing—going to the VA, just kind of just sit down 
and talk and just explain things. Because, what I was told [that] the VA was 
there to get you back into society as a functioning member. And I want to go 
there and tell them that things are getting better and if they take away my 
disability—that was a goal. To get me back into the workforce as a 
functioning adult. (Tr. 61.) 
 
5 
 
Applicant owes medical debt of approximately $551 that has been in collection since 
March 2011. (GE 2; AE A.) He has no credit cards or outstanding loans. (GE 2; Tr. 48-49.) 
He pays his mother $1,000 towards her rent each month. (Tr. 49.)  He receives VA 
disability income of $400 a month. After paying his monthly expenses but nothing toward 
the medical collection debt, he has about $354 in monthly discretionary income. (AE A.) 
Applicant drives a 2001 model-year vehicle that has been “pretty reliable.” (Tr. 51.) 
 
 Applicant works overtime when needed for his employer. (AE T.) The lack of help at 
work causes his PTSD symptoms to surface once in a while. (Tr. 53.) He wanted to obtain 
an updated assessment from the VA, but he has been too busy at work. (Tr. 46.) In rating 
Applicant’s performance for 2015, Applicant’s manager described him as “a real team 
player [who] always has the interests of the company at heart.” Applicant was given a 
rating consistent with his “outstanding accomplishments and contributions.” (AE T.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
6 
 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet  
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 As of the issuance of the SOR on March 4, 2016, Applicant had not filed his federal 
income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2014 as alleged, although it appears that he 
was not required to file a return for tax year 2008. Applicant believed he owed no taxes 
based on his history, and his delinquent returns for 2009 through 2014 bear that out. Even 
so, he knew that he was required to file returns irrespective of whether he owed taxes. His 
failure to comply with his income tax filing obligation triggers disqualifying condition AG ¶ 
19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” 
 
 The SOR also alleges that he owed delinquent property taxes of approximately 
$3,000, apparently based on his SF 86 disclosure. However, Applicant denied that he 
owed any property taxes when he answered the SOR, and he provided proof of a zero 
balance for the parcel. It is unclear when that debt was paid. The evidence falls short of 
establishing AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” or AG ¶ 19(c), “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply because of the pattern and recency of Applicant’s noncompliance with his 
tax filing obligation. 
 
 Applicant’s initial neglect of his income tax filing obligation is reasonably attributed to 
his PTSD. Although he did not provide evidence confirming the diagnosis, his repeated 
deployments are chronicled in his enlisted performance reports, his DD Form 214, his 
7 
 
September 2005 orders, and his candid testimony. The award of a 30% disability benefit 
from the VA tends to substantiate his testimony about the diagnosis, although the VA 
benefit letter confirming the disability does not identify its nature other than that it is service 
connected. Applicant’s PTSD surfaced around 2007, and he did not seek treatment from 
the VA until 2009-2010. He learned some coping mechanisms through counseling with a 
psychiatrist, which he discontinued in early 2011. Yet his PTSD was not so severe as to 
prevent him from working as a civilian contractor at a forward operating base in 
Afghanistan from March 2011 to December 2011. While it is understandable that he would 
fail to give priority to his income tax filing obligations for 2009 and 2010 when he was in 
Afghanistan, he has not been deployed since 2011 and his income has exceeded the 
threshold required to file a return each year.2 His income declined substantially from what 
he had earned in 2011, and he assisted his mother financially. Even so, he knew that he 
had not complied with his income tax filing obligation, as he so informed a friend in 2014. 
This friend referred him to an accountant, whose services Applicant did not retain until 
March 2016. Applicant’s procrastination in filing his income tax returns in recent years is 
not a circumstance outside of his control that could implicate AG ¶ 20(b), which provides: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 Concerning income tax issues specifically, the Appeal Board has long held that the 
failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-established 
government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 
2016); ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). Applicant shows some 
reform under AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control,” in that he filed his delinquent tax returns in May 2016. He filed his tax return for 
2015 on time. Applicant has accepted full responsibility for not complying with his tax filing 
obligation, and he intends to comply with his obligation to file his tax returns on time in the 
future. 
 
 The Appeal Board had held that even where an applicant has corrected his federal 
tax problems and is motivated to prevent such problems in the future, the administrative 
judge is not precluded from considering an applicant’s trustworthiness in light of 
longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 
at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). Applicant testified that he first contacted the accountant about 
preparing his delinquent returns a couple of weeks before he answered the March 4, 2016 
SOR. (Tr. 24.) A letter from the accountant dated March 29, 2016, notes that Applicant had 
                                                 
2 The income thresholds for filing for a single person under 65 were $9,350 in 2009 and 2010, $9,500 in 2011, 
$9,750 in 2012, $10,000 in 2013, and $10,150 in 2014. See www.irs.gov. Applicant’s wages totaled $10,379 in 
2009 (AE B), $29,315 in 2010 (AE C), $90,211 in 2011 (AE D), $21,586 in 2012 (AE E), $14,937 in 2013 
($17,096 with his unemployment, AE F), and $14,397 in 2014. (AE G.)

retained her services and provided the documentation necessary to file his tax returns.3 
Applicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2016. The evidence suggests that Applicant 
retained the accountant around the time that he received the SOR. The timing of his 
remedial actions suggests that he would not have taken action to file his delinquent returns 
if it had not become an issue for his security clearance eligibility. Applicant’s timely filing for 
2015 is not much of a track record of compliance in light of his prior history. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).4 The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant testified persuasively to his intent to fulfill his responsibilities as a mature 
adult in the future, and to seek help at the VA if necessary. He served with distinction with 
the U.S. military in Iraq, in austere and stressful conditions, displaying abilities exceeding 
his pay grade. That service came at some personal cost to his mental health, and yet he 
returned to Afghanistan as a civilian contractor for nine months in 2011 to assist the U.S. 
military at forward operating bases. While his contributions to national security in the 
context of high-risk circumstances do not excuse his disregard of such an important 
obligation as filing taxes, Applicant has shown through his record of reliability under 
stressful conditions and his demeanor at his hearing that he can be counted on to abide by 
his commitments. He is not likely to jeopardize his employment that has helped him turn his 
life in a positive direction by ignoring his tax filing obligation in the future, particularly where 
he now has a relationship with an accountant that can assist him in that endeavor. 
 
 It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Applicant 
certainly would have a stronger case in mitigation had he taken the advice of his friend and 
retained his accountant in 2015. By then, his income had stabilized sufficiently to where he 
should have been able to retain the tax preparer. At the same time, a determination of an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific 
                                                 
3 The letter from the accountant is considered as part of Applicant’s answer to the SOR. 
 
4 The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
9 
 
past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of the evidence to determine if a 
nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. For the reasons 
noted above, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
