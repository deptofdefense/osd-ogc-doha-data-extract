MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 25, 
2015. On February 5, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on March 1, 2016, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case 
on April 13, 2016. On April 15, 2016, a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and 
submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. He 
received the FORM on April 22, 2016, and did not respond. The case was assigned to 
me on February 6, 2017.

Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant is 54 years old and has been married for 32 years. Three of his four 
children are over the age of 21 years. The youngest child is 19 years old. He was 
honorably discharged in 1984 after serving on active duty with the Air Force for four 
years. He has been employed full time with the same federal contractor since 2004. 
Prior to that, Applicant was employed full time as a civilian with the Air Force from about 
1986 through 2004.2  
 
In his SOR Answer, Applicant denied six of the nine SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 
1.c through 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i). As to the three admitted debts, Applicant claimed that one 
was resolved (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he was making payments to the other two creditors 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g). Applicant owes only seven of the nine delinquent debts alleged in 
the SOR totaling $93,352,3 all but $1,102 (SOR ¶ 1.c)4 of which is credit-card debt.  
 
Based on the information contained in the credit reports,5 I find that the creditor 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i was granted a judgment (SOR ¶ 1.a) for the same credit card that it 
previously charged off. I will consider them together as one debt totaling the amount of 
the judgment. Similarly, I find that the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was granted a 
judgment (SOR ¶ 1.b) for the same credit card that it previously placed for collection. I 
will consider them together as one debt totaling the amount of the judgment. I also find 
that the balances of the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d (now being held by a collection 
company) and SOR ¶ 1.h are $19,512 and $12,157, respectively. Thus, I resolve SOR 
¶¶ 1.e and 1.i in favor of Applicant.6 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 2006 with a credit limit of $8,800.7 The 
creditor charged off the account in 2010 in the amount of $10,761 (SOR ¶ 1.i),8 and in 
                                                          
1 I extracted these facts from Applicant’s answer to the SOR (Item 3), e-QIP (Item 4), and the summary of 
his personal subject interview (Item 6), unless otherwise indicated by citation to another item in the 
record.  I considered that Item 6 was not authenticated as required by Directive ¶ E3.1.20. However, 
Applicant was informed by Department Counsel that he was entitled to make corrections, additions, 
deletions, and updates to Item 6.  Applicant was also informed that he was entitled to object to 
consideration of Item 6 on the ground that it was not authenticated. His failure to respond to the FORM 
constitutes a waiver of any objection to Item 6. See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 
2016) (“Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely 
and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.”).  
 
2 The record does not contain information about his employment status between 1984 and 1986. 
 
3 SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d and 1.f. through 1.h 
 
4 SOR ¶ 1.c. is an automobile-loan account. See Item 5 at 4 and Item 7 at 4. 
 
5 Items 5 and 7 
 
6 When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative 
allegations should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 
2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).

2011 was granted a judgment of $10,466 against Applicant (SOR ¶ 1.a).9 In his SOR 
Answer, without providing any corroborating documentation, he claims that he paid this 
debt in full in January 2016 after making monthly payments of $300 to his creditor since 
2013. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 1998 with a credit limit of $24,600.10  
The creditor sent the account to collections in the amount of $16,219 (SOR ¶ 1.e),11 and 
in 2009 was granted a judgment of $20,759 against him (SOR ¶ 1.b).12 In his SOR 
Answer, without providing any corroborating documentation, Applicant claims that he 
has been making good-faith payments to his creditor. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened an automobile-loan account in 2007, and the creditor charged 
off the account in 2012 in the amount of $1,102 (SOR ¶ 1.c).13 In his SOR Answer, 
Applicant denied this debt on the basis that he did not recognize the account or the 
amount, and that he intended to dispute it with the credit bureau agencies. However, 
during his personal subject interview, he acknowledged this debt as a joint account with 
his wife, and that he intended to resolve it on or before April 2017 via monthly payments 
of $50. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 1998 with a credit limit of $19,000.14 
The creditor charged off the account in the amount of $18,424 (SOR ¶ 1.d),15 and 
transferred it to a collection company who reports a balance of $19,512.16 During his 
personal subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that he and his wife used this joint 
credit card to pay college costs and incidentals, and that he intended to resolve it on or 
before 2025 via monthly payments of $50. In his SOR Answer, he denied this debt on 
the basis that it was resolved through his wife’s bankruptcy proceedings, and that he 
intended to dispute it with the credit bureau agencies. This debt remains unresolved. 
  
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 2005 with a credit limit of $16,500.17  
The creditor charged off the account in the amount of $19,389 in 2009 and reports a

balance of $15,691 (SOR ¶ 1.f).18 In his SOR Answer, Applicant denied this debt on the 
basis that he did not recognize the account or the amount, that he had disputed it, and 
that he intended to dispute it further with the credit bureau agencies. However, during 
his personal subject interview, he acknowledged that he and his wife used this joint 
credit card to pay college costs and incidentals, and that he intended to resolve it on or 
before 2025 via monthly payments of $50. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 1995 with a credit limit of $11,700, and 
the creditor sent the account to collections in the amount of $13,665 (SOR ¶ 1.g).19 In 
his SOR Answer, without providing any corroborating documentation, Applicant claims 
that he has been making good-faith payments to his creditor. This debt remains 
unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 2001 with a credit limit of $12,300.20  
The creditor charged off the account in the amount of $13,667 in 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.h), and 
reports a balance of $12,157.21 In his SOR Answer, Applicant denied this debt on the 
basis that he did not recognize the account or the amount, that he had disputed it, and 
that he intended to dispute it further with the credit bureau agencies. However, during 
his personal subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that he and his wife used this 
joint credit card to pay college costs and incidentals, and that he intended to resolve it 
on or before 2025 via monthly payments of $100. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in 1984 with a credit limit of $15,100, and 
the creditor charged off the account in 2009 and transferred it.22 During his personal 
subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that he and his wife used this joint account 
for incidentals and home furnishings, and that he intended to resolve it on or before 
2025 via monthly payments of $50. This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant reported only two delinquent credit card accounts in his e-QIP, claiming 
that he was in the process of paying one and that the creditor canceled the other one. 
During his personal subject interview, after being confronted, Applicant admitted that he

22 This debt was not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to 
evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-
20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Therefore, I will consider it accordingly.

owed substantial additional delinquent debt. He claimed that he did not list this 
additional debt due to oversight.23  
 
Applicant attributes his delinquent debt to the use of high-interest credit cards to 
pay for three of his children’s college expenses (tuition, costs, transportation, and other 
incidentals). He acknowledges that he was financially overextended and that this debt 
was not incurred due to circumstances beyond his control. In 2014, Applicant financed a 
$13,614 vehicle for 60 months with a monthly payment of $238. 
 
Applicant has received credit counseling, the details of which are not contained in 
the record. In the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that he had not 
provided any documents in support of the assertions made in his SOR answer or a 
personal financial statement, monthly budget, or recent pay stub. Department Counsel 
advised Applicant of his opportunity to provide these documents and others in his 
response to the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
                                                          
23 Applicant’s failure to disclose this additional delinquent debt on his e-QIP was not alleged in the SOR. 
See Footnote 22 above concerning conduct not alleged in the SOR. 
 
 
6 
 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 
 
7 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit bureau reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s numerous delinquent debts remain 
unresolved and have persisted since at least 2009.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant did not incur any debt due to 
circumstances beyond his control.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Although Applicant has received some type of 
financial counseling, his debt remains unresolved. Since Applicant did not respond to 
the FORM, the record contains insufficient detail and documentation about his ability to 
repay his debt, the reasons that it has persisted, and his plan to address it. Therefore, I 
cannot conclude that his financial problems are under control.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Because his claims are unsubstantiated by 
corroborating documentary evidence, I cannot conclude that Applicant is working with 
his creditors, that he resolved the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, that the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.d was resolved through his wife’s bankruptcy, or that he made payments to his 
creditors for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b or 1.g.  
 
 
8 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant does not have a reasonable basis to 
dispute the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, or 1.h given that he acknowledged and 
took responsibility for them during his personal subject interview.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(a). Because Applicant requested a 
determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his 
credibility and sincerity based on demeanor.24 After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of 
the whole person (including Applicant’s lack of complete candor about the state of his 
financial indebtedness in his e-QIP), I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, he has not carried his 
burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.f – 1.h:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.i:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is denied.
