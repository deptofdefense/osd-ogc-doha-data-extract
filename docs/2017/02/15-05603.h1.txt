Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not make sufficient progress addressing her state and federal tax 
debts from tax year 2010. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 20, 2014, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On February 12, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, 
pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended 
(Regulation); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive 
information. (HE 2)  
 
On March 8, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she 
requested a hearing. (HE 3) On July 18, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was 
ready to proceed. On August 8, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On September 6, 
2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a hearing notice setting the 
hearing for October 5, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, 
the Government provided 7 exhibits; Applicant offered 13 exhibits; and all exhibits,  
were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 14-20; GE 1-7; Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A-M)  
 
On October 12, 2016, I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.). On November 9, 
2016, Applicant submitted eight documents, which were admitted into evidence without 
objection. (AE N-AE U) On November 9, 2016, the record closed.

to pay Applicant’s company, and her construction company became insolvent. (Tr. 22) 
In 2010, Applicant closed her company. (Tr. 35, 39-40) Applicant also worked as a 
realtor. (Tr. 28; AE N)    
 
In August 2011, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code, and in November 2011, her nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged. (SOR 
¶ 1.a response) Her bankruptcy listed $982,000 in unsecured nonpriority debts and 
$85,000 in federal income taxes as a priority debt. (Tr. 38-39; GE 7) Applicant was able 
to retain her home and vehicle. (Tr. 22) 
 
In September 2012, a state filed a tax lien seeking $29,725 from Applicant for 
taxes owed for the 2010 tax year. (Tr. 41; SOR ¶ 1.b response; GE 6) She said some 
payments to the state were made and her tax refunds were intercepted. (Tr. 41) She 
said she would provide copies of her tax returns to show the payments to the state from 
other tax years. (Tr. 41) She said she made an initial payment of $1,500, and she paid 
at least $200 monthly. (Tr. 42; AE N) She said the balance was reduced to $25,000. (Tr. 
43) The documentation she provides shows a $225 payment on December 7, 2014, and 
12 $200 payments from June 2015 to June 2016. (AE G; AE H) The balance owed as of 
February 2016, was $32,136. (AE H; AE I; AE J; AE K)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant has a student loan for $25,646 that is $2,659 past 
due. From 1997 to 2014, Applicant received repeated forbearances and deferments on 
her student loans. (AE T) In July 2016, she began a loan rehabilitation program for a 
student loan, and she is supposed to pay $122 monthly. (AE L) From August 2014 to 
November 2016, Applicant made 17 payments on a student loan account totaling 
$4,961. (AE T) She is now making monthly payments of $200 to address her student 
loan account. (Tr. 31, 43-45; AE T) She believes the balance owed on her student loan 
is now $23,000. (Tr. 46) Applicant is credited with mitigating her student loan debt. 
 
Applicant has two medical debts for $1,320 and $80 alleged as delinquent on her 
2015 credit report. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) On September 29, 2016, she paid the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. (Tr. 47-49; AE A; AE B) She made three $440 payments for 
medical debts from September 30, 2016, to October 29, 2016. (AE Q) Applicant is 
credited with mitigating the two medical debts. 
 
In 2009 and 2010, Applicant decided not to pay the employee portion of her 
company’s Social Security and Medicare taxes, and she said she used the funds to pay 
her employees’ salaries. (Tr. 35)2 She and her husband owed about $85,000 to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for federal business taxes. (Tr. 31, 35; GE 7) In 2012, 
Applicant made an offer in compromise to the IRS to pay $2,795 as an initial payment 
and $11,180 within five months of acceptance of the offer. (Tr. 31, 36; AE M) In 
February 2013, the IRS wrote Applicant indicating her offer in compromise was 
                                            
2Applicant said she failed to pay taxes owed under an IRS Form 941. This document is used to 
show and provide the employer’s quarterly portion of employees’ Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
See IRS website, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f941.pdf. Her Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured 
Priority Claims, for her bankruptcy indicates a “Disputed” $85,000 “Business Income Tax.” (GE 7)

accepted. (AE M) Applicant said she paid $13,975 from her retirement account to 
resolve the IRS debt. (Tr. 32, 54) She said she would provide proof of payment to the 
IRS after her hearing. (Tr. 32-34) She did not provide proof of payment. Her husband 
still owes his share of this tax debt. (Tr. 54) She has timely filed all of her federal tax 
returns. (Tr. 50) She believes her federal income tax debts are current. (Tr. 33)  
 
After her hearing, she provided three IRS tax transcripts. (AE R-AE T) For federal 
income tax year 2012, Applicant and her spouse had $100,240 of adjusted gross 
income, $8,141 of income tax, federal tax withheld of $11,227, and refund of $3,086. 
(AE R) For federal income tax year 2013, Applicant and her spouse had $138,407 of 
income, $13,601 of income tax, federal tax withheld of $12,921, and amount owed of 
$680. (AE S) For federal income tax year 2014, Applicant and her spouse had $156,573 
of adjusted gross income, $18,188 of income tax, federal tax withheld of $16,738, and 
amount owed of $1,450. (AE T) 
 
Applicant and her spouse have about $29,000 in their retirement accounts. (Tr. 
26) They purchased a new truck in 2013, and their payments on it are current. (Tr. 27) 
She received financial counseling as part of her bankruptcy. (Tr. 50-51) 
 
Applicant provided a budget. (AE P) Applicant and her husband have $6,900 of 
net monthly income, monthly expenses and debt payments of $6,516, and a net 
monthly remainder of $384. (AE P) Her budget includes $2,600 monthly mortgage 
payments, $200 monthly student loan payments, and $200 monthly state tax payments. 
(AE P) No payments were included in their budget to address their federal tax debt for 
tax year 2009 and 2010.   
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Five of Applicant’s supervisors provided character statements on Applicant’s 
behalf. They have worked closely with her for periods ranging from 18 months to 
several years. They described her as compassionate, dedicated, diligent, trustworthy, 
professional, responsible, loyal, and empathetic to patients. She is respectful of patient 
privacy and conscientious about compliance with rules. (AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE 
U)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.

Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7, C3.1.2.2, and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of national security and sensitive records is paramount. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
  
The Appeal Board, in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted), explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations 
trustworthiness concern as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s SOR 
response, credit reports, bankruptcy filings, and hearing record establish the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important mitigating information. Four circumstances beyond Applicant’s control 
adversely affected her finances: (1) her husband was injured and unable to work; (2) 
during the recession, her business declined and became insolvent; (3) her child did not 
pay her student loans; and (4) she was unemployed before finding her current 
employment. After 2010, Applicant timely filed all required state and federal tax returns. 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

She made some payments to address her delinquent debts. She received financial 
counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. 
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The SOR 
alleges, and the record establishes that Applicant has owed federal and state income 
taxes since tax year 2009. Applicant said she paid $13,975 from her retirement account 
to resolve her share of the IRS debt for tax years 2009 and 2010, and she said she 
would provide proof of her payment to the IRS. She did not provide proof of payment, 
and her federal tax debt is unresolved. She failed to prove that she was unable to make 
greater progress paying her state tax debt for tax years 2009 and 2010.   
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s [trust]worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 
(App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s 
course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to 
support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax 
returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In sum, Applicant has owed federal and state income taxes since tax years 2009 
and 2010. Her explanations do not fully mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness 
concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant is a 59-year-old administrative coordinator employed by the same DOD 
contractor since February 2011. In 1975, she married, and her children are ages 36 and 
42. Five of Applicant’s supervisors described her as compassionate, dedicated, diligent, 
trustworthy, professional, responsible, loyal, and empathetic to patients. She is 
respectful of patient privacy and conscientious about compliance with rules. Her 
character statement support approval of her access to sensitive information.  
 
Four circumstances beyond Applicant’s control adversely affected her finances. 
She received financial counseling, and most of her delinquent debt was resolved in 
2011 through her bankruptcy. She is credited with paying her medical debts and making 
payments to address her student loan debt.  
 
When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax 
returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete 
making payments.4 In this instance, there is no evidence that Applicant failed to timely 
file her tax returns. The primary problem here is that Applicant has owed delinquent 
taxes since tax years 2009 and 2010, and she failed to establish her federal tax 
problems are being resolved. She said she settled her federal tax debt from 2009 and 
2010 in 2013; however, she did not provide proof that she paid the settlement to the 
IRS. She did not establish that she was unable to make greater payments to resolve her 
state tax debt from tax years 2009 and 2010.     
 
                                            
4The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security and trustworthiness concerns arising from 
tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of 
security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then 
taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant 
has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected 
of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 
2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of 
access to sensitive information. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of access to sensitive 
information to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform 
necessary for award of a public trust position in the future. With a track record of 
behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her worthiness for a public trust position.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
