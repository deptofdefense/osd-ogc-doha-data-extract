Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has four unresolved tax liens totaling $27,696 filed in 2005 and 2012. In 
addition, he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2005, 
2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. Applicant misunderstood the question about federal taxes 
on his March 12, 2014 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security 
clearance application (SCA) when he incorrectly denied that he had delinquent taxes, and 
he denied that he failed to timely file his federal tax returns. Personal conduct security 
concerns are mitigated; however, financial consideration security concerns are not 
mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 12, 2014, Applicant completed and signed an SCA. (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On March 2, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations and personal conduct guidelines. 
 
On May 9, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
July 18, 2016, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On August 8, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On September 6, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for October 
5, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.    
  
Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; and 
all proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 20, 27-34; GE 1-5) Applicant 
explained that he was not conceding he falsified his SCA. (Tr. 32-33) On October 12, 
2016, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. A post-hearing delay was granted 
until October 27, 2016, to permit Applicant to provide additional information about his 
finances. (Tr. 58) On November 30, 2016, Applicant provided 11 exhibits, which were 
admitted without objection. (AE A-AE K)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.e, and he denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. He also provided extenuating and 
mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he has worked as a field service technician for a 
company since 2008. (Tr. 11, 38) In 1979, he graduated from high school, and in 1983, 
he received an associate’s degree in computer repair. (Tr. 12) He served in the Army from 
1987 to 1989, and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 13) In 1987, he married, and 
he was subsequently divorced. (Tr. 14) His children are ages 28 and 32, and he does not 
have any children living in his home. (Tr. 14-15) He has never held a security clearance. 
(Tr. 37) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant repairs computers and terminals for his employer. (Tr. 38) He is 
sporadically paid by the job, and recently he has not received any income. (Tr. 39) He 
does odd jobs such as cutting lawns to earn income. (Tr. 40) He does not have any money 
in his bank accounts. (Tr. 40) He does not own any vehicles, and he receives $127 
monthly in Section 8 housing assistance. (Tr. 40-41) He has not received any credit 
counseling. (Tr. 50) He “had plenty of times” when he was unemployed. (Tr. 53) The 
evidence from Applicant’s credit reports, SOR response, Office of Personnel 
Management personal subject interview (OPM PSI), and hearing record establish the 
following status for his SOR debts: 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

Applicant accepted responsibility for the telecommunications-collection debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.a for $556, and he said he would pay it when able to do so. (Tr. 35-36) The debt 
accrued two or three years ago. (Tr. 41) He negotiated a cell-phone plan with the creditor. 
(Tr. 42) He eventually rejected the cell-phone plan. (Tr. 42) 
 
The SOR alleges and Applicant acknowledged responsibility for four tax liens 
totaling $27,696 as follows: ¶ 1.b for $9,267 entered in 2005; ¶ 1.c for $8,586 entered in 
2012; ¶ 1.d for $4,668 entered in 2012; and ¶ 1.e for $5,175 entered in 2012. For several 
years Applicant brought his tax documentation to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and 
the IRS prepared his tax returns. (Tr. 54) He said he did not understand why the IRS 
changed from giving him refunds to wanting more funds. (Tr. 49, 57) More recently he 
had difficulty finding tax assistance. (Tr. 55) He said he filed all of his tax returns, except 
for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36, 48) Applicant was unable to answer specific questions at his 
hearing about the basis for the tax liens because he did not have the documentation he 
sent or received from the IRS at the hearing. (Tr. 44-46) Applicant said around 2014, he 
had an agreement with the IRS in which he does not have to make any payments until he 
is financially able to do so. (Tr. 35, 46-47, 57)

Generally, filing an extension for taxpayers residing inside the United States results 
in an extension limited to six months after the April 15 due date following the tax year, 
and the six-month extensions are automatic.3

Personal Conduct 
 
Section 26, Financial Record, of Applicant’s SCA asks in the past seven (7) years: 
have “you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or 
ordnance?” (GE 1)  Applicant answered “no” to this question. Applicant denied that he 
understood the question, and explained he had a payment agreement with the IRS. All 
his tax returns are filed, and he does not have to pay any taxes. (Tr. 51-52; HE 2) Because 
of his payment agreement with the IRS, “all of that is like null and void.” (Tr. 51) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
5 
                                         
 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, and hearing record. AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) 
failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” AG ¶ 19(g) is not established. The record established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
                                         
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some important 
positive financial information. Applicant was unemployed or underemployed for several 
years. He acknowledged his delinquent debts, and he said he intends to pay his debts.    
 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
7 
                                         
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.5 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns 
against him as a federal crime.6 
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The SOR 
alleges and Applicant acknowledged responsibility for four tax liens totaling $27,696 filed 
in 2005 and 2012. In addition, the record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. His 
income was below the filing threshold in 2012. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
                                            
5Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without 
regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 
479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United 
States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
6Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 
2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the 
Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)).  
Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal tax returns for six tax years from 2003 to present will not be 
considered except for the five purposes listed above.

Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. 
June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversal: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
The negative financial and judgment information in Applicant’s case is significant. 
The record established that Applicant has owed four tax liens totaling $27,696 since 2012. 
He has owed federal taxes since 1998 as indicated by his tax year 2005 and 2006 refunds 
being diverted to pay 1998 taxes, and the 2005 tax lien for $9,267. He did not disclose 
any payments to address his tax debts. In 2014, the IRS put Applicant’s case into an 
uncollectible status. This IRS determination is insufficient to fully mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns.

Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case. AG ¶ 16(a) provides, “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to 
conduct investigations, [or] determine security clearance eligibility. . . .”7 
 
 Applicant answered “no” to financial questions in Section 26 about his failure to file 
or pay federal income taxes. Applicant credibly explained he did not understand the 
requirement to report his delinquent taxes, tax liens, and failure to timely file his tax returns 
because the IRS had placed his tax debt in an uncollectible status, and he was not being 
required to make payments to the IRS. He has refuted the falsification allegation, and he 
did not intentionally provided false information on his SCA with intent to deceive. See also 
AG ¶ 17(f) (stating, “the information was unsubstantiated . . . .”). Personal conduct security 
concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden 
of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he has worked as a field service technician for a 
company since 2008. In 1979, he graduated from high school, and in 1983, he received 
an associate’s degree in computer repair. He served in the Army from 1987 to 1989, and 
he received an honorable discharge. In 1987, he married, and in 2007, he was divorced. 
His children are ages 28 and 32, and he does not have any children living in his home. 
He has never held a security clearance.  
 
Applicant presented some positive financial information. Circumstances beyond 
his control adversely affected Applicant’s finances. He was unemployed or 
underemployed for several years. He acknowledged his delinquent debts, and he said he 
intends to pay his debts.   
 
Applicant has four tax liens totaling $27,696 filed in 2005 and 2012. In addition, he 
failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 
2009, and 2011. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to 
consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates 
the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and 
complete making payments.8 The primary problem is Applicant failed to timely file several 
                                            
8The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and

tax returns, has owed taxes since 1998, and failed to provide evidence of payments since 
2007.     
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he 
may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance 
worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal 
conduct security concerns are mitigated; however, financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
