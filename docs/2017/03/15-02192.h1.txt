Decision

METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 6 November 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 13
April 2016, and I convened a hearing 2 June 2016. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 7
June 2016.
Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-6, and Applicant exhibits (AE) A-E. AE D-E1
were timely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 11 July 2016, the day Department Counsel
indicated no objection to AE E.
DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20,2
1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on
1 September 2006. 
1
Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 46-year-old steam fitter
employed by a defense contractor since January 2010, a job which requires this
clearance. He also owns two companies, an air duct company he started in October
2006 (GE 1), and a construction company he started in May 2015 (Tr. 28). He does not
earn significant income from his companies.
Applicant married in June 1995, and has a son born in September 2003. He
seeks to retain the clearance he obtained in November 2007, and which was upgraded
in April 2008, after a favorable adjudication in March 2008.  This appears to be a3
periodic reinvestigation of that clearance.
Applicant’s March 2008 decision was based on a September 2007 SOR that
alleged five delinquent debts, one of which was paid before the SOR was issued, and
four of which were included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan filed on 19 July 2007 and
confirmed on 19 November 2007 (GE 6). Applicant was to pay the trustee $850
monthly. After his 18 December 2007 hearing, the judge found that Applicant was
making the payments as required. Since the SOR debts had either been paid, or
included in the current Chapter 13 plan, and Applicant had caught up on some non-
SOR debts that had fallen delinquent during the pendency of the Chapter 13, the
administrative judge granted Applicant’s clearance. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy
trustee’s 9 April 2010 periodic report to debtor (AE C) showed that Applicant paid
$27,410.30 to the trustee, reducing his base minimum required payment from $51,080
to $23,669.70.4
Applicant reported his Chapter 13/Chapter 7 bankruptcy case on his July 2012
clearance application (GE 1),  along with $6,500 in delinquent Federal taxes for tax5
years 2009-2010 that he had been paying since April 2009.  He did not report the SOR6
debts he thought were included in his Chapter 7 discharge.
Beyond the 2008 DOHA decision, the SOR alleges, GE 1-6 establish, and
Applicant admits, three delinquent debts totaling $15,700 (SOR 1.a-1.c). Applicant also
admitted that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan that had been favorably adjudicated in
March 2008 had been converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case on 7 June 2010, the
ISCR Case No. 07-06530, 28 March 2008. Except as noted herein, I incorporated the March 2008 decision3
by reference.
Although Applicant could have satisfied his remaining creditors with a $19,472.17 payment,4
In the amount of $517,000.5
He stated that his payment plan was $200 monthly, and he was deducting $50 weekly from his paycheck.6
Applicant’s 20 April 2016 (AE A) and 15 June 2016 (AE C) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monthly statements
show that Applicant is current on his payments, which are now for tax years 2011-2012, and his balance is
declining.

Chapter 7 trustee had filed a report of no distribution on 15 July 2010, and the case had
been discharged on 15 September 2010 (SOR 1.d).
Applicant’s 9 December 2015 Answer (Answer) stated that the April 2010
judgment for $240 (SOR 1.a) had been included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However,
Applicant did not submit his Chapter 13/Chapter 7 schedules to confirm that claim. The
Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee’s 9 April 2010 periodic report to debtor (AE C), does not
list this account. At hearing, Applicant acknowledged that this debt was not in the
bankruptcy (Tr. 53-56). After the hearing (AE D), Applicant discovered that the judgment
was for a parking ticket for a vehicle owned in 2008, and not included in his bankruptcy
discharge. He paid the ticket on 6 July 2016 (AE E).
Applicant also stated that the May 2007 tax lien for $12,566 (SOR 1.b) had been
included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. That allegation was based on an entry in
Applicant’s July 2012 credit report (GE 3) which did not identify the creditor except by
address. However, during his 23 October 2012 interview with a Government investigator
(GE 2), Applicant identified this tax lien as belonging to a local Government,  and this7
creditor appears in AE C as the local government office of tax and revenue with a stated
claim amount of $12,451.85 and a current balance of $2,550. Applicant testified that the
delinquent taxes date back to 2005, when he lived in the locality. He stated that his
contacts with the locality indicated that the current balance was about $1,100, but he
provided no proof of that claim and had no plans to pay the debt off (Tr. 40-43).
Finally, Applicant stated that the July 2013 judgment for $2,893 (SOR 1.c) had
been paid on 22 December 2014. That judgment appears on Applicant’s February 2015
(GE 4) and February 2016 (GE 5) credit reports along with a June 2013 judgment for
$1,326 by the same creditor. Each case has a distinct case number. Applicant’s Answer
contains a 23 December 2014 court record that a case number corresponding to the
June 2013 judgment was satisfied by garnishment order issued on 12 March 2012.
Applicant submitted a 2 March 2016 merged in-file credit report (AE D) showing four
different accounts, each with a zero balance and no money past due. AD D does not
show when the accounts were paid.
The tale of Applicant’s financial problems began in 2006, when he bought a
house that was on the high end of what he could afford. This was at the height of the
housing market. He was not particularly worried that making the payment was a stretch
for him because he was expecting a new job and anticipated that he would be able to
refinance the mortgage into a more manageable payment in a couple of years (GE 2).
The new job never materialized and the crash of the housing market meant he could not
refinance the mortgage, resulting in the April 2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing (Tr. 32-
33). The Chapter 13 portion of the bankruptcy failed because he was helping his sister
He told the investigator that he had been paying the local government $100 monthly, but stopped when he7
moved to his new home in another locality (Tr. 44). He assumed the taxes had been resolved by his
bankruptcy discharge because he did not hear from the local government after his bankruptcy discharge.

take care of their elderly mother in the mother’s house. His mother and sister now live
with him.
Applicant takes home about $1,100 weekly. He gets overtime in his job, but has
not been getting a lot of it lately. Consequently, the $1,100 is on the low end of his
annual income, which ranges from $87,000 to $140,000 annually. He estimates that his
wife takes home $2,500-2,600 bi-weekly. They have about $400-500 positive monthly
cash flow (Tr. 59-67).
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant has ongoing issues with his Federal
taxes. When he submitted his clearance application, his delinquent taxes were for 2009-
2010. His current payment plan is for 2011-2012 (AE A, D). He owes Federal taxes
every year because he has not adjusted his withholding to cover what he owes.
Consequently, he incurs late-payment penalties and interest (Tr. 46-52). The IRS just
rolls the new tax debt into his payment plan. However, Applicant does not believe he
owes for 2013-2014 (AE D). He was on an extension and had not filed his 2015 taxes
(Tr. 51).8
Applicant had the financial counseling required by his bankruptcy filings. He did
not provide a budget. He provided no work or character references, or any evidence of
community involvement.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person’s suitability for
access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is
not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case
can be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or
denial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the
burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case. 
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Because the tax issues were not alleged in the SOR, I have not considered them on the merits of this case.8
However, I have considered them on the general issue of Applicant’s credibility, absence of mistake, or
evidence of plan or pattern.
4
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels deciding any
reasonable doubt about an Applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.9
                                   
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has had significant financial
problems since before his March 2008 clearance decision and has continued to have
them since.  Applicant continued to make the required Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan10
payments for three years until he became unable to make the payments because of the
financial assistance he was providing to his sister and elderly mother. Applicant
converted his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in April
2010, and was discharged of his dischargeable debts in September 2010. However,
although his local tax lien was included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan for purposes
of paying off the debt, he had to have known, based on his bankruptcy financial
counseling that the debt could not be discharged along with his other debts. Applicant
took no steps to learn the status of this debt until after he received the SOR, and did not
provide evidence of the claimed status. Moreover, Applicant continued to have financial
problems after his fresh start. He had a judgment for a parking ticket that was not
included in his bankruptcy discharge, and he acquired two new judgments in June and
July 2013.11
In addition, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial
considerations. His financial difficulties are recent, not infrequent, and ongoing.  While12
the circumstances that caused the indebtedness that was addressed in the 2008
decision were beyond his control, part of the rationale for granting his clearance was the
fact that he was resolving those debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, which
would pay at least some of the indebtedness. However, his inability to maintain the
payments was because of his decision to provide financial support to his sister and
elderly mother, a difficult choice, but a choice nevertheless. That choice caused him to
convert his bankruptcy plan to a bankruptcy discharge which was accomplished in
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).9
¶19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;10
Because the June 2013 judgment was not alleged in the SOR, I have not considered it on the merits of this11
case. However, I have considered it on the general issue of Applicant’s credibility, absence of mistake, or
evidence of plan or pattern. Furthermore, record evidence shows that this judgment was satisfied, by
garnishment, before the SOR was issued.
¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that12
it is  unlikely to recur . . . ;

September 2010. Notwithstanding his new start, he acquired new debt after the hearing
and let that account not only fall delinquent, but be reduced to judgment. He was
partially responsible with the un-alleged June 2013 judgment because he satisfied it by
garnishment before the SOR was issued. However, his resolution of the alleged July
2013 judgment is not as clear, because while his merged in-fille credit report suggests
that it has been satisfied, it does not establish when it was satisfied.  Further, he did13
nothing to investigate the status of his local tax lien after his bankruptcy discharge, and
having ostensibly learned its current status, states an intent not to pay it, which is hardly
a good-faith effort to resolve it.  14
The concern with Applicant is that any action taken to address the SOR debts
was undertaken after the SOR was issued. One debt was paid after the hearing; one
debt was paid at an unknown date; and a third has not been addressed at all. The
Government is not the collection agent of last resort. The Government expects
applicants to deal with their delinquent debts because of their legal and moral obligation
to do so, not because they face the risk of adverse administrative action. He has stated
no intent to resolve his remaining local tax lien, and certainly has not demonstrated that
this delinquent debt is being resolved in an expeditious manner.  Further, he has no15
work or character references to establish a “whole-person” analysis supporting a
favorable clearance action. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs a-c: Against Applicant
Subparagraph d: For Applicant
Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
