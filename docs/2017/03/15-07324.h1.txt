MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on November 12, 
2014. On April 28, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on June 1, 2016, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 24, 2016, 
and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason on October 19, 
2016. On January 9, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 3, 2017. On January 31, 2017, 
Judge Mason transferred the case to me and I convened the hearing as scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Government’s exhibit list was appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 
I. At the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through 
D, which were admitted without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open 
to March 3, 2017. Applicant timely provided additional documents that I admitted as AE 
E without objection.1 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2017. 
 
SOR Amendment 
 
 At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel’s motion, without objection from 
Applicant, to amend the SOR to conform to Applicant’s testimony at the hearing.  I 
added ¶ 1.h to the SOR, as follows: 
 
h. You failed to file or pay your federal tax returns, as required, for tax years 
2010, 2011, and 2012.”2 
 
At hearing, after being offered additional time to respond to the new allegation 
SOR ¶ 1.h, Applicant admitted to the facts alleged therein.3  
 
Findings of Fact4 
 
Applicant, age 40, has never been married and has no children.5 He has been 
cohabitating with his girlfriend since 2014. He received his high school diploma in 1994. 
He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from 1994 through 1997. 
 
Applicant is a security officer and has been employed full time since January 
2016.6 He also works a part-time job on the weekends.7 Before that, he had been 
unemployed for about a year and a half following an unexpected layoff in January 
                                                          
1 By email dated March 6, 2017, I requested that Applicant identify to which SOR allegation each 
document in AE E refers. I did not receive any response to that email. Accordingly, I have attributed each 
document in AE E to SOR allegations as appropriate given the context of the record.

about when he started this part-time position (Tr. at 55). However, he did not provide such information.

2013.8 He did not collect unemployment compensation during that period.9 Applicant 
currently maintains a secret clearance and has applied for an upgrade to top secret.10 
 
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted to each of the original seven SOR 
allegations totaling $15,278. He attributes these debts to his layoff, which was the only 
time that he was ever unemployed since he separated from the Navy.11  
 
Applicant’s landlord asked him to vacate his apartment after he told them that he 
was laid off and could not afford to pay the full amount of his rent. The outstanding 
balance that he owes to the landlord is $6,557 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He plans to contact the 
landlord to discuss a settlement or payment plan. The debt is unresolved.12  
 
Applicant fell behind in his payments on an automobile loan in the approximate 
amount of $2,066 (SOR ¶ 1.b). He still maintains possession of this vehicle13 and made 
regular payments towards the balance due until it was paid off. This debt is resolved.14  
 
Applicant fell behind in his payments on a personal loan in the approximate 
amount of $2,731 (SOR ¶ 1.c). He has been making regular payments towards the 
balance due. There remains a balance of $764 to be paid. This debt is in the process of 
being resolved.15  
 
Applicant fell behind in the payments for his cell phone in the approximate 
amount of $686 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and for another phone bill in the approximate amount of 
$297 (SOR ¶ 1.e). He planned to pay these outstanding amounts in February 2017. 
However, both debts remain unresolved.16  
 
State A obtained three judgments against Applicant for his failure to pay his 
taxes, in 2002 in the amount of $2,173 (unalleged debt),17 in 2007 in the amount of 
                                                          
8 Tr. at 25-26, 31-32, 47-48. I left the record open, in part, to afford Applicant the opportunity to provide 
me with a timeline of his work history since he filled out his e-QIP (Tr. at 55).  However, he did not provide 
such information.

$2,745 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and in 2012 in the amount of $1,666 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Although the 
amount of $1,196 is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, I find that the total amount of the judgment 
granted was $1,666, including interest and penalties.18 The 2002 judgment was 
released in 2008.19 Applicant believes that he has paid the amounts owed to State A in 
full.20 However, he has not provided any corroborating documents in support of his 
claim beyond a writ of garnishment issued in September 2016 to his employer in the 
amount of $864,21 and an uncorroborated claim that he was paying $300 a month for 
some undescribed period of time through his former employer.22 The 2007 and 2012 
judgments remain unpaid. 
 
In October 2016, State A certified that Applicant owed outstanding debt of $4,669 
to its Insurance Lapse and State Highway Administration agencies (unalleged debt),23 
and also stated its intent to intercept Applicant’s state income tax refunds to apply 
toward that debt.24 Applicant paid $2,970 to State A for outstanding debt owed to the 
Insurance Lapse agency in 2008.25 I cannot determine whether the information on 
pages 3 and 4 of AE E ($2,970 debt) relates to the information in AE D ($4,669 debt). 
However, for the purposes of evaluating mitigation, the discrepancy is not material. I 
find that Applicant owed non-tax related debt to State A and paid a portion of it.26 
 
Applicant failed to timely file and pay his federal and state taxes for tax years 
2010 through 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.h).27 He also owes unpaid taxes for tax years 2013 and 
2014 (not alleged),28 and failed to timely file his tax return for tax year 2007 (not

24 AE D. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that the debts contained in AE D totaled $1,196 and, therefore, 
related to SOR ¶ 1.f (Tr. at 43-46). However, the math adds up to $4,669 and do not relate to unpaid tax 
debt so I do not find that AE D relates to SOR ¶ 1.f. 
 
25 AD E at 3-4. 
 
26 I also note that “Paid Conf#164754” is in handwriting on AE E at 5 (which is a statement that is also 
part of AE D). While Applicant did not provide any documents corroborating his payment, I consider it 
generally as stated.

alleged).29 Without providing any corroborating documentation, Applicant claims that he 
became current with his state and federal tax return filings in 2016.30 Applicant entered 
into a five-year installment agreement to repay this debt at some point,31 which was 
revised in April 2016 to $444 per month.32 Applicant did not provide any documents to 
corroborate any payments that he made pursuant to that agreement. He also did not 
provide any documents to corroborate the amount owed for these unpaid taxes, which 
he estimated to be approximately $40,000.33 Applicant attributes his failure to timely file 
and pay his taxes to being “young and ignorant” and not paying attention to them,34 and 
gave no other compelling excuse or reason.35 He acknowledged that he paid his taxes 
and used a tax service to assist with filing his taxes while he was in the Navy.36 
 
Applicant travelled to a foreign country in 2010, 2011, and 2013.37 At the hearing, 
when asked how he financed these trips, Applicant responded “I can’t answer that.”38 
Applicant has not sought or received financial counseling.39 Applicant earns 
approximately $4,500 to $5,000 after taxes each month from his two jobs.40 From that, 
he pays one-half of the $650 per month rent and also contributes, when asked, to the 
utility bills, the amount of which varies. He does not have any automobile expenses 
because he is presently using a family member’s car.41 Applicant expected to receive a 
“vacation cash-out” in February 2017 of approximately $1,000 from which he planned to 
repay some of his delinquent debt.42 However, Applicant did not provide any evidence 
that he either received this sum or, if he did, that he used it to repay debt.

During his U.S. Navy service, Applicant earned a National Defense Service 
Medal, an Armed Forces Service Medal, an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, a SEA 
Service Deployment Ribbon, and a Navy Efficiency Ribbon.43 Applicant has never been 
reprimanded for security breaches.44 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v.

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). Once the Government establishes 
a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to 
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the 
burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to 
the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit bureau reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 
19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same”). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
 
8 
 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that 
remain unresolved. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant’s sudden job loss in 2013 was a 
circumstance beyond his control. However, Applicant has failed to meet his burden to 
show that he has acted responsibly to resolve his debt since then.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not received financial counseling. 
While Applicant has made some strides in tackling his delinquent debt, I cannot 
conclude that his financial problems are under control at this time. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Applicant is credited with resolving the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, for paying a substantial sum towards the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.c, and for arranging an installment agreement with the IRS to resolve his delinquent 
tax debt. However, these efforts fall short of establishing AG ¶ 20(d) in light of the 
record as a whole.  
 
Without any compelling excuse or reason to do so, Applicant failed to timely file 
and pay his federal taxes over a number of years, which reveals a deficiency in his good 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. This conduct further calls into question his 
suitability for access to classified information. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his 
or her legal obligations, such as filing income tax returns when due, does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 18, 2015). “Failure to file income tax returns suggests that an applicant has a 
problem with complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(a). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his financial indebtedness and his failure to timely file and pay 
federal taxes. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.b – 1.c:  For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.d – 1.h:  Against Applicant 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is denied.
