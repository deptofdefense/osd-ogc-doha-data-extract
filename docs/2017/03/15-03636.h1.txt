GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 10, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On November 10, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications 
and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and

detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On December 11, 2015, he responded to the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on an unspecified date in March 2016, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the 
FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines 
applicable to his case. Upon receiving the FORM, Applicant changed his mind, and on 
March 30, 2016, he requested that the matter be converted to a hearing. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on May 5, 2016. The case 
was assigned to me on June 6, 2016. Unbeknownst to me, on June 13, 2016, pursuant 
to Directive ¶ E.3.1.13, Encl. 3, Department Counsel issued an Amendment to the SOR.2 
It was never received by Applicant.3 A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 28, 2016. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled on July 12, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE H, were admitted into evidence without objection. A 
copy of the proposed Amendment to the SOR, redated July 12, 2016, was handed to 
Applicant, and it was marked as an Administrative Exhibit.4 The proposed Amendment to 
the SOR was subsequently withdrawn during the hearing.5 Applicant testified. The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on July 20, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant 
to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted additional 
documents, which were marked and admitted as AE I through AE Q, without objection. 
The record closed on July 26, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted six of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h.) of the SOR. 
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration 
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
                                                          
2 Because the “proposed” Amendment to the SOR was issued after the case was assigned to me, I believe 
the authority for the document was erroneously cited as ¶ E.3.1.13., whereas it should have been ¶ E3.1.17.

Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a logs 
and records clerk with the company since May 2013.6 He was previously a general clerk 
with another company from June 2010 until April 2013, and briefly served as a part-time 
security guard before that.7 He is a 1997 high school graduate.8 He received an 
associate’s degree in 2013 and a bachelor’s degree in 2015.9 Applicant enlisted in the 
U.S. Navy and served on active duty from September 2001 until September 2005, when 
he was honorably discharged.10 It is unclear when he was granted an interim secret 
security clearance.11 Applicant was married in 2003.12 He has two sons (born in 2005 and 
2008), one daughter (born in 2012), and one stepson (born in 2001).13 
 
Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his military career, Applicant was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, 
the National Defense Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, 
the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary 
Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and a Letter of Commendation. He was also 
the Squadron Sailor of the Month.14   
 
Financial Considerations15 
In January 2008, Applicant obtained a bank loan in the amount of $290,000 to 
finance the construction of a new residence. The payments were $2,300 per month. He 
made his routine loan payments until early 2009. Unfortunately for Applicant, at about 
that time, the housing market collapsed. His original primary residence had still not yet 
been sold, but was rented. Applicant could no longer afford both mortgages. He 
refinanced the loan to a $1,900 monthly payment, but even that reduced amount was too

15 Applicant’s memory regarding the dates that specific incidents took place is rather poor in that he contended 
certain incidents took place at different times as reflected in his e-QIP, Personal Subject Interview, and during the 
hearing. General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following 
exhibits: GE 1, supra note 1; GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 21, 2013);

much for him. He also tried a short sale, but that effort proved to be unsuccessful. As a 
result, the mortgage payments on the new residence ceased and, in September 2009, 
Applicant moved back into his original residence. The new residence went into 
foreclosure, leaving an unpaid balance of $161,299. The creditor reclaimed the collateral 
(the residence) to settle the defaulted mortgage.16  
In July 2008, Applicant purchased a Harley Davidson motorcycle for $10,579, with 
monthly payments of approximately $250. In June or July 2009, Applicant lost his job due 
to a company reorganization. He enrolled in a police academy in September 2009, 
graduated in March 2010, and obtained part-time weekend employment in April 2010. 
When Applicant lost his job, he fell behind in his monthly motorcycle payments. It was 
voluntarily repossessed.17 Other accounts became delinquent. Although he had never 
received financial counseling,18 Applicant reached out to his known creditors, including 
those not alleged in the SOR, in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts.19 Although he 
nearly wiped out his entire savings account, he managed to settle nearly all of his 
accounts, in part by using his annual federal income tax refunds.20  
The SOR identified eight purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, as reflected by his June 2013 credit report21 or his March 2015 
credit report.22 Those debts, totaling approximately $15,071, and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a motorcycle loan with an unpaid balance of $5,400 that was 
placed for collection and charged off.23 The unpaid balance was the amount remaining 
after the motorcycle was voluntarily repossessed and sold. On December 7, 2015, the 
collection agent agreed to a settlement of $3,239.82,24 and on December 9, 2015, 
Applicant made a payment in that amount.25 The account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a bank credit card with an unpaid and past-due balance of 
$2,300 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.26 In early December 
2015, the debt purchaser agreed to a settlement of $1,502.60 as payment in full.27 On 
December 9, 2015, Applicant made a payment in that amount.28 The account has been 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.e.): These are two medical accounts with unpaid and past-due 
balances of $978 and $525 that were placed for collection with the same collection 
agent.29 In early December 2015, the collection agent agreed to settlements of $377 and 
$525,30 and on December 8, 2015, Applicant made a payment in the amount of $906, 
which is $4 more than necessary, as payment in full.31 The accounts have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $798 that was 
placed for collection.32 Applicant had attempted to locate the unidentified creditor, but he 
was unable to do so. He has not filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency. The 
account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a medical account with unpaid and past-due balance of $249 
that was placed for collection.33 On December 8, 2015, Applicant made a payment in the 
amount of $249.17 as payment in full.34 The account has been resolved. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a medical account with unpaid and past-due balance of 
$1,610 that was placed for collection.35 Applicant had attempted to locate the unidentified 
creditor, but he was unable to do so, even though the name, address, and telephone 
number of the collection agent appears in his June 2013 credit report. He has not filed a 
dispute with the credit reporting agency. The account has not been resolved. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is a bank credit card account with a high credit of $2,316 and 
an unpaid balance of $3,200 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.36

In August 2012, the debt purchaser reported that the remaining balance was $3,045.28, 
and it offered Applicant settlement terms under which a lump sum payment of $2,000 
would be acceptable as settlement in full.37 It is unclear when Applicant actually made 
that lump sum payment because he did not receive an acknowledgment of the payment 
or a letter stressing that the payment was in full, as previously agreed, until February 
2016.38 In fact, Applicant’s June 2013 credit report clearly stated that there was a zero 
balance as the account had been “legally paid in full for less than the full balance” – a fact 
that was known when the SOR was drafted and issued two and one-half years later. That 
fact also appeared in Applicant’s March 2015 credit report.39 
In July 2016, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a 
family net monthly income of $4,770; monthly expenses of $4,051; and a monthly 
remainder of $719 available for saving or spending. He also listed $87,390 in savings 
(after refinancing his residence in March 2016), $446 in a checking account, and $6,500 
in retirement accounts.40 Applicant has made substantial progress in resolving his 
delinquent accounts, including several that were not alleged in the SOR. Other than the 
two unresolved medical accounts identified above, there are no remaining delinquent 
debts. It appears that Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly, and that his 
financial problems are finally under control.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 The commanding officer and the quality assurance officer of Applicant’s previous 
employer both enthusiastically support Applicant. They noted that Applicant 
demonstrated a tireless work ethic, created stability, and routinely went above and 
beyond.41 A retired chief petty officer, who served as the aviation administrative manager 
on active duty when Applicant was assigned to him, described Applicant’s great attention 
to detail, punctuality, maturity, focus on his duties, and willingness to help others when 
needed. Their subsequent relationship, as government contractors, simply reinforced 
earlier positive impressions, and Applicant was characterized as “an anchor, an important 
team member that we depend on daily to keep our many programs safe and on track.”42 
Applicant’s somewhat dated performance review for the period ending in June 2011 rated 
him as excellent in all of the 18 performance factors, including judgment/decision making, 
flexibility and adaptability, and problem solving and creativity.43

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”44 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”45   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship

46 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”48 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”49 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s major financial problems initially arose in early 2009, and 
increased during early portion of the following year. Accounts became delinquent. Some 
were placed for collection. A house was foreclosed, and a motorcycle was repossessed. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition

9 
                                      
 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”50 In addition, 
AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all apply. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by his personal frivolous or irresponsible 
spending. Also, it does not appear that he spent beyond his means. Instead, his financial 
problems arose at about the time the national housing market collapsed, he was unable 
to sell his initial primary residence, and he was unable to continue making monthly 
mortgage payments on both that residence and his newly constructed residence. The 
loss of his job in mid-2009 merely exacerbated his financial situation. Applicant 
commenced his task of resolving his debts, limited largely by an inability to generate the 
funds to do so more expeditiously. He reached out to his creditors and, where possible, 
he negotiated settlements or paid accounts in full. He exhausted his savings and applied 
his annual income tax refunds to settle or otherwise pay off a number of accounts.  
 
Of the eight SOR-related accounts, he resolved all but two medical accounts 
because he could not identify the actual creditors or collection agents. While he never 
received financial counseling, Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly. He 
recently refinanced his residence mortgage and now has $87,390 in his savings account. 
Applicant’s financial problems are finally under control. While he may have been initially 
unable or possibly unmotivated to move more timely in addressing his SOR-related 
accounts, Applicant’s successful efforts actually reflect that he acted prudently and 
                                                          
50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances confronting him, no longer cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.51 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.52       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain his normal monthly payments regarding a number of his accounts, and during 
2009 and the ensuing years, a number of them became delinquent and were placed for 
collection. A house was foreclosed and a motorcycle was repossessed.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant is a decorated, honorably 
discharged veteran. He is a well-respected employee of at least one government 
contractor. Applicant’s financial problems commenced with his ill-timed decision to 
construct a new residence at about the same time that the national housing market 
collapsed. Unable to sell his initial primary residence, he was caught up in a situation 
where he was unable to make simultaneous monthly payments on the mortgages for two 
residences. When he lost his job in mid-2009, he was also unable to make the payments 
for his motorcycle. Without the financial resources to maintain his accounts in a current 
status, they became delinquent. He chose not to ignore his delinquent debts. Instead, he 
exhausted his savings and applied his annual income tax refunds to settle or otherwise

pay off a number of accounts. The last eight delinquent debts were those included in the 
SOR. Of those eight SOR-related accounts, to date, he has resolved all but two medical 
accounts simply because he could not identify the actual creditors or collection agents. 
While he never received financial counseling, Applicant’s financial status has improved 
significantly. He recently refinanced his residence mortgage and now has $87,390 in his 
savings account. Applicant did not simply promise to address his debts, he actually did 
so.53  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 54 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. He keeps track of his expenses and maintains a budget. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s security worthiness. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
                                                          
53 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
