LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for 
access to classified information. She failed to file federal individual income tax returns 
on a timely basis for tax years 2009-2014. She also became indebted to the IRS in the 
amount of $7,510 for tax years 2009 and 2010, which she paid off in February 2016 via 
an installment agreement. Her tax problems are too much, went on too long, and are 
too recent to justify a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, this case is decided 
against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on May 15, 2013. This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. About three years later on May 16, 2016, after reviewing 
the application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified 
 
2 
 
information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on June 15, 2016, and she requested a hearing.  
 
The case was assigned to me on August 23, 2016. The hearing was held as 
scheduled on November 10, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1-4, and they 
were admitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf and offered Exhibits A-C, and they 
were admitted. The transcript of hearing (Tr.) was received on November 18, 2016.   
 
The record was kept open until December 9, 2016, to allow Applicant to present 
additional documentation. On November 25, 2016, she submitted two additional 
documentary matters, which are admitted as Exhibits D and E.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for her job 
as a data analyst for a company doing business in the defense industry.  
She has worked for this company since 2003. She married for the third time in 2012. 
She has four children and five stepchildren via her current marriage. Her household 
includes three teenage children, while the other six children range in age from 21 to 31. 
Her husband owns and operates a limousine/transportation service business.   
 
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the SOR allegations concern 
three primary matters: (1) an indebtedness of more than $7,000 to the IRS for back 
taxes for tax years 2009 and 2010; (2) failure to file tax returns on a timely basis for tax 
years 2009 through 2014; and (3) eight relatively small collection accounts for a total of 
$2,187. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted the tax problems, but noted she had 
paid off the back taxes to the IRS by February 2016, which was before the SOR was 
issued to her. She denied seven of the eight collection accounts and provided short 
explanations for each, although the collection accounts are established by a May 2013 
credit report.2  
 
Applicant attributes her 2009-2010 tax problems to the demands of being a 
single parent who lacked the money to pay the IRS what she owed at the time. She 
attributes her subsequent tax problems to filing a joint return with her husband whose 
business activities made the income-tax process more complicated. She further 
explained that she and her husband have retained the services of an accountant and 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in 
the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

they are now current with the income tax obligations. A review of tax records3 provided 
by Applicant follows below.  
 
For tax year 2009, she had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $112,710 and 
taxable income of $97,060. Her federal income tax return was filed late on about August 
27, 2012, after receiving an extension to October 15, 2010. The IRS imposed a penalty 
for filing the tax return after the due date and for late payment of tax, and charged 
interest for the late payment. She had an account balance due of $7,075.  
 
For tax year 2010, she had an AGI of $90,969 and taxable income of $71,619. 
Her tax return was filed late on or about August 27, 2012, after receiving an extension to 
October 15, 2011. The IRS imposed a penalty for filing the tax return after the due date 
and for late payment of tax, and charged interest for the late payment. She had an 
account balance due of $435.  
 
For tax year 2011, she had an AGI of $95,710 and taxable income of $76,110. 
She filed her tax return on or about August 27, 2012. There is no indication that the 
return was filed timely or late. She was issued a refund of $653 on October 1, 2012. 
 
Applicant’s filing status for the 2009-2011 returns was head of household. After 
filing those returns in August 2012, she then entered into an installment agreement with 
the IRS to repay $7,510 due for 2009 and 2010. The agreement was established on 
September 24, 2012, and thereafter she made monthly payments during 2012, 2013, 
2015, and 2016. The installment agreement was satisfied in February 2016.  
 
   For tax year 2012, based on her 2012 marriage, Applicant’s filing status changed 
to married filing joint. She and her husband had an AGI of $135,019 and taxable income 
of $100,079. The joint return was filed late on or about December 23, 2013, after 
receiving an extension to October 15, 2013. A payment of $3,075 was made with the 
return. The IRS imposed a penalty for filing the return after the due date and for late 
payment of tax, and charged interest for the late payment. After application of a credit 
from tax year 2011, a refund was issued in the amount of $11.44. 
 
For tax year 2013, she and her husband had an AGI of $95,846, a business loss 
per Schedule C of $10,058, and taxable income of $59,547. The joint return appears to 
have been filed late on December 31, 2015. A refund was issued in the amount of 
$10,120. 
 
For tax year 2014, she and her husband had an AGI of $63,979, a business loss 
per Schedule C of $41,824, and taxable income of $29,160. The joint return appears to 
have been filed late on March 22, 2016. A refund was issued in the amount of $15,688.  
 
Turning next to the eight collection accounts, Applicant did not produce any 
supporting documentation for the collection accounts. The $978 collection account 
stems from attorney’s fees for a custody dispute Applicant had in about 2005. She

believes the attorney misrepresented himself to her, did not communicate with her, and 
she was unsatisfied with the legal services he provided. She does not feel that she 
owes the attorney any money, and she does not intend to pay the debt. 
 
The $384 collection account stems from an account Applicant had with a tanning 
salon for herself and her daughter. After the one-year contract period had lapsed, she 
completed the necessary paperwork to cancel the contract and was told no further 
action was required on her part. She was subsequently called by a collection agency, 
explained the circumstances, and was told not to worry about it. She does not intend to 
pay this debt. 
 
The $237 and $119 collection accounts are discussed together because 
Applicant believes they related to the same television-service provider. She was unware 
of the basis for these two accounts and has heard nothing from the creditors.  
 
The $174, $76, and $75 medical collection accounts are also discussed together. 
She believes the $174 medical collection was paid, but knows nothing about the other 
two accounts. 
 
The $144 collection account stems from a ticket issued by a city government. 
Applicant believes she paid the account via electronic payment.  
 
Applicant presented an Equifax credit report and a TransUnion credit report, both 
from November 2016.4 None of the eight collection accounts in the SOR are reflected in 
the November 2016 credit reports.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.5 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”6 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.7 An

a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a 
security clearance).

unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.8 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.9 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.10 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.11 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.12 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.13 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,15 the suitability of an applicant 
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information.16 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(g) failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic 
financial history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. With that said, I 
have given little weight to the eight collection accounts for a total of $2,187. To begin, 
viewed cumulatively or individually, the collection accounts do not involve a significant 
or sizeable amount of money. Indeed, several of the accounts are for less than $200. 
Second, three accounts are medical collection accounts, which are presumed to have 
been incurred for necessary medical care as opposed to frivolous or irresponsible 
spending. Third, most of the accounts were incurred years ago and do not appear on 
the more recent November 2016 credit reports. And fourth, Applicant has provided 
sufficient explanations for the accounts even considering the absence of 
documentation. 
 
 The same cannot be said for Applicant’s history of tax problems. The repeated 
failure to file tax returns bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to 
the federal government.17 The evidence shows she failed to file returns on a timely 
basis for tax years 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014; I am unable to determine if her 
return for tax year 2011 was also late. This pattern of conduct is indicative of poor 
judgment and unreliability. This pattern of conduct also suggests that she has a problem 
with complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. An applicant who has a history of not fulfilling their tax obligations may be 
said not to have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability required for 
access to classified information.  
 
 I have considered Applicant’s efforts to fix her tax problems, and her efforts are 
not insubstantial. She repaid the back taxes for tax years 2009 and 2010 via an 
                                                          
17 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

installment agreement that commenced in 2012 and concluded in early 2016, she has 
filed the required returns, and she now appears to be in good standing with the IRS. 
She and her husband have retained the services of an accountant to assist them with 
their tax obligations. I also considered Applicant’s motivation, and I have no concerns 
that she is a tax protestor, is tax defiant, or is otherwise opposed to meeting her lawful 
tax obligations. Nevertheless, the favorable matters are outweighed by the nature, 
extent, and seriousness of the conduct. To sum up, Applicant’s tax problems are too 
much, went on too long, and are too recent to justify a favorable clearance decision.  
 
 Applicant’s history of tax problems creates doubt about her reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. In doing so, I gave 
substantial weight to Applicant’s many years of work in the defense industry. 
Accordingly, I conclude that she did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c-1.j:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
