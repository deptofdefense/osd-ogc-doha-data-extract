GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 21, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On November 24, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications 
and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed

reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 9, 2015. On December 19, 2015, he 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 22, 
2016. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
April 7, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 26, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, and 30 Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE AD, were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 5, 2016. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely 
submitted additional documents, which were marked and admitted as AE AE through AE 
AM, without objection. The record closed on June 17, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant specifically admitted only one of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶ 1.c.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, 
I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a project 
engineer with the company since April 2010. He was previously a systems engineer with 
another company from April 2006 until March 2010. He received a General Educational 
Development (GED) diploma in 1997 or 1998; an associate’s degree in 1999; and a 
bachelor’s degree in 2005. He has never served in the U.S. military. He has held a secret 
security clearance since 2008. Applicant was married in 2006. He has two children (a 
daughter born in 2008 and a son born in 2010). 
 
Financial Considerations2 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the period 2008 
through 2010 when a number of factors contributed to some degree of financial stress. 
With the birth of his two children, the family increased from two to four persons. The loss 
of his wife’s income in 2008, along with the increased family expenses, significantly 
impacted his entire budget. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that the homeowner 
association (HOA) fees on the residence he purchased in 2006 rose five to six percent 
                                                          
2 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following 
exhibits: GE 1, supra note 1; GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated January 8, 
2015); GE 2 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 6, 2015); GE 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March 15, 2016); 
GE 4 (Personal Subject Interview, dated March 16, 2015); Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated December 19, 2015. 
More recent information can be found in the exhibits furnished and individually identified.

each year, from $250 to about $380 – an amount greater than his salary raises. In 
addition, when he obtained his current position in 2010, he had to relocate his residence 
to a new city nearly 380 miles away. He simply could not pay the extra assessments and 
maintain two residences. In 2009 or 2010, Applicant simply stopped paying his HOA fees. 
In March 2010, the HOA sued Applicant and obtained a $1,755 judgment. In October 
2010, they sued him again and obtained a $4,360 judgment.3 Since Applicant no longer 
resided in the location of the residence or HOA, he was unaware of the lawsuits or the 
judgments.4 By November 2011, the unpaid balance, including late fees, had risen to 
$8,719.5 In early 2014, the HOA placed a lien on the residence, claiming Applicant owed 
the HOA about $18,000. 
 At some point in 2011, Applicant learned of the judgments and the lien, and he 
contacted the creditor in an effort to resolve the matter. At the time, he was unable to 
make a large lump-sum payment, but when he was able to do so, he made one $10,000 
lump-sum payment, and he entered into a repayment agreement under which he agreed 
to pay the HOA $680 each month until the entire amount is paid off.6 On March 23, 2015 
– eight months before the SOR was issued – Applicant used his income tax refund and 
paid the HOA $13,578, covering the arrears and $7,228.59 in legal fees.7 He also 
continued to make his monthly HOA payments until he eventually sold the property.8 On 
May 8, 2015, a Stipulation Discontinuing Action with Prejudice and a Stipulation 
Cancelling Notice of Pendency of Action were issued, signifying that the matter had been 
satisfied and the lien was cancelled.9 Considering the inaccuracy in the Equifax credit 
reports, and the discontinued action by the HOA, it appears that the judgments (or one 
judgment and one lien) alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b. were resolved in May 2015 – six 
months before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, Applicant’s 2015 and 2016 credit 
reports continued to report the judgments as unsatisfied. 
Another result of Applicant’s financial issues was his inability to continue making 
his monthly mortgage payments on the residence associated with the HOA. He remained 
in constant communication with the loan servicing company, but his efforts to resolve the 
matter were repeatedly unsuccessful. His October 2014 request for mortgage assistance 
still had not been resolved as of July 2015.10 In January 2015, Applicant listed the house

SOR, supra note 2, at 1. Strangely, both Experian and TransUnion reported the $4,360 judgment by the HOA, but 
Equifax reported it as a medical account.

for sale with a real estate agent.11 The original listing price was $235,000, but it was 
reduced to $225,000. He repeatedly sought approval for a short sale of the property, but 
the loan servicing company kept delaying a decision, requesting additional information, 
and potential purchasers withdrew their offers.12 An April 2015 offer for $210,00013 was 
seemingly ignored by the loan serving company.14 In November 2015, the loan was 
transferred to another servicing agent without any final action regarding a short sale being 
made.15 The new loan servicing agent on the first mortgage finally approved a short sale 
request for $170,184 on April 11, 2016.16 However, during the delay, Applicant sought 
assistance from the loan servicing company on the second mortgage, and on March 21, 
2016, it approved a short sale for $196,500.17 The settlement on the property was 
completed on June 13, 2016, with the established and approved price.18 The account 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. has been resolved. 
While attempting to resolve his mortgage issues, in 2009 and 2011, Applicant 
received financial guidance from one of his loan servicing companies.19 In May 2016, 
Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a family net monthly 
income of $4,251; monthly expenses of $3,200; and a monthly remainder of $316.93 
available for saving or spending.20 However, Applicant noted that his $380 monthly HOA 
payments would cease once his house sold. Since the house was sold the following 
month, Applicant’s monthly remainder is now $696.93. He also reported he has $4,000 in 
savings, $1,200 in checking, and $74,000 in his retirement 401(k). Applicant has made 
substantial progress in resolving his delinquent accounts. He keeps a budget. There are 
no remaining delinquent debts. It appears that Applicant’s financial status has improved 
significantly, and that his financial problems are finally under control.

technology officer, and the director of contract administration – facility security officer, are 
all extremely supportive of him. They generally characterize Applicant with terms such as 
honesty, integrity, trustworthy, highly professional, respected, energetic, compassionate, 
positive attitude, well-liked, reliable, personable, and unpretentious. They not only support 
his retention of a security clearance, but also his desire to advance through additional 
graduate study. Applicant is an excellent troubleshooter who is respected and well liked 
by management, coworkers, and the customer base.21 Applicant’s pastor reported that 
Applicant is active in his church, serving as a volunteer with children’s programs, a 
community kitchen, as well as in a variety of other congregation positions. He considers 
Applicant to be “a man of his word, a man of integrity, and a man of faith” who is trusted 
and held in high esteem.22 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”23 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”24   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”25 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.26  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”27 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”28 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
                                                          
25 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s significant financial problems initially arose in 2008, and 
increased during the following few years. Several accounts became delinquent. Two 
judgments were filed and a lien was placed on his residence. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”29  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all apply. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by his personal frivolous or irresponsible spending. Also, it does not appear 
that he spent beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems arose during a period 
when the family income dropped and his family grew from two to four individuals. His HOA 
fees increased. When he obtained a new job in another city, he found it difficult to maintain 
the expenses for two houses with the reduced income. He was unaware that the lawsuits 
                                                          
29 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

had been filed against him, having already moved to a different part of the state. Likewise, 
he was not aware that judgments had been filed or that a lien was placed against his old 
residence. When he eventually learned of his financial situation, he reached out to the 
HOA in an effort to resolve the judgments and lien. When he was able to do so, he made 
several lump-sum payments and entered into a repayment plan. He satisfied the 
judgments and they were cancelled, and the lien was withdrawn, eight months before the 
SOR was issued. Unfortunately for Applicant, the status of the resolved judgments and 
lien were never corrected in the credit reports, and his 2015 and 2016 credit reports still 
reflect that the judgments are unsatisfied. 
 
Applicant’s difficulties with his initial residence were caused by having a new job 
and a new residence in another part of the state. It was difficult to pay for both houses 
simultaneously, and Applicant sought assistance from the loan servicing company. His 
efforts to resolve the issues associated with the initial residence were unsuccessful when 
the loan servicing company was not timely in their responses and actions. Applicant listed 
the house for sale in January 2015, and he repeatedly sought approval for a short sale. 
The request was generally met with delays. Offers were made, but either ignored or 
rejected. Other offers were withdrawn because of unresponsive inaction by the loan 
servicing company. Finally, approval was granted by the loan servicing companies 
representing both the first and second mortgages. The property was sold on June 13, 
2016, and Applicant has no deficiency.  
 
Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly. He has no other delinquent 
debts. He received financial counseling. Applicant’s financial problems are finally under 
control. Considering the impediments placed in his way by the loan servicing company in 
resolving his mortgage issues, Applicant’s perseverance and successful efforts reflect 
that he acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances 
confronting him, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.30 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.31       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain his normal monthly payments regarding his mortgages and HOA assessments. 
Judgments were filed against him by the HOA, a lien was placed on his residence, and 
he fell behind in paying one of his mortgages on his initial residence.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. He is a well-respected employee and 
member of the community. Applicant’s financial problems commenced when his wife 
dropped out of the work force to start having children, and it got worse when he obtained 
a new position elsewhere in the state. The increased HOA fees and the expenses of two 
residences were simply too much for him to handle simultaneously. Without the financial 
resources to maintain his HOA status and a mortgage in a current status, they became 
delinquent. He chose not to ignore his delinquent debts. Instead, he extended himself to 
resolve the judgments well before the SOR was issued. Applicant’s efforts have been 
successful. He resolved his HOA issues and his mortgages issues. Applicant’s financial 
status has improved significantly. Applicant did not simply promise to address his debts, 
he actually did so.32  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
                                                          
31 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

32 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 33 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. He keeps track of his expenses and maintains a budget. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s security worthiness. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
