HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not make sufficient progress addressing her delinquent debts. She 
has owed federal and state income taxes since 2009. She has not made payments on 
her federal income tax debt since 2014. Financial considerations trustworthiness 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 11, 2014, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On June 10, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, 
pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended 
(Regulation); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive 
but unclassified information. (HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such access to sensitive information should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On June 30, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On August 29, 2016, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed. On October 13, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On December 22, 2016, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a hearing notice setting the hearing 
for January 19, 2017. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, the 
Government provided five exhibits; Applicant offered five exhibits; and all exhibits, 
except Government Exhibit (GE) 4, were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 
15-18; Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-5) On January 27, 2017, DOHA received the transcript 
of the hearing. On March 20, 2017, Applicant’s counsel informed me that Applicant was 
not going to submit any post-hearing documentation. (Tr. 53; AE 6)  
 
Applicant objected to GE 4, Applicant’s December 1, 2015 Equifax credit report 
because it is redundant with Applicant’s August 28, 2016 Equifax credit report. (Tr. 15-
16) I overruled Applicant’s objection because the consistency or redundancy between 
the two credit reports tends to show the credit reports are reliable. The two credit 
reports are not identical, and each report is a snap shot of Applicant’s financial condition 
when Equifax created these two credit reports. Each report provides relevant 
information about Applicant’s financial history.     
 
Findings of Fact1  
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that she denied all of the SOR 
allegations based on lack of information or belief. (HE 3)   
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old customer service representative or associate 
employed by the same employer since 2002. (Tr. 47; GE 1; AE 5) She moved into a 
public trust position in 2014. (Tr. 28) She has never married, and her children are ages 
11, 13, and 19. (Tr. 43, 47) She lives with the father of her three children and her three 
children. (Tr. 43-44) She has not served in the U.S. Armed Forces. (Tr. 47)  
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014, and she 
owed about $6,485 for delinquent federal income taxes and about $3,622 for delinquent 
state income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.d). 
 
 Applicant’s SOR and credit reports also allege 12 delinquent debts totaling 
$19,747 as follows: ¶ 1.e is a charged-off student loan debt for $12,252; ¶ 1.f is a

charged-off bank debt for $401; ¶ 1.g is a collection debt for $315; ¶ 1.h is a collection 
debt for $1,054; ¶ 1.i is a medical collection debt for $64; ¶ 1.j is a charged-off bank 
debt for $718; ¶ 1.k is a grocery store collection debt for $77; ¶ 1.l is a collection debt for 
$115; ¶ 1.m is a collection debt for $4,262; ¶ 1.n is a library collection debt for $78; ¶ 1.o 
is a jewelry store collection debt for $232; and ¶ 1.p is a collection debt for $179.

 Applicant acknowledged that she failed to withhold sufficient funds from her 
salary for her taxes in 2008. (Tr. 29) In 2010, she reduced her exemptions on her IRS 
Form W-4 and increased the funds withheld and sent to the IRS. (Tr. 30; AE 2) In 2009, 
she recognized that she owed a substantial tax debt, and she panicked. (Tr. 31) She 
was worried about losing her house. (Tr. 31) An accountant told her she did not have to 
file a tax return for three years. (Tr. 32) From June 2011 to July 2014, she made $126 
monthly payments to the IRS to address her IRS tax debt for tax year 2008. (AE 2) She 
does not know why her payments to the IRS stopped in July 2014. (Tr. 34-35) 
 
On July 25, 2016, the IRS wrote and advised Applicant that her debt for tax years 
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015 was placed in “currently not collectible” 
status. (Tr. 24; AE 4) (Applicant’s failure to pay her 2015 taxes when due is not alleged 
in the SOR and will not be considered in this decision.) Applicant said she thought the 
letter was advising her that she did not owe the IRS. (Tr. 24) The IRS letter said 
Applicant owes $6,722 for those seven tax years. (Tr. 48; AE 4) The IRS will continue to 
charge penalties and interest until the debt is paid in full. (AE 4) She understands now 
that still she owes the IRS debt. (Tr. 24) At the time of her hearing, she had not 
resumed her payments to the IRS. (Tr. 36) She timely filed her 2015 tax return. (Tr. 24; 
AE 1) 
 
 As for the state income tax debt of $3,622, Applicant’s monthly pay was 
garnished $60 or $30 since 2012, and her state tax debt has now been paid down to 
less than $1,000. (Tr. 25, 34, 38, 49) She said she planned to provide documentation 
after her hearing showing her progress reducing this debt; however, she did not provide 
the promised corroborating documentation. (Tr. 25) She said she plans to continue to 
make the payments on her state tax debt. (Tr. 38)

The charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.e is a student loan debt for $12,252. Applicant’s 
son was in the third grade and was having difficulty learning how to read at the third-
grade level. (Tr. 19) Her son is now 19 years old. (Tr. 19) She signed a contract at a 
learning center to pay about $7,000 with $2,800 down and $88 monthly. (Tr. 19, 52) The 
course was scheduled for six months; however, the local learning center, which is part 
of a chain of learning centers, closed after four months. (Tr. 19) She called another 
learning center in the chain, and the learning center did not have a record of her debt. 
(Tr. 40) The debt was initially about $3,200, and the debt was owed to an entity that 
provides student loans nationwide. (Tr. 20-21, 49, 53) The entity directly paid the 
learning center; however, the entity does not own or operate the learning center. (Tr. 
20) She acknowledged that if she cannot get a refund from the learning center she will 
have to pay the loan. (Tr. 49) She planned to dispute the debt. (Tr. 20-21, 38-39)   
 
The collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.m for $4,262 resulted when Appellant posted bail 
for her nephew 17 years ago. (Tr. 25-26) The bail company has gone out of business. 
(Tr. 25) She planned to dispute the debt. (Tr. 25-26, 39) 
 
She accepted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶ 1.n, a library collection debt 
for $78, and in SOR ¶ 1.o, a jewelry store collection debt for $232. (Tr. 26, 39) She did 
not accept responsibility for the other SOR debts. (Tr. 26, 39)  
 
In 2005, Applicant’s mother was killed by a drunk driver, and Applicant received a 
large wrongful death settlement. (Tr. 22) In 2006, she paid $100,000 from the 
settlement as a down payment on her home. (Tr. 22, 27) After two years, her mortgage 
monthly payment on her variable interest rate loan substantially increased. (Tr. 41) Real 
estate prices declined making it difficult for her to refinance her mortgage, and she was 
receiving less overtime pay. (AE 2) Her mortgage was refinanced; her mortgage is now 
$81,505; and it is now current. (Tr. 27, 41-42; AE 3) She has about $40,000 in her 
401(k) account. (Tr. 45-46) Her vehicle payment is also current. (GE 5) 
 
The only SOR debt receiving payments from Applicant is her state tax debt; 
however, she did not provide corroborating documentary evidence of her payments. (Tr. 
51) Initially, she indicated that after she pays her tax debts, she plans to file for 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 27, 40, 46) After further consideration, she said she would contact each 
creditor on the SOR; she would validate each debt; and she would attempt to resolve 
those debts that were valid. (Tr. 54) She intended to dispute the debts that were invalid. 
(Tr. 54) She intended to contact the IRS to see if she could begin making payments on 
her federal income tax debt. (Tr. 54) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 On January 18, 2017, the director of human resources for Applicant’s employer 
wrote that she “has always been an employee in good standing. She has not had any 
performance or attendance issues . . . . [She] has demonstrated she is a trustworthy 
employee.” (AE 5)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7, C3.1.2.2, and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information. 
   
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of national security and sensitive records is paramount. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
  
The Appeal Board, in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted), explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations 
trustworthiness concern as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s credit reports and hearing record establish the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,2 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
                                            
2 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
February 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
3 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) 
concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating 
conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important mitigating information. Three circumstances beyond her control adversely 
affected her finances: (1) she had difficulty making her house payments because the 
amounts of the payments on her mortgage were increasing; (2) real estate prices 
declined making it challenging for her to refinance her mortgage; and (3) she received 
less overtime pay. She filed all required state and federal tax returns. She made some 
payments to address her delinquent tax debts. She did not receive financial counseling 
or provide a budget. 
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s [trust]worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 
(App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an applicant’s 
course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to 
support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax 
returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant’s credit reports establish Applicant has 12 delinquent debts totaling 
$19,747. She did not provide enough details about what she did to address her SOR 
debts over the last four years. She did not provide documentation relating to any of her 
12 SOR debts: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, 
photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that she paid or made any 
payments to the creditors; (2) correspondence to or from the creditors to establish 
maintenance of contact;  (3) credible debt disputes indicating she did not believe she 
was responsible for the debts and why she held such a belief; (4) more evidence of 
attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement offers or agreements to show 
that she was attempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or 
resolution. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(e) because she did not 
provide documented proof to substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt 
disputes.

Applicant has owed federal income taxes since tax year 2008. She failed to 
withhold sufficient funds from her income to pay her taxes when due in six of the last 
eight tax years, and she currently owes $6,722 in delinquent federal income taxes. She 
owes a state tax debt of less than $1,000; however, she did not provide the requested 
proof of the status of her state tax debt. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, she failed to timely file 
her state and federal income tax returns. Her explanations do not fully mitigate financial 
considerations trustworthiness concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old customer service representative employed by the 
same employer since 2002. She has three children to support. Three circumstances 
beyond her control adversely affected her finances: (1) she had difficulty making her 
house payments because the amounts of the payments on her mortgage were 
increasing; (2) real estate prices declined making it challenging for her to refinance her 
mortgage; and (3) she received less overtime pay. Her mortgage is now current. She 
has about $40,000 in her 401(k) account. Her vehicle payment is also current. She 
disclosed her financial problems on her SCA. She filed all required state and federal tax 
returns. She made some payments to address her delinquent tax debts. The director of 
human resources for Applicant’s employer described her as “an employee in good 
standing. She has not had any performance or attendance issues . . . . [She] has 
demonstrated she is a trustworthy employee.” (AE 5) 
 
The negative financial information relating to her taxes is more significant. 
Applicant has owed federal and state income taxes since tax year 2008. She failed to 
withhold sufficient funds from her income to pay her federal income taxes when due in 
six of the last eight tax years, and she currently owes $6,722 in delinquent federal

income taxes. She said she owes a state tax debt of less than $1,000; however, she did 
not provide the requested proof of the status of her state tax debt. In 2010, 2011, and 
2012, she failed to timely file her state and federal income tax returns.   
 
When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax 
returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete 
making payments.4 The primary problem here is that Applicant has owed delinquent 
taxes since tax year 2008, and she failed to establish her tax problems are being 
resolved. In 2014, she stopped making payments to the IRS.     
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of 
access to sensitive information. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of access to sensitive 
information to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform 
necessary for award of a public trust position in the future. With a track record of 
behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her worthiness for a public trust position.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. 
                                            
4 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security and trustworthiness concerns arising from 
tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of 
security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then 
taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant 
has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected 
of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 
2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.p:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
