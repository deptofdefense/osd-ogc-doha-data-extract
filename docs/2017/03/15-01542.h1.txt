GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 22, 2014, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On September 27, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines For 
Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

2 
                                      
 
an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 16, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated October 26, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On February 25, 2016, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on March 23, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 28, 2016. I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on May 16, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, 19 Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE S, and 1 administrative exhibit were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant  testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 24, 2016. 
I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that 
opportunity and timely submitted additional documents, which were marked and admitted 
as AE T through AE X, without objection. The record closed on June 7, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to use the words “admit” or “deny” in 
responding to the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.q.) of the SOR. Nevertheless, Applicant’s admissions and comments are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a full-
time senior project leader and consultant for his employer since August 2012. He 
previously held a number of similar positions while self-employed or with other employers, 
including periods with an investment bank and a board of trade as a market maker and 
futures broker. He is seeking to obtain continuing eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. He is a 1974 high school graduate, and he 
earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1978 and a master of business administration degree 
in 1982. He never served in the U.S. military. Applicant was married in July 1978 and 
divorced in 1992; married again in 1999 and divorced in 2007; and married again in 2013. 
He has three sons, born in 1985, 1987, and 1991, and two stepdaughters, born in 1966 
and 1970.

Financial Considerations2 
 
Applicant was unemployed on several different occasions; he was self-employed 
from April 2004 until May 2008 when the recession of 2008 “destroyed” his business; he 
was unemployed from May 2008 until September 2010; his temporary job from 
September 2010 came to a conclusion in April 2011, and he was again unemployed from 
April 2011 until May 2011; he was self-employed working for another company from May 
2011 until that company went bankrupt in October 2011, and he was again unemployed 
until April 2012; and he was self-employed working for another company from April 2012 
until August 2012 when that company lost their contract. 
 
Over a period of time, because his annual salary plummeted from $60,000 to 
$70,000 to zero, and because Applicant had insufficient money to pay his bills and keep 
his accounts current, a number of his accounts became delinquent. Some were placed 
for collection, some were charged off, and others went to judgment. Federal and state 
income taxes went unpaid. Applicant reduced his expenses by necessity, and he 
eventually moved into a backyard shack owned by his sister, where he resided, rent-free, 
for 18 months. His mother assisted him financially with other necessities. Although he 
was overwhelmed and unsure what to do to resolve his financial issues, he established a 
repayment plan, starting with the smaller debts and intending to work up to the larger 
ones. He finally obtained financial counseling on such topics as your banking relationship, 
understanding credit and credit reports, your financial life for young adults, identity theft 
and predatory lending, introduction to borrowing, introduction to investing, and setting 
your financial goals and creating a budget. In his Response to the SOR, Applicant 
attributed several factors that combined to create financial difficulties for him: 
 
The “Great Recession” of 2008 had a massive and catastrophic 
effect on my financial life. As a result of this recession, I was out of work for 
almost 3 years. In addition, during this time frame, I went through a divorce. 
What was left was a man who was bankrupt in every sense of the word. 
However, I chose not to file for bankruptcy, but instead decided that at some 
point I will make good on all my debts. . . . 
 
Not all debts have been resolved yet, however I plan on having them 
resolved before the close of 2016. I want to note here that resolution of 
these items has been steady and consistent. The only reason there are 
some still outstanding is because of my financial bandwidth. I can only 
resolve so many at a time without creating a financial disjoint for myself. I 
would like to also note that of the 17 items, only 5 remain. 
 
                                                          
2 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following 
exhibits:  GE 1, supra note 1; GE 2 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 12, 2014); 
GE 3 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 6, 2015; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, 2015. More 
recent information can be found in the exhibits furnished and individually identified.

Going forward, I have made it a policy in my life to not incur any debt. 
I have been successful with this life policy. Anything that is needed or 
wanted, I save cash for and purchase it outright. 
The SOR identified 17 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $72,741, as reflected by Applicant’s June 2014 credit report and his 
February 2015 credit report. Several of the accounts alleged in the SOR appear to be 
duplicates or separate versions of the same account. Some of the accounts have been 
paid off or otherwise settled, some are in the process of being resolved, and a few of the 
accounts remain in an ambiguous status. The account numbers listed in the credit reports 
are inconsistent, with some listings only offering the first two numerical digits, some a 
string of numbers without the final few digits, and even others with completely different 
numbers associated with the collection agent, rather than the original creditor. The SOR 
identified account numbers for only 3 of the 17 accounts alleged. There is documentation 
to support many of Applicant’s contentions. Those debts and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:  
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.h., and 1.i. are held by the same collection 
agent/debt purchaser. SOR ¶ 1.a. refers to an unspecified type of bank account, thought 
to be a line of credit, with an unpaid and past-due balance of $27,919 that was placed for 
collection. On May 3, 2016, Applicant sent a letter to the collection agent seeking 
validation of the account because he denied ever having an account with the original 
creditor.3 There was apparently no response to the letter, as none was submitted to me 
by Applicant. That account remains unresolved.  
SOR ¶ 1.b. refers to a credit card account with an unpaid and past-due balance of 
$9,276 that was placed for collection. On May 3, 2016, Applicant sent a letter to the 
collection agent seeking validation of the account.4 There was apparently no response to 
the letter, as none was submitted to me by Applicant. That account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.i. refer to two snapshots of the same bank credit card account 
with an unpaid and past-due balance of $3,724, that was initially increased to $4,634 by 
the credit agent, and eventually to $4,858.84. The collection agent obtained a judgment 
in the amount of $5,793 in April 2014.5 At some point before October 1, 2014 – 
approximately 12 months before the SOR was issued – Applicant and the credit agent 
entered into a repayment arrangement under which Applicant agreed to make monthly

payments of $75 until the balance was paid in full.6 Applicant has made the required 
monthly payments since October 2014.7 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.h. refers to an unspecified type of bank account with a high credit of 
$1,564 that was placed for collection and a judgment was obtained in the amount of 
$1,643 in October 2012.8 The account was settled in full on November 12, 2012 – nearly 
three years before the SOR was issued.9 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.k. refer to two snapshots of the same bank credit card account 
with an unpaid and past-due balance of $966 that was placed for collection and charged 
off. The collection agent obtained a judgment in the amount of $823 in February 2010.10 
At some point before mid-November 2015, Applicant paid the collection agent an 
unspecified sum that was deemed sufficient to satisfy the judgment.11 The account has 
been resolved. 
There are two alleged bank credit card accounts with the same creditor. SOR ¶ 
1.e. had a high credit of $3,610 and SOR ¶ 1.f. had a high credit of $5,759. Both accounts, 
with unspecified unpaid balances, were placed for collection, charged off, and sold to an 
unidentified debt purchaser in late 2009.12 In February 2010, a known debt purchaser 
obtained a judgment in the amount of $5,607.13 Although the original creditor was not 
identified in the credit reports, there is substantial circumstantial evidence to conclude 
that these two accounts were purchased by the debt purchaser which then obtained the 
judgment referred to in SOR ¶ 1.j. On May 3, 2016, Applicant sent letters to the creditor 
seeking validation of the accounts.14 There was apparently no response to the letters, as 
none was submitted to me by Applicant. Those accounts remain unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g. refers to a state lien in the amount $7,930 filed in November 2009 for 
underpayment of income taxes for the tax year 2005, following an audit in 2008.15 
Applicant eventually entered into an installment agreement with the state division of

taxation, and in 2008, 2012, and 2014, when he could do so, he made a number of 
periodic payments. By March 2015, he had reduced the outstanding balance, including 
penalty, interest, and installment fee, to $2,660.24.16 In 2015 and early 2016, Applicant 
focused on resolving other delinquent accounts and he interrupted his payments on the 
lien. During the hearing, he indicated that he was about to reestablish a formal repayment 
structure with the state to again address the lien.17 Although he failed to submit any 
documentation to support his renewed intention, it appears that, in light of his past actions 
and expressed intentions, the account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.l. refers to a medical account with an unpaid and past-due balance of 
$765 that was placed for collection.18 On October 20, 2015, Applicant paid the collection 
agent the entire amount.19 The account has been resolved.  
SOR ¶ 1.m. refers to a bank credit card account with a high limit of $3,724 that 
was placed for collection, charged off in an unspecified amount, and sold to a debt 
purchaser in about 2009.20 In 2011, the debt purchaser reported the unpaid balance as 
$6,577.21 While the account is listed with the original creditor in Applicant’s February 2015 
credit report, the account is not listed with the credit purchaser. On May 3, 2016, Applicant 
sent a letter to the collection agent seeking validation of the account.22 There was 
apparently no response to the letter, as none was submitted to me by Applicant. The 
account remains unresolved, although Applicant’s legal liability and responsibility for the 
account may have expired because of the statute of limitations. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.n. and 1.o. refer to Applicant’s federal income taxes for the tax year 
2012. SOR ¶ 1.n. alleged that Applicant failed to pay his federal income taxes in the 
approximate amount of $6,577, and that as of the date of the SOR (September 27, 2015), 
the tax debt remained unpaid. In fact, on December 1, 2014 – nearly ten months before 
the SOR was issued – Applicant paid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $1,000, and on 
December 31, 2014 – approximately nine months before the SOR was issued – he paid 
the IRS $6,259.13.23 The account has been resolved. SOR ¶ 1.o. alleged that Applicant 
failed to file his federal income tax return for that tax year “until no earlier than 2014.” 
Applicant acknowledged that his filing was late, but noted that he did eventually file the

federal income tax return in March 2014 – 18 months before the SOR was issued.24 The 
matter has been resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.p. and 1.q. refer to Applicant’s state income taxes for the tax year 2012. 
SOR ¶ 1.p. alleged that Applicant failed to pay his state income taxes in the approximate 
amount of $800, and that as of the date of the SOR (September 27, 2015), the tax debt 
remained unpaid. In fact, on October 14, 2014, Applicant entered into an Installment 
Agreement under which he agreed to make monthly payments. His payments 
commenced at that time and throughout 2014 and 2015, he routinely made them.25 On 
October 23, 2015, the department of revenue issued Applicant a notice of agreement 
satisfaction, indicating that the “receivables” had been “paid in full.”26 The account has 
been resolved. SOR ¶ 1.q. alleged that Applicant failed to file his state income tax return 
for that tax year “until no earlier than 2014.” Applicant acknowledged that his filing was 
late, but noted that he did eventually file the state income tax return in March 2014, before 
the SOR was issued.27 Although he indicated an intention to submit a copy of the filed 
return, he failed to do so. In the absence of such documentation, it is difficult to determine 
the true status of the tax return. Accordingly, it appears that the matter has not yet been 
resolved. 
Applicant currently earns about $150,000 a year. In May 2016, he submitted a 
Personal Financial Statement to reflect $10,284 as combined monthly net income for 
himself and his wife; $7,805 in monthly expenses; and $2,264 in various debt and other 
financial obligations; leaving $215 as a monthly remainder available for discretionary 
spending or savings.28 Applicant has engaged various creditors to make payments for 
various accounts that are not listed in the SOR, and he intends to follow up with those 
accounts listed that have not yet been resolved.29 He claimed to be somewhat concerned 
about those SOR-related accounts for which he requested validation because of the 
notice he had received from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management regarding the 
“malicious cyber intrusion” carried out against the U.S. Government. His personal 
information was included in the intrusion.30 In the absence of any additional unidentified 
delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's financial situation has improved dramatically 
and that his finances are finally under control.

Work Performance and Character References 
 A variety of friends, professional colleagues, his human resources manager, and 
a business partner are all enthusiastically supportive of Applicant’s application to obtain 
eligibility for a position of public trust. They describe him with such terms as trustworthy, 
honesty, integrity, professionalism, strength, character, reliable, and incredible role 
model.31 His annual employee performance reviews for 2013 and 2014 reflect individual 
ratings routinely “sometimes exceeds expectations.”32 Applicant has been vetted, and he 
was issued a state concealed weapons permit.33 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”34 As Commander in Chief, the President 
has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”35 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are 
such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security.”36 DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made.37  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

37 Regulation ¶ C8.2.1. It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense 
for Counterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, covers the 
handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations.

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”38 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.39 
  
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance 
determinations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on 
the side of denials.40 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that 
are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                          
38 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. In addition, the “failure to file annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same” may be 
disqualifying under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant’s initial financial problems apparently 
commenced in mid-2008, and continued partially interrupted until August 2012. 
Eventually, a number of accounts became delinquent, and they were placed for collection, 
charged off, or went to judgment. He failed to timely file some federal and state income 
tax returns. A tax lien was filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) have been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was 
so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated where “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control 
(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the 
evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.”41 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the basis of the 
dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. Much of what occurred was 
largely beyond Applicant’s control and took place under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur. Applicant was divorced in 2007, but a combination of circumstances 
                                                          
41 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

arose in mid-2008 that severely devastated Applicant’s finances. Commencing with the 
economic recession in 2008, he was largely unemployed, “self-employed,” or 
underemployed during various periods from May 2008 until August 2012. His annual 
salary plummeted from $60,000 to $70,000 essentially to zero. With insufficient money to 
pay his bills and keep his accounts current, a number of those accounts became 
delinquent. Applicant reduced his expenses by necessity, and he eventually moved into 
a backyard shack owned by his sister, where he resided, rent-free, for 18 months. His 
mother assisted him financially with other necessities. Although he was overwhelmed and 
unsure what to do to resolve his financial issues, he rejected bankruptcy, and he 
established a repayment plan. He started with his smaller debts and worked up to the 
larger ones. He finally obtained financial counseling.  
 
After securing his current position, and stabilizing his financial situation, Applicant 
started resolving his delinquent accounts. Approximately one year before the SOR was 
issued, Applicant entered into his first few repayment installment plans. Accounts were 
resolved or are in the process of being resolved, unpaid federal and state taxes were paid 
or are in the process of being paid, and late federal and state income tax returns were 
finally filed. Several accounts have not yet been resolved because the debt purchasers 
and collection agents failed to respond to Applicant’s requests for validation, and they are 
essentially disputed. Applicant currently earns about $150,000 per year. He has 
addressed all of his creditors, including some that were not identified or alleged in the 
SOR. A number of non-SOR accounts, as well as SOR accounts, have been resolved. 
There is documentation to support most of Applicant’s contentions. Several alleged debts 
are actually snapshots of the same accounts.  
 
Trustworthiness adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The adjudicative 
guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and every debt 
alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems 
and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an 
applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, 
nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be paid first. Rather a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one 
at a time.  
 
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of credit 
reports without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit bureaus 
collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and “other sources,” 
and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for concern. Likewise, when 
accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, an individual’s credit 
history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, the combined credit 
reports referred to numerous creditors for relatively few delinquent accounts. Because of 
abbreviated names and acronyms, multiple and partial account numbers for the same 
account listed several times under different creditors, debt purchasers, or collection 
agents, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial 
concerns. Likewise, when the information in the credit report is refuted by documentation 
from the actual creditor, and the credit reporting company, the creditor, collection agent, 
 
12 
                                      
 
or debt purchaser is furnished the correct information but still refuses or fails to correct its 
entries in a timely manner, or refuses to respond to requests for validation, one can 
conclude that the information in the credit report – actually a summary or secondary 
evidence pertaining to an account – is less accurate, trustworthy, or reliable than the other 
evidence of record. 
 
 Given Applicant’s appreciation for financial stability and his focused efforts on his 
remaining delinquent debts, and with a modest monthly remainder available for 
discretionary savings or spending, it appears that Applicant’s financial problems are finally 
under control. His actions no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.42   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain his various accounts in a current status, and many of his accounts were placed 
for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. He failed to timely file federal and state 
income tax returns for the tax year 2012, and he failed to pay all of his federal and state 
income taxes. A tax lien was filed. He apparently became overwhelmed by delinquent 
debt, and took little action to resolve his situation until 2014.  
 
The mitigating evidence is more substantial. There is no evidence of misuse of 
information technology systems, mishandling protected information, or substance abuse. 
Instead, there is an individual who is a loving, caring parent, friend, and employee who is

highly praised by those who know him. The national economic recession severely 
impacted him financially, and commencing in mid-2008, and continuing until August 2012, 
Applicant was unemployed, underemployed, or “self-employed” on several different 
lengthy occasions. His periods of unemployment, underemployment, and self-
employment combined to render his efforts to accumulate funds to resolve his debts 
ineffective. Nevertheless, Applicant developed a strategy to resolve his delinquent 
accounts. He dramatically reduced his expenses. As noted above, well before the SOR 
was issued, Applicant initiated his resolution efforts. Repayment installment plans were 
established. Since then, accounts were resolved or are in the process of being resolved, 
unpaid federal and state taxes were paid or are in the process of being paid, and late 
federal and state income tax returns were finally filed. Other than those accounts which 
are in the process of being resolved, the only unresolved accounts are those for which 
the debt purchasers and collection agents failed to respond to Applicant’s requests for 
validation, and they are essentially disputed. It should be noted that Applicant did not 
conceal his financial difficulties when completing his e-QIP. Instead, he was honest and 
forthright, and he reported them. The undisputed developed evidence enables me to 
conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are now under 
control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 43 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a somewhat delayed, but remarkably good record of 
accomplishment of debt reduction and elimination efforts, limited only by his former 
modest earnings as a result of a series of issues over which he had little control. 
Nevertheless, because Applicant is currently in the process of resolving his remaining

debts, this decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue his debt 
resolution efforts pertaining to those remaining accounts, or the actual accrual of new 
delinquent debts, will adversely affect his future eligibility for a position of public trust.44  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy a 
public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.

44 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a position of 
public trust to support a contract with DOD. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time 
through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a position of public trust now does not bar the 
Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security [or 
trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
[or trustworthiness] significance.” Nevertheless, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority 
to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, conditional, or probationary status, to an applicant’s eligibility for a 
position of public trust. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-
