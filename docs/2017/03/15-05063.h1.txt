FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-
QIP) on February 23, 2015. On March 18, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent 
him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The 
DOD acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. The guidelines are codified in 32 C.F.R. § 
154, Appendix H (2006), and they replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. 
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on April 18, 2016, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case 
on May 31, 2016. On June 1, 2016, a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
 
 2
(FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit 
material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. He received the 
FORM on June 13, 2016, and he submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX ) A through E, which 
were admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on February 24, 2017.  
 
The FORM included Item 3, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) 
conducted on March 26, 2015. The PSI was not authenticated as required by Directive ¶ 
E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the 
accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or 
object to consideration of the PSI on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant 
submitted a detailed response to the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy or 
completeness of the PSI summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived any 
objections to the PSI summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like 
lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights 
under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d 
and 1.g, with explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. His 
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by defense contractors 
since April 2004. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from November 1979 
until December 1999, when he retired. He held a security clearance while on active duty, 
and he received a clearance as a contractor employee in November 2004. 
 
 Applicant married in January 1963 and divorced in July 1994. He married again in 
February 1998 and divorced in July 2013. (Item 3 at 4.) He has lived with a cohabitant 
since August 2011. He has two adult children from his first marriage. He attended a 
university from February 2007 to January 2010, but he did not receive a degree. 
 
 When Applicant submitted his e-QIP, he disclosed that he had failed to timely file 
his federal income tax return for tax year 2010 and owed about $1,300 in taxes. He 
attributed his failure to file and pay the taxes due to “just stupidity.” (GX 1 at 32.) In the 
PSI, he admitted that he failed to file his returns or pay the taxes due in 2002 or 2003 and 
every tax year thereafter through 2010. (Item 3 at 5.) 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a federal tax lien for $41,108, which is reflected in 
Applicant’s March 2015 credit bureau report (CBR). In the PSI, Applicant told the 
investigator that the IRS garnished his pay in April 2013 and that he began making 
monthly $300 payments in July 2013. The record does not contain any documentation of 
these payments.  
 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
 3
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted evidence that he made monthly 
payments to the IRS from July 2014 to June 2015. He paid $297 in July 2014, $248 in 
August 2015, and $300 per month from September 2014 to June 2015. (AX A.) He stated 
that his payments will increase to $400 per month in June 2016. (AX E.) He submitted no 
documentation of payments after June 2015. 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a delinquent automobile loan that was charged off in 
September 2011 for $10,087, which was reflected in the March 2015 CBR. In Applicant’s 
response to the FORM, he submitted evidence that the debt was settled for less than the 
full amount in May 2015. (AX B.) 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.c alleges past-due payments on a time-share property totaling 
$3,932. In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted an IRS Form 1099-A, 
reflecting that the property was sold by the creditor for $11,349 in September 2015 and 
that the balance due before the sale was $6,957. (AX C.) This evidence indicates that the 
sale price was sufficient to satisfy the debt. 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of 
$1,302 in April 2011. In his response to the FORM, Applicant submitted evidence that the 
debt was paid in full in July 2016. 
 
 The SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f allege delinquent telephone bills for $449 and $174 placed 
for collection in September 2014 and October 2014. Applicant denied these debts in his 
answer to the SOR. In his response to the FORM, he stated that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f 
was for telephone service used by his ex-wife after he moved out of the marital home. He 
has not disputed the debts with the original creditor or the credit reporting bureau. The 
debts are not resolved. 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a medical bill for $166 placed for collection in a date not 
reflected in the March 2015 CBR. The CBR reflects that Applicant disputed the debt, it 
was resolved against him, and he disagreed with the decision. (Item 4 at 17.) The debt is 
not resolved. 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
 
 4
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and his March 2015 CBR establish three disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”), 
AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of 
the same”). The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially 
applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
 
 6
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant’s two marital breakups were 
circumstances beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly. He admitted that he 
had no valid excuse for not filing his tax returns, and his failure to file contributed to his 
current tax debt. He presented evidence of payments on the tax debt from July 2014 to 
June 2015, but no evidence of payments after June 2015. He did not resolve the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d until several years had elapsed after they became 
delinquent. The past-due payments on the time-share property alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c were 
resolved by an involuntary sale of the property, not by any voluntary action by Applicant. 
He has taken no meaningful action to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. He disputed 
the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, but provided no evidence of the basis for his dispute. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant produced no evidence of financial 
counseling, and his financial problems are not under control. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. This mitigating condition requires a showing of good 
faith, which means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts 
only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant receives some credit 
for the payments he has made on the federal tax debt, but they were prompted by the 
garnishment of his pay, and he has not submitted any evidence of payments after June 
2015. Allowing the time-share property in SOR ¶ 1.c to be foreclosed and sold does not 
constitute good faith. He did not resolve the delinquent automobile loan until he was 
confronted with the evidence by a security investigator during the PSI, and he realized 
that his security clearance was in jeopardy. Similarly, he did not resolve the credit-card 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.d until he received the SOR. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant disputed the medical bill in SOR 
¶ 1.g, the record does not reflect the basis for the dispute, and it was resolved against 
him.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 7
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant 
additional comment.  
 
Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I 
had no opportunity to evaluate his/her credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See 
ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). His failure to file tax returns 
suggests that he has difficulty complying with well-established governmental rules and 
systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting 
classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A security 
clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting debts or inducing an applicant to file 
tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment and 
reliability. Applicant’s repeated failures to fulfill his legal obligations to file tax returns and 
pay the taxes due indicate that he lacks the high degree of good judgment and reliability 
required of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-04159 
(App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and his failures to file 
tax returns and pay the taxes due. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden 
of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:    Against Applicant 
 
  
 
 8
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
