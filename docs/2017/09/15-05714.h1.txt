Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant received 31 suspensions, reprimands, or warnings from his employer 
from 2011 through 2015 for violating various rules. His July 18, 2014 electronic 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application 
(SCA) did not include the negative information about his employer’s disciplinary actions 
against Applicant; however, Applicant did not intentionally omit this information from his 
electronic SCA with intent to deceive. Personal conduct security concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.      
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On July 18, 2014, Applicant completed and signed his SCA. (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On March 15, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
 
2 
                                         
 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the personal conduct guideline. 
 
On March 28, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) 
Applicant requested a hearing. (Tr. 6) On August 11, 2016, Department Counsel was 
ready to proceed. On April 7, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On April 25, 2017, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the 
hearing for May 31, 2017. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered 
four exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 10-12, 51-52; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D) On June 8, 2017, DOHA 
received a hearing transcript. On September 21, 2017, Applicant provided a legible copy 
of Applicant’s DD Form 214, which was admitted without objection. (Tr. 71; AE C) 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to 
all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 
2006 AGs and are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. 
Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new 
AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.ii, and he denied the allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.jj. (HE 3) Applicant’s admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 54 years old, and he has been employed in security at a U.S. 
Government agency for 10 years. (Tr. 14) He is authorized to carry a firearm as part of 
his security duties. (Tr. 15, 26) He has held a security clearance since 2007, and a 
security clearance is required for his employment. (Tr. 15) He is a high school graduate, 
and he has not attended college. (Tr. 27) In 2005, he married, and in 2008, he divorced. 
(Tr. 49) He has a 17-year-old son. (Tr. 27) He served in the Army from 1982 to 1985, and 
in the Marine Corps from 1985 to 1989. (Tr. 49-50) He received honorable discharges. 
(Tr. 50) Applicant has assisted high-level government officials including senators and 
congressmen as part of his security duties. (Tr. 16)  
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.

Personal Conduct3 
 
Applicant received 17 suspensions from employment from 2011 to 2015 for 
violations of his employer’s disciplinary policy, non-medical call-off policy, or other 
policies: ¶ 1.a on January 13, 2011, for two days (GE 2 at 228); ¶ 1.f on November 25, 
2011, for two days (GE 2 at 196); ¶ 1.i on June 5, 2012, for two days (GE 2 at 77); ¶ 1.l 
on July 25, 2012, for five days (GE 2 at 65); ¶ 1.n on December 26, 2012, for two days 
(GE 2 at 28-29); ¶ 1.o on February 19, 2013, for one day (GE 2 at 191); ¶ 1.p on March 
26, 2013, for two days (GE 2 at 186); ¶ 1.q on May 13, 2013, for one day (GE 2 at 180); 
¶ 1.s on July 1, 2013, for one day (GE 2 at 173); ¶ 1.w on December 9, 2013, for one day 
(GE 2 at 141); ¶ 1.x on December 30, 2013, for one day (GE 2 at 156); ¶ 1.y on January 
3, 2014, for one day (GE 2 at 134); ¶ 1.z on February 28, 2014, for one day (GE 2 at 149); 
¶ 1.aa on March 27, 2014, for two days (GE 2 at 127); ¶ 1.ee on November 17, 2014, for 
two days (GE 2 at 118); ¶ 1.ff on January 20, 2015, for one day (GE 2 at 112); and ¶ 1.hh 
alleged on June 2, 2015, actually May 26, 2015, for one day (GE 2 at 104). Some of his 
suspensions were for multiple rule violations. 
 
Applicant’s employer issued 14 memoranda for record about violations of policy or 
letters of reprimand for violations of various rules: ¶ 1.b on March 10, 2011 (GE 2 at 222); 
¶ 1.c on April 20, 2011 (GE 2 at 216); ¶ 1.d on May 25, 2011 (GE 2 at 210); ¶ 1.e on June 
29, 2011 (GE 2 at 204); ¶ 1.g on April 4, 2012 (GE 2 at 40); ¶ 1.h on June 2, 2012 (GE 2 
at 102); ¶ 1.j on June 15, 2012 (GE 2 at 72); ¶ 1.m on December 12, 2012 (GE 2 at 55); 
¶ 1.u on September 4, 2013 (GE 2 at 167); ¶ 1.v on November 1, 2013 (GE 2 at 162);      
¶ 1.dd on August 27, 2014 (GE 2 at 123); ¶ 1.gg alleged on May 25, 2014, actually June 
2, 2014 (GE 2 at 102); and ¶ 1.ii on July 1, 2015 (GE 2 at 107).      
 
Applicant’s SOR indicates he received counseling on five occasions regarding 
violations of various rules: ¶ 1.k on July 22, 2012 (GE 2 at 64); ¶ 1.r on May 13, 2013 (GE 
2 at 179); ¶ 1.t on July 12, 2013 (GE 2 at 172); ¶ 1.bb on April 18, 2014 (GE 2 at 126); 
and ¶ 1.cc alleged on April 25, 2014, actually March 25, 2014 (GE 2 at 148) These 
counseling statements advise Applicant, for example, that he was late on an unspecified 
date, and he will receive a one or two day suspension, on an unspecified date. The 
counseling statements are duplications of the suspensions or other disciplinary actions 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Some of the reprimands and suspensions were issued for minor violations for 
clothing or equipment violations and also for chewing gum or having a breath mint in his 
mouth. (Tr. 17-20) Most violations were for failure to be on time for work, leaving his post 
without permission, or failing to call in when he went to a medical or other appointment. 
Some supervisors had “issues” with Applicant and tended to write him and others up for 
minor violations. (Tr. 17-18) For example, one supervisor wrote up Applicant for wearing 
his uniform home, even though Applicant had worn his uniform home on numerous 
occasions over the previous four years. (Tr. 18-19) Applicant said he was allowed to wear 
                                            
3 The SOR indicates all dates are approximate. Applicant was unsure about the dates of events. 
Applicant’s personnel documentation is extensive, and in the event of a conflict between the dates in the 
SOR or his personnel documentation, his personnel documentation is accepted as accurate. (GE 2) 
 
4 
                                         
 
his uniform home under agency regulatory standards. (Tr. 19) He did not provide copies 
of the regulations or policies that permitted him to wear his uniform when traveling home. 
Sometimes when he received an on-the-spot correction from a sergeant, he responded 
with inappropriate comments about the person making the correction. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2 at 
231) 
 
Mostly Applicant was suspended for being late for work or for not going to work. 
(Tr. 30-31) Once his employer may have suspended him for not responding to a security 
alarm. (Tr. 31-32) When a supervisor corrected him for not responding to the security 
alarm, he responded with obscenities and was told to leave the facility. (Tr. 32-33) He 
accused the sergeants of wanting to play “grab ass” with the attractive female security 
guard who was on duty. (Tr. 33, 58-59) He was unsure about whether he was cleared of 
failing to respond to the alarm because the three-to-seven day suspension listed several 
rules violations. (Tr. 60, 63)  
 
When he was reprimanded or suspended, his employer required him to sign an 
acknowledgement of receipt of the adverse documentation. (Tr. 20) He had the option of 
submitting a rebuttal to the adverse documentation; however, he often elected not to write 
a rebuttal because he could not remember the events from several days previously, and 
some offenses were so minor he elected not to respond to them. (Tr. 22) He never 
compromised security or classified information. (Tr. 22) He denied that some of the 
alleged violations were legitimate. (Tr. 35) He received notice of why he was suspended 
from duty. (Tr. 37-38)  
 
Applicant made a complaint against one sergeant for improperly changing 
Applicant’s schedule, and the sergeant was fired. (Tr. 22-23) Applicant noted there were 
not any adverse actions in evidence that were taken against him after July 2015. (Tr. 23) 
He believed the adverse actions stopped because some of the sergeants that generated 
adverse actions left employment with the contractor. (Tr. 23-26) The new sergeants have 
recognized Applicant for doing his job. (Tr. 24, 26) Applicant received the maximum score 
in weapons training. (Tr. 24) In January 2017, a U.S. government agency extended his 
guard credential to 2019 and his firearms credential to 2018. (Tr. 25)    
 
Applicant admitted that he received several adverse non-SOR personnel actions 
after January 2016. (Tr. 28) His employer did not suspend him from duty after January 
2016. (Tr. 28) He could not remember how many adverse actions he received after 
January 2016. (Tr. 29) None of the adverse actions taken against Applicant that were not 
listed in the SOR will be considered in this case. 
 
Falsification of July 18, 2014 SCA 
 
Applicant’s July 18, 2014 SCA asked in the last seven years have you received a 
written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in 
the workplace, such as violation of security policy. (SOR ¶ 1.jj; GE 1) Applicant answered, 
no, and did not provide any information about adverse actions taken against him by his 
employer. (SOR ¶ 1.jj; GE 1) 
 
 
5 
                                         
 
Applicant said he completed his SCA on paper, and then other employees typed 
the information into the computer. (Tr. 40, 61; GE 3) Applicant’s SCA was electronically 
produced on July 18, 2014. (GE 1) He signed the signature page for his SCA on August 
26, 2014, using pen and ink. (GE 1) He was unsure about whether he certified the SCA 
in July 2014. (Tr. 42-43) Prior to his hearing, he asked his employer for the paper copy of 
his SCA that he submitted; however, he did not receive it. (Tr. 45-47) He said he disclosed 
his suspensions from employment on the paper copy of the SCA he submitted. (Tr. 45-
46) He was “pretty sure” he put the correct information on his SCA, and he could not 
understand how the SCA at his hearing lacked accurate employment information. (Tr. 60) 
 
On December 15, 2017, Applicant volunteered to the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) investigator that his employer imposed suspensions against him for 
violations of rules on two occasions. (Tr. 51-54; GE 3) He did not discuss other 
reprimands or suspensions because the OPM investigator did not ask him about them. 
(Tr. 51-55) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided two letters from colleagues. (AE D) The general sense of their 
letters is that Applicant is professional, honest, helpful, enthusiastic, highly motivated, 
reliable, and trustworthy. (AE D)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
 
6 
                                         
 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
 
AG ¶ 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
7 
                                         
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations,       
. . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . . ;4 
   
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or 
omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, 
security official, competent medical or mental health professional involved 
in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility 
determination, or other official government representative; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information, 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual 
may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This 
includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or 
unreliable behavior . . . ; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate 
behavior; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and . . . .  
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a 
foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct 
includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing. . . . 
 
Applicant’s July 18, 2014 SCA asked in the last seven years have you received a 
written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in 
the workplace, such as violation of security policy. Applicant answered, no, and did not 
provide any information about adverse actions taken against him by his employer.  
 
Applicant said he completed his SCA on paper, and then other employees typed 
the information into the computer. His SCA was electronically produced on July 18, 2014. 
He signed the signature page on August 26, 2014, using pen and ink. He was unsure 
                                            
4 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden 
of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
about whether he certified the SCA in July 2014. He said he disclosed his suspensions 
from employment on the paper copy of the SCA he submitted. He was “pretty sure” he 
put the correct information on his SCA, and he could not understand how the SCA at his 
hearing lacked accurate employment information.  
 
On December 15, 2017, Applicant volunteered to the OPM investigator that his 
employer imposed suspensions against him from violations of rules on two occasions.  
See also AG ¶ 17(a) (“the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.”). He was 
open and honest with the investigator about his negative employment history.  Applicant 
is not sophisticated about forms and computer generated questionnaires. I am convinced 
that he did not intend to deceive security officials about his negative employment history. 
He refuted the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b), and SOR ¶ 1.jj is 
resolved for Applicant.  
 
Applicant received 17 suspensions from employment from 2011 to 2015 for 
violations of his employer’s disciplinary policy, non-medical call-off policy, or other 
policies.  He also received 14 memoranda for record about violations of policy or letters 
of reprimand for violations of various rules. AG ¶¶ 16(d) and 16(e) are established.  
 
AG ¶ 17 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, 
unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to 
recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability 
to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability.  
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for 
proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
 
9 
                                         
 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
AG ¶ 17(e) mitigates the concern raised in AG ¶ 16(e) because security officials 
and Applicant’s employer are well aware of his behavior problems. There is no possibility 
that information about his employment history could be used to coerce or manipulate him 
into violation of national security.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.r, 1.t, 1.bb, 
and ¶ 1.cc. These counseling statements advised Applicant, for example, that he was late 
on an unspecified date, and he will receive a one or two day suspension, on an 
unspecified date. The counseling statements are duplications of the suspensions or other 
disciplinary actions listed in the SOR. The fact that his employer counseled him not to 
continue to engage in certain behavior, and then he failed to adequately correct his 
behavior weighs against mitigating personal conduct concerns.  
 
None of the other mitigating conditions apply. Applicant was suspended from 
employment 17 times, and some of the suspensions were based on violations of multiple 
rules. Applicant cannot be trusted to conscientiously comply with security rules. Personal 
conduct security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline E are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guidelines but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant is 54 years old, and he has been employed in security at a U.S. 
Government agency for 10 years. He is authorized to carry a firearm as part of his security 
duties. He has held a security clearance since 2007, and there is no evidence of security 
violations. He served in the Army from 1982 to 1985, and in the Marine Corps from 1985 
to 1989. He received honorable discharges. As part of his security duties, Applicant has 
assisted high-level government officials including senators and congressmen. Two of 
Applicant’s colleagues indicated that Applicant is professional, honest, helpful, 
enthusiastic, highly motivated, reliable, and trustworthy.    
 
 The evidence against mitigation of security concerns is more substantial. 
Applicant’s employer issued 14 memoranda for record about violations of policy or letters 
of reprimand for violations of various rules. He also received 17 suspensions from 
employment from 2011 to 2015 for violations of his employer’s disciplinary policy, non-
medical call-off policy, or other policies. Some of his suspensions were for multiple rule 
violations. His failure to comply with his employer’s rules and policies demonstrates 
“questionable judgment . . .  or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [and 
raises unresolved] questions about an [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.” See AG ¶ 15. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal 
conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

Conclusion

interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
