Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided sufficient evidence of resolution of his financial issues. His SOR 
lists four delinquent debts. He paid three SOR debts, and he received a mortgage 
modification to bring the other SOR debt to current status. Financial considerations 
security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 11, 2016, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 2) On January 12, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.

On February 11, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On April 24, 2017, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 25, 2017, the case was assigned to 
me. On May 9, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing, setting the hearing for June 14, 2017. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits; Applicant offered 
six exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1-8; Applicant Exhibit (AE A-AE F)) On June 22, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. The record was held open initially until July 13, 
2017. (Tr. 55) Applicant received a 30-day extension. (HE 4) Applicant submitted 10 
documents on August 11, 2017, and his exhibits were admitted into evidence without 
objection. (AE G-AE P)  
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to 
all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 
2006 AGs and are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. 
Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new 
AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted that at one time he owed the creditors 
listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. 
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old technician mechanic who has been employed by a DOD 
contractor for the past eight years. (Tr. 6-8; GE 1) His only unemployment in the previous 
10 years was for 3 months in early 2009. (Tr. 8, 20; GE 1) In 1990, he graduated from 
high school, and in 1993, he received an associate’s degree in electronics. (Tr. 6-7) He 
has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has never married, and he does not have any 
children. (Tr. 7) There is no evidence of illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, or security 
violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
From 1993 to January 2009, the same employer employed Applicant, and his 
annual salary in January 2009 was $80,000. (Tr. 18, 20) He lost his employment and was 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.  
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
unemployed for three months. (Tr. 18) In March 2009, his current employer hired him at 
an annual salary of $50,000. (Tr. 18) In 2001, Applicant was diagnosed with cancer. (Tr. 
18, 20) From 2001 to 2013, he suffered from aspergillus, a debilitating disease of the 
immune system, which is a side effect from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
Aspergillus caused him to have reduced energy, lung inflammation, and coughing. (Tr. 
21-22) Sometimes he missed work due to his illness, which reduced his income. (GE 3; 
GE 4) After 2013, he was able to earn additional income through overtime once his 
aspergillus was under control. (Tr. 22) His relationship with his girlfriend ended; however, 
he did not explain how this affected his finances. (Tr. 18) His net monthly pay after taxes 
are deducted is about $3,700. (Tr. 40) He does not use a formal budget. (Tr. 42) He has 
about $58,000 in his 401(k) account. (Tr. 44) He is repaying a loan from his 401(k) 
account. (Tr. 44) He indicated he wanted to repay his 401(k) loan first, and then he wanted 
to borrow more funds from his 401(k) account to pay his debts.  
 
Applicant is making monthly payments of $110 on a tax debt of $5,411 for tax year 
2012 in accordance with an IRS payment plan. (Tr. 45; AE O) His taxes were delinquent 
for several years, and he has resolved his tax debt for all years except tax year 2012. (Tr. 
45) He paid off a federal tax lien filed in 2011. (Tr. 54-55; GE 2) He owes state taxes of 
about $200. (Tr. 46)3 There is no evidence he failed to timely file his tax returns. In 2012, 
Applicant’s security clearance was denied because of his finances. (Tr. 47) 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges four delinquent debts, and their status is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage past due in the amount of $17,564 with a total loan 
balance of $329,759. In 2005, Applicant financed the purchase of his residence. (Tr. 24) 
In 2009, his annual pay was reduced $30,000, and he fell behind on his mortgage 
payments. (Tr. 24-25) He received a loan modification from his mortgage company. (Tr. 
26) He was still having problems making his mortgage payments. He began his second 
loan modification process, and before it was complete, his mortgage company sold his 
loan to a different mortgage company (F). (Tr. 25) F told Applicant his monthly mortgage 
                                            
3 Applicant’s SOR does not include information about his delinquent state or federal taxes. In ISCR 
Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which 
conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The 
allegations of delinquent taxes will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. In this 
instance, his 2012 tax debt has limited relevance because he has a payment plan with the IRS. See AG ¶ 
20(g) (“the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount 
owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.”). If his tax debt was listed on his SOR as a security 
concern, I am confident he would have withdrawn sufficient funds from his 401(k) account to pay his tax 
debt.

payment was being increased from $2,000 to $2,600; however, Applicant advised F that 
the increased mortgage was unaffordable. (Tr. 27-28) He did not make his mortgage 
payments for about 15 months. (Tr. 44) He was able to save about $5,000 from not paying 
his mortgage. (Tr. 44) In January 2017, Applicant received the SOR and learned his home 
was in foreclosure status. (Tr. 27) He resumed the loan modification process with F. (Tr. 
25-26) On March 9, 2017, a state mortgage modification company (MMC) wrote Applicant 
and proposed a new monthly mortgage payment of $1,784 starting in August 2017, which 
is a reduction from his currently monthly payment of $1,804. (Tr. 29-30; AE C) The 
mortgage principal is $214,475; the deferred balance is $103,570; the interest rate is 
4.125%. (AE C) MMC made a payment of $36,558 to F to bring his mortgage current. (AE 
C) On March 15, 2017, Applicant signed a promissory note for $34,194 to bring his 
mortgage current. (AE D; AE L) If Applicant makes his payments for 10 years, 20 percent 
of the $34,194 original balance on the promissory note is forgiven, and after each 
additional five years is completed, an additional 20 percent of the $34,194 original 
balance on the promissory note is forgiven. (Tr. 30; AE L) Thus, if all payments are made 
for 30 years, the entire $34,194 will be forgiven. (AE L) Applicant is required to occupy 
his home to receive the loan forgiveness. (AE L) He said he made three mortgage 
payments after signing the promissory note. (Tr. 30-31) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off credit card debt owed to a credit union for 
$15,518. (Tr. 33) Applicant admitted he owed the debt, and he has been negotiating with 
the creditor to settle the debt. (Tr. 34-35) Applicant said the creditor offered to settle the 
debt for $3,000 to $5,000; however, he did not have the funds to settle the debt. (Tr. 34-
35) On July 25, 2017, Applicant settled the debt for $7,050. (AE H; AE I) On August 11, 
2017, the creditor wrote Applicant that the debt was settled, and no further collection 
activity will occur. (AE K)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $1,254. On 
February 3, 2017, the creditor wrote the debt owed is $1,254; however, the creditor is 
willing to negotiate a settlement for a substantially reduced amount. (AE F) Applicant said 
he returned the creditor’s equipment and stopped the service. (Tr. 35) He denied that he 
owed this debt. (Tr. 35) On August 8, 2017, Applicant paid the collection agent $627, and 
the collection agent wrote the debt has a zero balance. (AE J)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a bank debt placed for collection for $18,436. Around 2008 or 
2009, Applicant borrowed $7,800 to pay for home improvements. (Tr. 37) He paid the 
balance down to $5,000, and then stopped making payments in 2009. (Tr. 37-39) On April 
13, 2017, the collection company wrote Applicant offering to settle the debt for a one-time 
payment of $5,531. (Tr. 38-39; AE E) Applicant wrote a note with a confirmation number 
indicating the debt was settled. (AE N) On July 28, 2017, the collection agent wrote that 
that $5,531 was being electronically deducted from Applicant’s account. (AE P) 
 
In sum, Applicant’s April 24, 2017 credit report lists 16 accounts, including the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (GE 8) None of the other accounts on this credit report show 
a delinquent balance. Most accounts show “paid and closed” in the comments. (GE 8) 
Including his three mortgage payments, he paid about $20,000 to address his SOR debts 
in 2017. Three SOR debts are paid, and his other SOR debt is in a payment plan.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
 
6 
                                         
 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record. The record establishes the 
 
7 
                                         
 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about 
the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
  
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
  
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
  
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant’s finances were adversely affected by underemployment (reduction in 
his annual salary from $80,000 to $50,000), and cancer with its side-effect aspergillus. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges four delinquent debts. He paid three SOR debts, and his 
mortgage is in a current payment plan. There is no evidence of financial counseling. AG 
¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply.  
 
Based on Applicant’s track record of paying or resolving his debts, future new 
delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” His payments of his debts showed good 
faith. He has sufficient income to keep his debts in current status and to continue making 
progress paying his remaining debts. I am confident that Applicant will conscientiously 
endeavor to maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
 
9 
                                         
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old technician mechanic who has been employed by a DOD 
contractor for the past eight years. In 1993, he received an associate’s degree in 
electronics. In 2009, his finances were harmed when he changed employment, and his 
annual salary was reduced from $80,000 to $50,000. He suffered from cancer and 
aspergillus, which resulted in a reduction in his ability to work and less income. There is 
no evidence of illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, or security violations. 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges four delinquent debts. He paid three SOR debts, and he 
received a mortgage modification for the other SOR debt. All of his debts, including his 
federal and state income tax debts are in current payment plans. His April 24, 2017 credit 
report has 2 negative entries for SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and the other 14 entries have a 
zero delinquent balance. Most credit report entries indicate “paid and closed.” The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). He understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain 
his financial responsibility. He took reasonable actions under his particular financial 
circumstances to address his delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment, and I am confident he will maintain his financial 
responsibility.6

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility.

Applicant’s finances. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance 
of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not have “authority 
to grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 
17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-
03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional 
or probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to grant Applicant’s security 
clearance is conditional.
