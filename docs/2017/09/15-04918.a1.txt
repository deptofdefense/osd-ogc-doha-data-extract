APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
April 29, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B
(Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)
(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 26, 2017, after
considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge
Francisco Mendez denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant
to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge’s findings of fact
contained errors and whether the Judge’s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.  Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline B allegation in the File of Relevant Material. 
Therefore, that Guideline is not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
Applicant retired from the military in 2006 after 20 years of service.  After leaving the
military he has worked as a Federal contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since early
2016.  While in the military, Applicant’s first attempt to obtain a clearance was unsuccessful due
to pre-service misconduct.  He was granted a clearance in 1990 or 1991.  A few years later, the
military investigated Applicant for misconduct during an overseas tour of duty.  Applicant was never
charged with wrongdoing.
Applicant built a house in 2005, financing the construction with equity taken from his
existing home.  After it was built, Applicant accepted work overseas and rented out his new house. 
In 2009, Applicant’s renter had to vacate, and Applicant was not able to find another tenant.  He
could not pay the mortgages on two houses and sought a loan modification, but the lender denied
this request.  The lender foreclosed on the new house in 2010 and provided Applicant with a Form
1099-C showing that the over-$500,000 debt had been canceled.  Despite his stated inability to pay
his mortgages, Applicant took numerous vacations in Europe and Asia between 2008 and 2013.
In 2007 and 2008, Applicant earned $118,000 and $300,000 respectively.  In 2010 he earned
$140,000, in 2011 $115,000, and in 2012 through 2014 $200,000 or more each year.  Applicant
completed his security clearance application (SCA) in 2014.  In that document he disclosed $50,000
of past-due debt, although he did not report the foreclosure on his house.  In his subsequent
interview, he attributed his financial problems to the recession, reduction in pay, reliance on credit
cards, and costs of his wife’s visits to a foreign country to care for her ailing mother.  He told the
interviewer that he was paying down debts.  
In 2015, after creditors initiated lawsuits against him, Applicant filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy protection.  His debts included delinquent state and Federal taxes, unsecured debts of
over $190,000, and monthly income of nearly $11,000.  After expenses, which included $3,000 a
month for the care and feeding of a horse and for his daughter’s riding lessons, Applicant had a
negative remainder of $450.  
The Judge’s Analysis
The Judge noted Applicant’s claim that his problems resulted from insufficient income. 
However, he cited to evidence that, during the years in question, Applicant received significant
compensation, his adjusted gross income from 2010 to 2014 totaling almost $1,000,000.  The Judge
also noted that Applicant’s bankruptcy petition included reference to an unpaid $30,000 judgment
dating from 2007.  The Judge concluded that Applicant’s purchase of luxury cars, his expensive
vacations, and his daughter’s riding lessons  showed that he was living beyond his means.  He stated
that Applicant had filed for bankruptcy only after his creditors sued him.
In the whole-person analysis, the Judge acknowledged Applicant’s military service and his
support to the U.S. as a contractor.  He found that this favorable evidence was not sufficient to
outweigh the concerns arising from Applicant’s financial difficulties.  He also noted that Applicant
had disclosed only $50,000 of debt in his SCA despite having about four times that much, as
reflected in his bankruptcy filings.  The Judge found that this detracted from Applicant’s credibility.
Discussion
Applicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  He argues that the Judge
did not present the military investigation in its proper context, that his total earnings included
benefits paid by his employer and did not reflect his true economic circumstances,1 that his vacations
had been paid for by his employer rather than out of his own pocket, that the $30,000 judgment was
against his wife rather than himself, etc.  In presenting his arguments on appeal, Applicant includes
matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  
We have considered Applicant’s arguments in light of the evidence as a whole.  Concerning
the judgment, the Judge found that it was one of Applicant’s unpaid debts.  However, the bankruptcy
filings state that it was a judgment against his wife.  Despite this, we find no reason to conclude that
the Judge would have rendered a different decision if he had explicitly found that the judgment was
against Applicant’s wife, insofar as it was included in their joint petition for bankruptcy. 
Applicant’s arguments do not undermine the Judge’s conclusion that his financial problems were
generally the result of his own conduct and that Applicant had the financial means to address his
problems before resorting to bankruptcy.  The Judge’s material findings of security concern are
based upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable interpretations of the evidence.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 15-01285 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 22, 2016). 
The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  An applicant who fails to discharge his or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when
due, may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified
information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case 14-06808 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016);  See also Cafeteria and
Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367
U.S. 886 (1961).  The Judge’s findings that Applicant had failed to disclose the true extent of his
financial problems support his adverse credibility determination.  We give deference to a Judge’s
credibility determinations.  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.  Moreover, the Judge’s findings about Applicant’s
income and the relationship of his spending choices to his financial delinquencies, and about the
timing of his effort at tackling his delinquent debts, constitute a reasonable interpretation of the
record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01243 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 18, 2015).  
The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may be
granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department of
the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access national security eligibility will be resolved in
1Applicant’s assertions on this point were contained in his Response to the File of Relevant Material.  He
provided no evidence to corroborate his claim.  It is Applicant’s burden to produce evidence in mitigation.  Directive
¶ E3.1.15.  
favor of the national security.”
