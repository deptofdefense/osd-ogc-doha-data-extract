Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG).1 
 
                                                          
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

Applicant responded to the SOR on December 1, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 
18, scheduling the hearing for September 6, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. 
  
The Government’s discovery letter and exhibit list were appended to the record 
as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1 and 2. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted 
in evidence without objection. Applicant’s exhibit lists were appended to the record as 
HEs A and B. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through G, 
which were admitted in evidence without objection.  
 
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until September 27, 2017, for the parties to submit additional 
documentation. Applicant timely provided additional evidence, which I marked as AEs H 
through L and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is 27 years old. She obtained 
her high-school diploma in 2008 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2017. She worked for 
previous defense contractors from 2015 until she obtained her current job with a 
defense contractor in January 2016. She was granted a DOD security clearance in 
November 2015. She is married and she has three minor children.2 
 
 The SOR alleges 13 delinquent consumer debts for $17,173 and two delinquent 
medical debts for $2,783. The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s 
admissions and the credit reports.3  
 
 Applicant attributes her delinquent debts to the periods in which she and her 
husband were either unemployed or earning minimal income. Her spouse was 
unemployed off and on for a total of two to three years from 2011 until he obtained his 
current job in June 2017; he only received unemployment benefits between 2011 and 
2012. He worked at a pizzeria and earned minimal income between 2014 and 2017. 
Applicant was a stay-at-home mother for six months to one year prior to obtaining her 
current job; she did not receive unemployment benefits. Between 2011 and June 2015, 
she earned minimal income with the jobs she held at a rehabilitation center, a doctor’s 
office, and an elementary school. In 2009, Applicant incurred unexpected medical 
expenses after she suffered a kidney failure. Applicant stated that she made poor 
financial decisions in the past by not timely paying her debts because she lacked the 
income to do so.4

 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.o are for a credit union overdraft fee and credit card, 
respectively, for which Applicant became delinquent in 2009. Applicant testified that the 
credit union would not permit her to pay the $38 overdraft fee before she paid the $898 
delinquent credit card. She received correspondence from an attorney for the credit 
card company several years ago, and she was in contact with him to resolve it. She 
made a $300 payment by money order in April 2017, but the attorney would not provide 
her with a statement reflecting her payment until she paid the credit card in full. She 
intended to continue to resolve both debts. She provided a copy of her March 2017 
credit report reflecting that the overdraft fee carried a zero balance, and the credit card 
balance was $598.5  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is for a car Applicant purchased in 2012 for $14,000. The car was 
totaled when Applicant’s spouse got into a car accident. Prior to the accident, Applicant 
was current on her car and insurance payments. After the accident, the insurance 
company refused to pay the balance on the car because the car company refused to 
give it a signed title. Meanwhile, her car was towed and junked, and the towing 
company would not release the car or tags to her unless she paid $1,700, which she 
could not afford. Applicant spoke with the creditor two weeks prior to the hearing, and 
she was in the process of negotiating a settlement. While the creditor indicated that it 
was willing to settle the debt for as low as 25% of the outstanding balance, Applicant 
would be required to pay the settlement amount within 30 days. Applicant intended to 
set aside $300 monthly to settle this debt, and she saved $350 as of the hearing.6 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c is a store credit card for which Applicant became delinquent in 2015. 
She testified that she paid it in 2016. She provided a September 2017 letter from the 
collection agency for the store credit card reflecting that Applicant’s account carried a 
zero balance.7  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d is for a car Applicant currently owns. She purchased it for $18,000, 
and she became delinquent in 2016. As of the hearing date, she was 30 days 
delinquent. She telephoned the creditor and set up a four-month payment plan that 
would have brought the account current by the end of October 2017. Since her spouse 
is working, she anticipated being able to continue to make timely payments on this 
account. Her March 2017 credit report reflects that this account is current.8  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e is for a cable service account for which Applicant believed she 
became delinquent in 2013. She paid $25 monthly beginning in mid-2017, and she 
made a final payment of $191 in August 2017 to resolve this debt. She provided an

August 2017 letter from the collection agency for the cable company reflecting that the 
account was settled in full.9  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f is for a telephone account. Applicant provided documentation to show 
that she paid this debt in February 2017.10  
   
 SOR ¶ 1.g is for another telephone account. Applicant provided documentation to 
show that she settled and paid this debt in November 2016.11 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h is for another cable service account. Applicant paid this debt in 
August 2017. She provided a September 2017 receipt from the collection agency for the 
cable company reflecting that she paid $358 in August 2017, and the account was 
settled in full.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i is for a gas and electric account for which Applicant became 
delinquent in 2010. Applicant testified that she gave her father, who was listed as a 
secondary account holder, money to pay this debt in March 2017. She provided a 
September 2015 account history reflecting that she made two payments totaling $971 in 
April 2017, and an August 2017 letter from the creditor reflecting that this account 
carried a zero balance.13 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j is for a credit card. As of the hearing date, Applicant had recently 
attempted to contact the collection agency to settle the debt. She intended to pay $50 
monthly to resolve it.14 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k is for a medical debt. Applicant was unable to locate the creditor as it 
was no longer reported on her recent credit reports. She will continue to try to locate the 
creditor to resolve this debt.15 
   
 SOR ¶ 1.l is for a cable account Applicant opened in 2012, at the request of one 
of her sisters when they lived together, on the condition that the sister paid the account. 
When the sister moved to another state, Applicant was unable to pay the account. She 
provided documentation to show that she disputed this debt in August 2017. She 
acknowledged that if her dispute is unsuccessful, she will have to pay the account.

Applicant learned her lesson from this experience and she has not since cosigned for 
anyone.16  
  
 SOR ¶ 1.m is for Applicant’s cable account. Applicant testified that she set up a 
payment plan of $50 monthly for 12 months, and she provided documentation to show 
that she made one payment of $50 in September 2017. She intended to continue 
making these payments until this debt is resolved.17 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.n is for a medical debt Applicant incurred in 2009. Applicant disputed 
this debt because she believed it should have been covered by state medical 
assistance she received off and on between 2008 and 2014. She testified that she was 
in the process of trying to verify whether she had state medical assistance at the time; if 
so, she intended to provide such proof to the creditor; if not, she intended to pay this 
debt.18 
 
Applicant does not have any other delinquent debts. She has not received 
financial counseling, but she testified that a friend with accounting experience was 
assisting her with managing her finances. She developed a budget to keep track of her 
income and expenses. As of the hearing date, her monthly household net income was 
$5,400; after expenses, her monthly household net remainder was $400, which she 
intended to use to continue to resolve her debts. She made plans to reduce her 
household expenses, including an impending move to another rental.19 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
 
7 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Since Applicant’s financial problems started in 2009, Applicant has made a 
good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. She resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c to 
1.i; she is in the process of paying SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.o; and she intends to resolve the 
remaining SOR debts. 
 
  A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she 
need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant has not incurred additional delinquent debts. While Applicant has unresolved 
SOR debts, she has demonstrated a good-faith effort and has the means to continue to 
resolve her remaining debts. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are applicable.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
8 
 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant has unresolved SOR 
debts, Applicant credibly testified at hearing and there is sufficient evidence to show that 
she is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
