Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 9, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Applicant responded to the SOR on September 19, 2016, and elected to 
have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 26, 2016, 
Department Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2017. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 23, 2017, 
scheduling the hearing for September 14, 2017. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and A(1) through 
A(3), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) 
on September 22, 2017.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 68 years old. He has worked for his current employer since 1989. He 
seeks to retain a security clearance. He has two master’s degrees and a PhD, which 
were awarded in 1974 and 1975. He has never married, but he lived with a cohabitant 
for more than 20 years. He has no children.1 
 
Applicant’s assets include his home and an investment property. The properties 
are valued at about $400,000 each, and neither property is encumbered by a mortgage. 
He has about $1.2 million in a retirement account. However, Applicant also has a history 
of not filing his state and federal income tax returns on time and not paying his taxes 
when due.2 
 
Applicant did not file his state and federal tax returns for 2002 through 2008 
when they were due. His state garnished his wages in 2003 for unpaid state taxes. 
Applicant noted the garnishment on his 2005 security clearance application. He did not 
pay all the taxes due when he filed the back returns in 2010. The IRS filed a $37,179 
tax lien against him in 2011.3 
 
Applicant did not file his state and federal tax returns for 2010 through 2014 
when they were due. He also did not pay the total amount of taxes owed. He wrote in 
his May 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he was 
“working to organize [his] records and expect to have this matter resolved by June 
2015.” When he was interviewed for his background investigation in January 2016, he 
stated that he was in the process of selling his investment home and retaining a tax 
accountant to work with the IRS to reach a settlement. He stated that he would use the 
profit from the sale of the home to pay his back taxes.4 
 
Applicant filed his past-due state and federal tax returns after he received the 
SOR. He wrote in his September 2016 response to the SOR that he was “working with 
the IRS to sell the property which the lien is upon which in order to settle all federal and 
state tax debts.” Applicant did not pay his state and federal taxes until days before the 
hearing.5 His payments are addressed in the below table:

2 Tr. at 23-24; GE 3; AE A.  
 
3 Tr. at 23, 27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A. The SOR did not allege the state garnishment 
or Applicant’s failure to file tax returns from 2012 to 2008. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will 
not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant’s overall 
financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis.

Applicant sold his primary residence in 2011 for $410,000, realizing a profit after 
accounting for the original purchase price of $238,000 and $26,000 in sales expenses. 
Since his profit was less than $250,000, he did not owe taxes on the profit. Because he 
had not filed an income tax return, the IRS did not know the cost basis of the original 
purchase price. In 2015, the IRS assessed $161,862 in additional taxes for tax year 
2011.7 
 
Applicant filed his tax returns himself. He thought he did not have to report the 
2011 sale because the profit was less than $250,000. Applicant provided information 
about the sale at the IRS’s request. The IRS reduced or removed additional 
assessments of $232,478 in June 2017. The IRS is apparently satisfied that he paid his 
taxes for tax year 2011. The state is waiting for confirmation from the IRS.8 
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017.

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
  Applicant did not file his tax returns when they were due, and he did not pay his 
taxes in spite of his ability to do so. The evidence established the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
I am satisfied that Applicant does not owe the large amount alleged for tax year 
2011. SOR ¶ 1.d is concluded for Applicant. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control;  
 
6 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant’s tax issues go back at least 15 years. His wages were garnished by 
his state in 2003. He did not file his state and federal tax returns for 2002 through 2008 
when they were due. He did not pay all the taxes due when he filed the back returns in 
2010, resulting in a $37,179 federal tax lien filed against him in 2011. He returned to his 
old habits and did not file his tax returns for 2010 through 2014 until after he received 
the SOR. He did not pay his state and federal taxes, including federal taxes for tax 
years 2005 through 2007, until days before the hearing. The Appeal Board has held that 
“it is proper for a Judge to consider that an applicant, aware of his debts, has 
undertaken to address them only after having been advised that his clearance is in 
jeopardy.” See ISCR Case No. 11-13949 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 5, 2013).  
 
 Applicant’s repeated failure to fulfil his tax obligations suggests that he does not 
possess the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted 
access to classified information and that he has a problem with complying with well-
established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-04437 
at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). This is true even though the returns have been filed. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016).  
 
  Applicant’s tax issues are recent. They continue to cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I have no confidence that he will comply 
with the tax laws in the future. AG ¶ 20(a) is not applicable. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are 
partially applicable, and AG ¶ 20(g) is applicable, but they do not completely mitigate 
the judgment issues raised by Applicant’s many years of shirking his responsibility to file 
his tax returns and pay his taxes. I find that financial considerations concerns remain 
despite the presence of some mitigation.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
7 
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant’s tax issues are resolved. 
However, he was a tax scofflaw for many years. He did not file his tax returns until after 
he received the SOR, and he did not pay his taxes until days before the hearing. I have 
no confidence that future tax returns and taxes will be filed and paid on time.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
