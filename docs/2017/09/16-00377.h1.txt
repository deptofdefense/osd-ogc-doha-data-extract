FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 31, 2015. 
On July 27, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 
2006.2

clearance application and subsequent documents regarding her application. Some of the documents in the 
case file identify her by the last name of her ex-husband.

adjudicative guidelines. The SEAD 4 guidelines apply to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June

 Applicant answered the SOR on August 18, 2016, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case 
on November 2, 2016. On November 3, 2016, a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. She 
received the FORM on November 9, 2016, and submitted a response, which was included 
in the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on September 7, 2017. 
 
The FORM includes an unauthenticated summary of a personal subject interview 
(PSI) conducted on September 29, 2015 (Item 3). The PSI was not authenticated as 
required by Directive ¶ E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that she was 
entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, 
additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI on the ground that it 
was not authenticated. Applicant submitted a detailed response to the FORM but did not 
comment on the accuracy or completeness of the PSI summary, nor did she object to it. 
I conclude that she waived any objection to the PSI summary. Although pro se applicants 
are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable 
steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Jul. 12, 2016).  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the facts alleged in the SOR. I have incorporated her 
admissions in my findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is a 40-year-old senior clinician employed by federal contractors since 
April 2014. She served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1995 to November 
1999 and received an honorable discharge. She has never held a security clearance. 
 
 Applicant was the director of social services in a rehabilitation and nursing home 
from June to November 2004 and a case manager in a community action program from 
November 2005 to September 2008. She worked as a part-time intern in a Veterans 
Administration hospital from September 2008 to February 2009. She worked in a clinic 
providing psychological and psychiatric services from February to May 2009, but was 
terminated for incorrectly submitting billing time reports. She worked in a family services 
clinic from June 2009 to March 2010 but was fired after a urinalysis that tested positive 
for marijuana. She was employed by a counseling clinic from April 2010 to June 2010, 
when the clinic closed. She worked for another clinic from July to October 2010 but left 
because of the long commute and inadequate caseload. She worked as an outpatient 
therapist for a government contractor providing counseling and consulting services from 
October 2010 to July 2012, when her contract ended. She worked as a hospital transition 
team supervisor from August 2012 to January 2014, when she was terminated for 
tardiness. She was unemployed from February 2014 to April 2014. She filed an equal-
                                                          
8, 2017. My decision is based on the guidelines in SEAD 4, referred to in this decision as “AG.” The changes 
resulting from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

opportunity complaint against her employer, based on race and gender discrimination, 
and she was compensated for wrongful termination.3 She worked as a care coordinator 
for a federal contractor from April to October 2014, and left this job by mutual agreement 
following notice of unsatisfactory performance in October 2014. She was hired by her 
current employer in November 2014.  
 
Applicant married in May 2003 and divorced in June 2008. She has a two-year-old 
daughter. She received a bachelor’s degree in May 2005 and a master’s degree in May 
2009.  
 
 When Applicant submitted her SCA, she disclosed that she had not filed her 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012. She stated that she did not file 
her returns because “it was overwhelming and [she] kept poor records of expenses.” (Item 
2 at 41.) In her answer to the SOR, she also admitted that she did not timely file her 
federal income tax return for 2013. 
 
 In July 2016, Applicant filed her federal return for 2011, entered into a payment 
agreement for that tax year, and made all the required payments. She timely filed her 
2014 return. (Enclosures to SOR Answer.) She filed her 2012 and 2013 returns in August 
2016. She has paid all past-due taxes. (Response to FORM.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible 
rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative 
judge applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
                                                          
3 I am satisfied that Applicant’s termination for tardiness in February 2014 was unjustified, and I have not 
considered it for any adverse purpose.

classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.” ISCR Case 
No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, as required. The SOR alleges the same conduct twice 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . 
 
 
 5
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal income tax returns establishes two 
disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”) and 
AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required”). The 
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are identical. When the same conduct is alleged twice 
in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be 
resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 
3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR ¶ 1.b for Applicant. 
 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) are not established. Applicant’s failures to timely file her tax 
returns were recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making them 
unlikely to recur or because of conditions largely beyond her control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is established. However, Applicant’s eventual compliance with her tax 
obligations does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-
enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed her past-due returns “does not preclude 
careful consideration of Applicant’s security worthiness based on longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). 
Furthermore, the establishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable 
security-clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014).

In this case, Applicant’s delinquent tax returns closely followed other irresponsible 
behavior, including being fired for use of marijuana in March 2010.4 She failed to timely 
file her returns for three consecutive tax years. She did not begin to rectify her tax situation 
until she filed her 2011 return in July 2016, after submitting her security clearance 
application and realizing that her past-due returns and tax debt raised security concerns. 
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate 
the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. 
Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961) 
 
Whole-Person Analysis 
 
 The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, an 
administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by 
considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An 
administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(c).5  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(c). Applicant is a well-educated woman. 
She served honorably in the U.S. Army. Because she requested a determination on the 
record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility and sincerity 
based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based 
on the evidence in the record, including the evidence submitted by Applicant, I conclude 
that she has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her failure to timely file her 
federal income tax returns.  
 
  
                                                          
4 Applicant’s marijuana use was not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for denying 
her application for a security clearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to 
assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to 
evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered her admitted marijuana use for these limited purposes.  
 
5 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.b:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
