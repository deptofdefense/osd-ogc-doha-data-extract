Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided sufficient evidence of resolution of his financial issues. He paid 
two of the debts on his statement of reasons (SOR), and the other three SOR debts are 
in payment plans. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On August 5, 2015, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On September 12, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.

On October 7, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On March 7, 2017, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 24, 2017, the case was assigned to 
me. On May 8, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing, setting the hearing for June 13, 2017. (Tr. 13-14; HE 1) Applicant’s hearing 
was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered 
seven exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 15-18; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE G) On June 21, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. On July 13, 2017, Applicant provided seven 
exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE H-AE N) On August 21, 2017, the 
record closed. 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to 
all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 
2006 AGs and are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. 
Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new 
AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 
1.e. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been employed as an information technology 
operations manager since November 2011. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) He has not had any periods 
of unemployment in the past 10 years. (Tr. 9) He has held a security clearance since 
1996. (Tr. 23) In 1983, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He served in the Marine 
Corps from 1983 to 1997, and he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant. (Tr. 7-8, 
18) His specialty was signals intelligence operator and Spanish linguist. (Tr. 8) In 1990, 
he received a bachelor’s degree, and in 2004, he received a master’s degree in computer 
information systems. (Tr. 8) In 1986, he married. (Tr. 7) His son was born in 1989, and 
he is a Marine deployed overseas. (GE1; GE 2)  
 
Applicant worked in Iraq from November 2007 through November 2008 and from 
June 2010 to August 2011, and in Afghanistan from May 2009 to December 2009 on 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.

behalf of a government contractor. (Tr. 9, 20-21; AE B) Applicant was subjected to enemy 
fire on several occasions. (Tr. 21)  
  
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists the following allegations, and their status is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a state C tax lien was entered against Applicant in January 2012 
for $22,626. Before Applicant deployed to Iraq in 2007, he lived in state F, and his state 
of residence for tax purposes was F. (Tr. 22) While he was in Iraq, his spouse moved to 
state C, and his home in state F was rented. (Tr. 22) From November 2008 to May 2009, 
he lived in state C before being deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. (AE B) Applicant 
received bad tax advice that he could continue to claim residency in state F while he was 
in Iraq. (Tr. 24) In 2011, Applicant discovered under state C tax law he had been a state 
C resident since 2009. (Tr. 22) Applicant amended his state C tax returns for 2009 and 
2010, and calculated that he owed almost $23,000 to state C. (Tr. 22-23) In 2012, he 
began a $400 monthly payment plan to resolve the debt. (Tr. 23) His annual state and 
federal income tax refunds were applied to this debt. (Tr. 23) On June 12, 2017, state C 
wrote Applicant and said the following debts including penalties and interest were paid: 
2009 for $14,020; 2010 for $11,653; and 2011 for $16,949. (AE C) His state C tax debt is 
paid. (Tr. 23, 34; AE C)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt on a credit card for $14,495. 
Applicant’s spouse used the credit card for her business. (Tr. 24) Applicant said that the 
creditor agreed to charge off the debt, and Applicant would not seek business with the 
creditor in the future. (Tr. 25-26) Applicant was unsure of the status of the debt because 
his credit report showed a zero balance, and he has not received any communications 
from the creditor or collection agents. (Tr. 25-27) The last payment was made in July 
2011, and the account was charged off in August 2013. (AE G at 2) In July 2017, Applicant 
made a $50 payment to the creditor, and in August 2017, he made a $75 payment to the 
creditor. (AE I; AE K; AE L) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant has a medical debt placed for collection for $323. 
Applicant was unaware of the debt until he received the SOR. (Tr. 28) Once he became 
aware of the debt, he began paying it off, and it was paid in January 2017. (Tr. 28, 34; AE 
F)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a charged-off debt of unspecified amount. His credit report 
shows a $10,707 debt was charged off, and then referred for collection in 2013. (Tr. 29; 
GE 4 at 12) On August 14, 2017, the original creditor responded to Applicant’s request 
for information and said the creditor was advising the credit reporting companies to 
remove the debt from his credit reports. (AE H) A collection agent contacted Applicant 
seeking $11,979, and on August 11, 2017, Applicant paid the creditor $25. (AE M)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a student loan placed for collection for $23,645. Applicant was 
using his debit card to make automatic payments on his student loans; however, there 
was a fraud alert, and his card was terminated. (Tr. 31-32) He failed to renew the 
 
4 
                                         
 
automatic payments when his debit card was reissued. (Tr. 31) His student loan was 
transferred to a different creditor. (Tr. 32) He did not open the notices from the new 
creditor because he thought they were confirmations of payments. (Tr. 33) In January 
2016, he began the process of consolidating his student loans, and in November 2016, 
he began a payment plan with the creditor. (Tr. 31; AE E at 2-3) On June 8, 2017, the 
creditor wrote a $125 payment was received on May 28, 2017, and a $125 payment was 
received on June 28, 2017. (AE D) The current balance owed is $21,672. (AE D) The 
past-due amount is zero. (AE D) His spouse handled the family finances, and he was 
unaware payments were not being made. (Tr. 33) 
 
Applicant’s March 2, 2017 credit report, the most recent credit report of record, lists 
23 accounts, including the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. (GE 5) All accounts, except 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, show a zero balance. Except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 
1.e, the comments indicate the debts were paid, pays as agreed, or transferred. (GE 5)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
5 
                                         
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
 
6 
                                         
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations;” and “(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions. 
 
Six financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;4   
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
4 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
 
7 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for 
proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
 Applicant provided important mitigating information. He was deployed to combat 
zones in Iraq and Afghanistan for 33 months. His spouse handled his finances. He 
received bad advice about state of residence for state income tax. These are 
circumstances partially or fully beyond his control that harmed his finances.   
 
Applicant paid his state tax debt and his medical debt. Two credit card debts and 
one student loan debt are in payment plans. There is no evidence of financial counseling. 
AG ¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) apply. Based on Applicant’s track record of paying or 
resolving his debts, future new delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on [Applicant’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there 
are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” His payments 
of his debts showed good faith. He has sufficient income to keep his debts in current 
status and to continue making progress paying his remaining debts. I am confident that 
                                            
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts 
are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been employed as an information technology 
operations manager since November 2011. He served in the Marine Corps from 1983 to 
1997, and he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant. In 1990, he received a 
bachelor’s degree, and in 2004, he received a master’s degree in computer information 
systems. In 1986, he married, and his son was born in 1989.  
 
Applicant worked in Iraq or Afghanistan for 33 months from November 2007 to 
August 2011. He was subjected to enemy fire on several occasions. He served in a U.S. 
designated combat zone, and he made contributions to the U.S. military at personal risk. 
These circumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and 
report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or 
exploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past 
honorable service in combat zones weigh towards approval of his security clearance. See 
ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (noting as mitigation that “. . . 
Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect American lives and 
interests in Afghanistan.”). 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges five delinquent debts. He paid two SOR debts, and he 
began making payments to address the other three SOR debts. His March 2, 2017 credit 
report lists 23 accounts. All accounts, except the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, show a zero balance. 
Except for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, the comments indicate the status of the 
debts is paid, pays as agreed, or transferred.   
 
9 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). He understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain 
his financial responsibility. He took reasonable actions under his particular financial 
circumstances to address his delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment, and I am confident he will maintain his financial 
responsibility.5 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
  
                                            
5 Failure to comply with payment plans or other delinquent debt will raise a security concern. The 
Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. The 
Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, 
and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking 
it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or 
circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-
06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, 
conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR
