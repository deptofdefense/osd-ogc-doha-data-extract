ISCR Case No. 15-00404
APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq. , Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
October 26, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On July 27, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert J. Kilmartin denied Applicant’s request for a
security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s brief raises no allegation of harmful error by the Judge.  Rather, it contains new
evidence, which we cannot consider.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant’s brief also cites to his having
hired a law firm to assist him with debt resolution.  The Judge addressed this matter in the Decision,
and Applicant’s brief does not assert that the Judge mis-weighed this evidence.  Our scope of review
is limited to cases in which the appealing party raises an allegation of harmful error.  Directive ¶
E3.1.32.  Insofar as Applicant has raised no such allegation, the Judge’s Decision is AFFIRMED.
