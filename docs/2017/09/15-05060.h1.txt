LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 19, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Applicant responded to the SOR on March 31, 2016, and elected to 
have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 25, 2016, 
Applicant changed her request to a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2016. The hearing was scheduled and 
continued twice at Applicant’s request. The hearing was convened as rescheduled on 
June 30, 2017. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through 
L, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to 
submit additional information. She submitted AE M, which was admitted without 
objection. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 11, 2017.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for 
her current employer since 2005. She has a bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 
1989. She also attended post-graduate school without earning another degree. She has 
been divorced since 2006. She has three children, ages 21, 18, and 15.1 
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts, unpaid 
taxes, a defaulted student loan, and a foreclosed home. She attributed her financial 
problems primarily to her divorce and raising three children as a single mother without 
significant child support from her ex-husband. She reported the foreclosure to her 
security officer in 2012. She reported her unpaid taxes, defaulted student loan, and 
foreclosure on her September 2014 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 
86).2 
 
 Applicant’s tax problems go back at least to 2000. The IRS filed a $30,432 tax 
lien against her in December 2013. She had additional taxes owed in several years 
because the IRS assessed additional taxes. She has had several installment 
agreements with the IRS. Her 2005 income tax refund was withheld and used to pay 
back taxes from 2000 and 2001. The IRS later reassessed her 2005 taxes and 
determined she owed an additional $5,982. Her 2005 taxes were paid in 2009 by 
payments and withholding her refund for tax year 2008. Her 2006 income taxes were 
paid in 2013. She received a $5,173 refund for tax year 2007. The IRS later reassessed 
her 2007 taxes and determined she owed an additional $6,392. She paid the IRS $450 
per month from February 2014 through January 2015, except her October 2014 
payment was dishonored. She made $250 payments in March and April 2015. She has 
been paying $250 per month since July 2015. Her 2007 income taxes were paid in 
2016.3 
 
 Applicant did not file her 2009 income tax return until February 2011, but she was 
due a refund. She did not file her 2010 return until March 2013. Her 2010 taxes were 
paid in 2016. She did not file her 2011 income tax return until March 2013. Her $250 
monthly payments are going toward this tax year. The balance with interest and 
penalties as of August 2017 was $4,551.4

2 Tr. at 14-19, 30, 33-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-6. The SOR did not allege the foreclosure. 
Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be 
considered when assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating 
conditions, and during the whole-person analysis.

 Applicant owes $10,862 with penalties and interest for tax year 2012. Her refund 
for tax year 2013 was transferred to pay her 2007 taxes. Her adjusted gross income for 
2014 was $158,853. Her $666 refund for 2014 was transferred to pay her 2007 taxes.5 
 
Applicant obtained a $10,186 student loan at 9% interest in December 1993. She 
either did not pay the loan or made minimal payments for years. In April 2014, her 
wages were garnished to pay the loan, which had increased to $48,061. The 
garnishment was lifted after several months as Applicant made voluntary payments. 
She was able to place the loan in forbearance. The loan is no longer considered in 
default, but it continued to accrue interest. The June 2016 credit report listed the 
balance on the loan as $45,694. The balance had increased to $50,812 on the June 
2017 credit report. Applicant stated that she was scheduled to resume making 
payments in June 2017.6 
 
 The SOR alleges the federal tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.a); the defaulted student loan 
(SOR ¶ 1.b); a $4,582 defaulted loan from the university she attended in 2010 and 2011 
(SOR ¶ 1.d); seven medical debts totaling $927 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g-1.l); and two 
miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling $489 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f). Applicant paid, 
settled, or otherwise resolved all of the debts with the exception of her federal taxes and 
the defaulted student loan discussed above.7 
 
Applicant stated that her finances are better. Her current annual salary is 
$136,000. Her ex-husband has been paying child support for more than two years. She 
received assistance with her taxes, but no formal financial counseling. She was able to 
buy a house. She stated that all her present responsibilities are paid on time. She is 
current on her mortgage and car loan.8 
 
 Applicant submitted a performance appraisal and a letter from her former 
supervisor. The documents reflect that Applicant’s job performance is excellent. She is 
praised for her reliability, dependability, trustworthiness, and honesty.9 
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017.

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
  Applicant has a history of financial problems including unpaid taxes and 
defaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant attributed her financial problems primarily to her divorce and raising 
three children as a single mother without significant child support from her ex-husband. 
However, her two major issues, the defaulted student loan and her unpaid taxes, 
predate her separation and divorce. The remaining debts have been paid, settled, or 
otherwise resolved. Those debts are mitigated. 
 
Compound interest has not been kind to Applicant. A $10,186 student loan at 9% 
in December 1993 now has a balance of more than $50,000 and increasing. Her unpaid 
taxes also come with interest and penalties. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests 
that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and 
systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting 
classified information. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-06686 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2016). 
 
Applicant has been paying her taxes through installment agreements and 
withholding of her income tax refunds for several years. She also paid her student loan 
long enough to take it out of default before it went into forbearance status. Her tax debt 
has decreased, but her student loan has increased. She still owes the IRS more than 
$15,000, and the balance on her student loan is more than $50,000.  
 
  There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They 
continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG 
¶ 20(a) is not applicable. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are partially applicable, 
but they do not completely mitigate the judgment issues raised by Applicant’s long-
standing neglect of her student loan and her failure to comply with the tax laws. I find 
that financial considerations concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s favorable 
job performance, character evidence, and candor in reporting her financial problems to 
her security officer and in her SF 86. However, she shirked her tax responsibilities for 
years, and she allowed a $10,186 student loan to grow to more than $50,000.   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.l:   For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
