HESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: 
 
 This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Applicant erroneously concluded that the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) was misapplying the tax laws and did not file or pay his Federal taxes for several 
years, which resulted in multiple tax liens filed against him. However, he has since 
recognized his error, filed and paid all requisite taxes, and satisfied the liens. He will 
continue to comply with all Federal tax requirements. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on May 21, 2012. On 
April 10, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
 
2 
 
 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.  
  
Applicant answered the SOR on April 25, 2016, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. On June 29, 2016, pursuant to the Directive, Department 
Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and notified Applicant of this 
action. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 1, 2016, and the case was 
assigned to me on September 26, 2016. On December 20, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for 
January 10, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 
through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel also offered 
three documents for Administrative Notice (AN), which were admitted without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A and B, which were admitted 
without objection. I kept the record open until January 24, 2017, to enable him to submit 
additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted three documents, which I have 
collectively admitted as AX C without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
January 19, 2017. 
Findings of Fact 
 
Based on the administrative notice documents, I find the following: Applicant was 
required by law to file tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2004; and, Applicant’s 
specific contentions for why he was not required to file or pay taxes have been previously 
adjudicated and rejected as meritless. 
 
The SOR alleges that: Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax 
years 1999 through 2004; between 2008 and 2012 five Federal tax liens totaling $221,405 
were filed against Applicant; and, Applicant’s wages were garnished to satisfy several of 
the liens. In his Answer, Applicant admits these allegations and explains the 
circumstances giving rise to his failure to file his returns and states that all liens were 
satisfied and released by November 2012. His admissions are incorporated in my findings 
of fact. The delinquent accounts are corroborated by the July 2015 and May 2014 credit 
bureau reports (CBR) (GX 4; GX 2.)  
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old systems engineer employed by a federal contractor 
since 2001, and employed in the defense industry since 1983. He served honorably on 
active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1974 to April 1983, and in the Navy Reserve 
from April 1983 until April 1985. He was granted a security clearance in 1976 while in the 
military and has maintained various levels of clearances since then. (GX 1; Tr. 35; Tr. 39-
40.) He received a bachelor’s of science degree in June 1983. He and his wife married in 
1980, and they have two adult children. (GX 1.)

 In 1995, Applicant was contacted by a friend who was planning on not filing his 
federal tax return and asked for Applicant’s assistance in interpreting the proper 
application of the tax statutes. In researching these issues, Applicant erroneously 
concluded that the tax statutes were being misapplied to a class of people of which he 
was included. (Tr. 44.) He continued to research these issues, and determined that he 
was not required to pay taxes on money he received in exchange for his labor, and that 
he could not sign his tax returns without committing perjury. Because of these 
conclusions, he did not file his Federal tax returns in 2000 for tax year 1999. He continued 
this practice through tax year 2004. Between 1995 and 2000, Applicant sent numerous 
letters to the IRS requesting clarification of the tax statutes but never received any return 
correspondence. He also attempted to consult with several tax attorneys, but none was 
willing to meet with him. (GX 2; Answer; Tr. 36-37; Tr. 51; Tr. 75.) 
 
  Applicant continued his research, including communicating with a number of 
people via the internet and reading several relevant books, and in 2006 found what he 
believed to be a correct way to file his tax returns without committing perjury. He timely 
filed his 2005 tax return as well as his returns for 1999 through 2004. (Tr. 60.) It was also 
in 2006 that Applicant received his first letter from the IRS stating that it had no record of 
Applicant filing tax returns for tax years 1999 through 2004. (Tr. 53.)   
 
At some point in 2008, Applicant received a letter from the IRS confirming that his 
1999 through 2005 returns were correctly filed. However, several months later, he 
received another letter from the IRS that stated his returns were not correctly filed. Soon 
thereafter, in September 2008, Applicant received notice of a Federal tax lien filed against 
him which encompassed tax years 1999 through 2005 in the amount of $146,486. 
Applicant promptly reported the lien to his facility security officer. (GX 3; GX 4; Tr. 63.)  
 
After receiving notice of the lien, Applicant mistakenly thought that he would have 
an opportunity to contest the lien and present his position on the proper application of the 
tax statutes in court, and took no action on the lien, (Tr. 37.) Applicant timely filed his 2006 
through 2009 tax returns in the same manner in which he filed his 1999 through 2005 
returns. (GX 1; GX 2.) 
 
In April 2010, the IRS served Applicant with a notice of lien for tax years 2005 and 
2006 in the amount of $47,955. (GX 3.) In May 2010, the IRS seized Applicant’s wife’s 
vehicle from Applicant’s driveway, and began garnishing Applicant’s wages. The 
garnishment continued until January 2011, with the IRS collecting $22,576 from 
Applicant’s pay. The IRS also seized money from Applicant’s bank accounts. (GX 1; GX 
2.) Shortly after Applicant’s wife’s car was seized, Applicant retained a tax attorney. The 
attorney assisted Applicant in filing new returns for tax years 1999 through 2009, 
instructed Applicant on how to properly file his tax returns going forward, enlightened 
Applicant about the applicability of the tax laws, and orchestrated the return of Applicant’s 
wife’s vehicle. (GX 2; GX 1; Tr. 76; Tr. 65.)

In December 2010, the IRS filed a lien against Applicant for tax year 2009 for 
$9,897. In April 2012, it filed a lien for tax years 2007 and 2008 for $7,067, and another 
for tax years 2008 and 2009 for $10,000. (GX3; GX 2.) Between May 2010 and August 
2012, Applicant paid all monies owed to the IRS, and all the liens were released between 
May 2012 and October 2012. (GX 3; GX 2.) Applicant disclosed his tax-related issues on 
his 2012 e-QIP and candidly discussed them with the investigator during his interview. 
(GX 1; GX 2.) 
 
 Applicant has properly filed his returns and paid his taxes without incident since 
tax year 2009. (Tr. 76-78; AX C.) Applicant, in part due to the influence of his tax attorney, 
although not immediately, has “had a change of heart regarding the matter.” (Tr. 66.) He 
admits that he reached “an erroneous conclusion that the law was being misapplied,” 
categorizes his actions as a mistake, continues to comply with all tax requirements, and 
vows to comply in the future. (Tr. 44; Tr. 79.) 
 
 Applicant has held a security clearance for over 40 years, and there is nothing in 
the record that suggests he has ever mishandled classified information. He worked for 
his previous federal-contractor employer for 18 years, and has worked for his current 
employer since 2001. His 2016 performance evaluation shows that he met or exceeded 
expectations in five areas and that he was rated expert in four areas. It also noted that 
Applicant was awarded three U.S. patents. (AX B.) Applicant’s testimony was straight-
forward and sincere. 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant’s meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 
5 
 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
6 
 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
  
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
  
 Applicant’s testimony, corroborated by the record evidence, establishes three 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 
19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal . . . income tax returns as required”). The following 
mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant erroneously determined that the tax laws were misapplied to him and he 
was not legally required to file or pay his taxes. The IRS did not agree with this position, 
and filed liens against him in 2008, 2010, and 2012. Applicant promptly reported the liens 
to his security officer, and disclosed his tax-related issues during his background 
investigation. After the IRS began seizing his assets in 2010, Applicant engaged the 
services of a tax attorney. Not only did the attorney assist Applicant in properly filing and 
paying his back taxes, but the attorney also instructed Applicant on how to properly handle 
his future taxes, and advised him about the applicability of the tax laws. Applicant has 
timely filed all his returns and paid all his taxes since 2009. He satisfied all the tax liens 
by October 2012. He sincerely recognizes that his conclusions about the applicability of 
the tax laws were wrong, and will continue to comply with all IRS requirements. 
Applicant’s prior tax-related financial concerns do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. 
 
7 
 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
  
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also 
considered the following: 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the military for almost 11 years, and continues to 
serve the defense industry. He has continuously held a security clearance for more than 
40 years. He was straight-forward and sincere in his testimony. I am confident that 
Applicant has learned from his mistakes and will continue to comply with the tax laws. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to file and pay taxes. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
  
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   For Applicant 
   
 
8 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is granted.
