Decision 
______________ 
 
FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 2, 2015. On June 8, 
2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent 
him a statement of reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the 
DOD on September 1, 2006. Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a 
hearing. 
 
The case was assigned to me on March 1, 2017, and I conducted the hearing as 
scheduled on April 25, 2017. On May 5, 2017, I notified Department Counsel that I 
intended to issue a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department Counsel did not 
object.  
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s mother was a citizen of Iraq, residing in Jordan, 
and that Applicant co-owned property in Iraq with his mother and two siblings. At the 
hearing, Applicant presented evidence that his mother had resided in Canada for the past 
two years and intends to remain there, and that he had sold his interest in the property in 
Iraq.  
 
Applicant is 53 years old. He was born in Iraq, came to the United States in 1983, 
and became a U.S. citizen in 1999. He has worked for defense contractors since 1996. 
He has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen since 1999, and his three children are 
native-born U.S. citizens. His siblings reside in Canada and the United Kingdom. 
 
I conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to refute the allegations in 
the SOR and mitigate any security concerns under Guideline B. The mitigating conditions 
in AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(b) are established.  
 
I conclude that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. Clearance is granted.
