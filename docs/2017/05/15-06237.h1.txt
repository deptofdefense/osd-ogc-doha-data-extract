KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility 
for access to classified information. Applicant mitigated the security concern based on his 
use of marijuana. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on November 13, 2014. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On April 15, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
2 
 
It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as 
Guideline H for drug involvement. Applicant answered the SOR on May 13, 2016, and 
requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On July 26, 2016, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on that same day. He was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on August 2, 2016.3 Applicant  
responded to the FORM on August 9, 2016. Applicant’s response to the FORM is marked 
as Applicant’s Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Included in the FORM were four items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits 1 through 3.4 Exhibits 1 through 3 are admitted into evidence. 
Exhibit 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took 
place during the March 2015 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated as 
required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s written brief includes a 
footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to 
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. The footnote is 
prominently prefaced with a bolded, upper-case notice to Applicant and flagging for 
Applicant the importance of the footnote, which then explains the concepts of 
authentication and waiver. In a case such as this, where Applicant has responded to the 
FORM, it is fair to conclude that Applicant read the footnote, understood it, and chose not 
to object to the ROI. The ROI is, therefore, admissible.   
  
 
 
 
 
                                                          
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in the 
Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 26, 2016, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated August 2, 2016. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 
days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR and Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and the Answer are the 
pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 2 through 4 are marked as Exhibits 1 through 
3.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 44 years old, married with two sons ages six and eight. He holds a 
bachelor’s and a master’s degree.6 Since April 2004, he has been employed by a defense 
contractor. The SOR alleges that (1) Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency 
from 1995 to July 2010, and (2) Applicant used marijuana after having been granted a 
security clearance in June 2005. Applicant admitted both allegations, however, noting as 
to the latter that his use occurred over ten years ago while camping. The allegation of his 
use of marijuana was based on Applicant’s disclosure in his security clearance application 
and during his background investigation interview. In both places Applicant disclosed that 
during that time period he used marijuana about once every two years. Applicant’s use of 
marijuana was during social occasions, not at work, and did not involve driving.7  
 
During the security clearance process, the record evolved as to whether Applicant 
used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. First, in his November 2014 
security clearance application, Applicant answered “No” to whether he used marijuana 
while possessing a security clearance. He also answered “No” to whether he had ever 
been investigated and granted a security clearance.8 Second, in his March 2015 
interview, he explained that in about 2004 or 2005 he filled out a security clearance 
application, because his employer planned to have him work on a project that required a 
clearance. That project, however, was cancelled, and Applicant was never interviewed 
and never received any feedback whether a clearance had been granted to him.9 
Therefore, when he filled out his security clearance application, he did not know whether 
he had a security clearance when he used marijuana.10 Third, as noted, Applicant 
qualifiedly admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR. Fourth, in Applicant’s 
response to the FORM, he states: “The issue with my renewal is the fact that I used 
marijuana on two occasions during the 10 to 12 years that I had a secret clearance.”11 
Finally, the evidence shows that Applicant was deemed to be eligible for a security 
clearance in June 2005.12 The record is unambiguous that Applicant stopped using 
marijuana in July 2010 and never intends to use marijuana again.13

Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.14 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”15 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.16 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.17 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.18 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.19 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.20 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.21 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.22 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23

Discussion 
  
 Under AG H for drug use,24 suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put 
into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a 
person’s ability or willingness to with laws, rules and regulations: 
 
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair 
judgment and because it raises questions about a person’s ability or 
willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 25(a) any drug abuse (use of illegal drugs); 
 
 AG ¶ 25(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; 
 
AG ¶ 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment, and   
 
AG ¶ 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future such 
as:  (3) an appropriate period of abstinence. 
  
The evidence supports a conclusion that between 1995 until July 2010 Applicant 
used marijuana. Disqualifying condition AG ¶ 25(a) applies. As noted, the record evolved  
whether Applicant used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. In his security 
clearance application, he claimed that he had not used marijuana while possessing a 
security clearance. In his interview, consistent with his security clearance application, he 
explained he did not know whether he had been granted a clearance in 2004 or 2005. In 
his answer to the SOR and his response to the FORM, however, Applicant admitted that 
he used marijuana on two occasions during the ten to 12 years that he held a secret 
clearance. And Government evidence shows that Applicant was found eligible for a 
security clearance in June 2005. I find that the evidence supports the conclusion that 
Applicant did use marijuana while possessing a security clearance, thus triggering 
disqualifying condition AG ¶ 26(g).25  
                                                          
 
24 AG ¶¶ 24, 25 and 26 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
25 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the 
SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and 
6 
 
 
The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. The evidence is that 
Applicant had a history of using marijuana, from 1995 to 2010, albeit on an infrequent 
basis, about once every two years. His use was in a social setting, not in a work 
environment, and not involving driving. His use while holding a security clearance was at 
most on two or three occasions. He stopped using marijuana almost seven years ago.  
Throughout the clearance process, he has categorically stated that he has no intent to 
use illegal drugs in the future. I conclude that the behavior happened so long ago that it 
is unlikely to recur, and that Applicant has demonstrated an appropriate period of 
abstinence and his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.  Mitigating conditions AG 
¶¶ 26(a) and (b)(3) apply.   
 
 The record does not raise doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.26 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for 
access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:                   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant access to classified information.
