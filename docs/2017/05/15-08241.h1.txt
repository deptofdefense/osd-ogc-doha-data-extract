KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility 
for access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial 
history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on June 25, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On January 27, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
 
 
2 
 
It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as 
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on February 24, 
2016, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On April 19, 2016, Department Counsel submitted a file of all relevant and material 
information (FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on April 28, 
2016. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 
10, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Included in the FORM were four items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits 1 through 4.3 Exhibits 1 through 3 are admitted into evidence. 
Exhibit 4 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took 
place during the September 2015 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated 
as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.4 Department Counsel’s written brief includes 
a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to 
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. Nevertheless, I am not 
persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond to the FORM, which response is 
optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement. 
The record does not demonstrate that Applicant understood the concepts of 
authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not demonstrate that he understood 
the implications of waiving an objection to the admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 
4 is inadmissible, and I have not considered the information in the ROI.    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 59 years old and is a college graduate. He has never married and has 
no children. Since June 2015, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. The 
SOR alleged that (1) Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax 
years 2011 through 2014, as required, and (2) Applicant has seven delinquent debts 
totaling approximately $83,243. Applicant admits that he failed to file tax returns for tax 
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in the 
Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The first two items in the FORM are the SOR and Applicant’s Answer, respectively. Because those items 
are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 3 through 6 are marked as Exhibits 
1 through 4.  
 
4 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

years 2011, 2012 and 2014, as alleged. He states that he did not make enough income 
in 2013 to be required to file returns. He states that he was unemployed from 2010 until 
2014, because his job was outsourced.5 As a result, he failed to file, because he did not 
have enough money to pay any back taxes. He also indicated that he is having a tax 
preparer file the overdue tax returns.6 In addition, he states that he intends to set up a 
payment plan to satisfy any back taxes.  
 
The bulk of Applicant’s indebtedness is attributable to a past-due first mortgage 
($52,517) and a charged-off second mortgage ($27,941) on his home.7 Those mortgages 
went into default in November 2011 and January 2012, during the period of Applicant’ 
unemployment.8 Applicant denies those two allegations and claims that his home went 
through foreclosure in February 2014, and that he believed that those mortgages were 
satisfied by the foreclosure. The January 2016 credit report, however, almost two years 
after the foreclosure, shows those mortgages with past-due balances ($52,517 on the 
first mortgage and $31,342 on the second mortgage).9 The remainder of the delinquent 
debt is made up of five consumer accounts totaling $2,735.10 Applicant’s Answer 
documented that three of those debts (totaling $2,037) were resolved in February 2016.11 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.12 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”13 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.

 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.14 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.15 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.16 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.17 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.18 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.19 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.20 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,22 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information.23

 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required of the fraudulent filing of same;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under AG ¶¶ 19(a), (c), and (g). The first 
cause for concern is Applicant’s failure to file federal and state income tax returns for 
2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. That failure triggers disqualifying condition AG ¶ 19(g). 
Applicant’s repeated failure to file his federal and state income tax returns in a timely 
manner does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required 
of persons granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 
at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). 
 
Applicant offers a number of excuses.  He notes that he was unemployed from 
2010 through most of 2014, because his job was outsourced. That is admittedly a 
circumstance largely beyond his control, under AG ¶ 20(b).  That does not, however, end 
the inquiry. Applicant’s conduct under those adverse circumstances must be responsible.  
Applicant’s unemployment, however, is not a defense to his failure to file tax returns.24 
He next offers that because he was unemployed he did not have the money to pay any 
tax liability. That may have been true, but that does not excuse his failure to file tax 
                                                          
24 Applicant claims that he did not make sufficient income in 2013 to be required to file returns. There is 
nothing in the record to rebut that contention. Accordingly, I find that Applicant mitigated the allegation that 
he failed to file returns for tax year 2013.

returns. In fact, failure to file returns can result in penalties and interest charges, thus 
aggravating any tax liability. Finally, he answered that he has directed a tax preparer to 
file the overdue returns, and, if necessary, Applicant will make payment arrangements for 
any tax liability. He gave those directions, however, in February 2016, only after the SOR 
had been issued, in January 2016.  The timing of resolution of the financial problems is 
relevant in determining the extent to which an applicant has demonstrated mitigation. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-07551 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2011). Taking action to resolve 
the delinquent tax filings well after the initiation of the security clearance process 
undercuts a determination that those actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the 
delinquencies.25 I conclude that Applicant’s failure to file income tax returns during his 
period of unemployment was not responsible conduct under AG ¶ 20(b). Nor do other 
Guideline F mitigating conditions apply.   
 
Applicant’s two delinquent mortgage accounts are the second cause for security 
concern. Those two mortgage accounts trigger disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
(c). Those two mortgages went into default during the period of Applicant’s 
unemployment, a circumstance largely beyond his control, under AG ¶ 20(b).  Applicant’s 
understanding is that those two mortgages were satisfied by the foreclosure.  The credit 
report, however, shows that as recently as January 2016 those two mortgages are still 
reporting past-due balances.26 Applicant has produced no documentation to support his 
belief. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that 
applicants must present documentation to support their claims that debts have been 
resolved.27 I conclude that none of the Guideline F mitigating conditions apply.  
 
 The record creates doubt about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.28 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
                                                          
25 The same reasoning holds true for the three consumer debts Applicant resolved in February 2016, after 
the SOR had been issued, in January 2016. Nevertheless, those consumer debts, standing alone, would 
not be cause for security concerns. Accordingly, I find that those three debts have been mitigated. Because 
Applicant did not document that SOR debts 1.c and 1.h were paid, I cannot find that they have been 
mitigated. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008) (it is reasonable for a judge to 
expect an applicant to present documentation about the satisfaction or other resolution of individual debts); 
ISCR Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007).
