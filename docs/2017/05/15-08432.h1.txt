TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines F (financial 
considerations) and E (personal conduct). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 20, 2014, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF-86). On March 15, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 
1, 2006.  
 
 The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F and E and detailed 
reasons why DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and referred his case to

an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted or 
denied. 
 
On April 7, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated May 9, 2016, was provided to him by letter dated May 12, 2016. 
Applicant received the FORM on May 16, 2016. He was afforded a period of 30 days to 
file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did 
not submit any information within the 30-day period. On April 6, 2017, the case was 
assigned to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under Guideline F, except for SOR 
¶ 1.aa with explanations, and neither admitted nor denied the falsification allegation 
under Guideline E with explanations. Accordingly, I have construed Applicant’s 
response to the Guideline E allegation as a denial. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Background Information1 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old configuration manager employed by a defense 
contractor since October 2014. (Item 3) He graduated from high school in June 1992. 
(Item 7) Applicant married in June 2006 and listed his current marital status as being 
separated as of September 2013. He is unaware of his estranged wife’s whereabouts. 
(Items 3, 7)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s SOR lists 29 separate allegations – one 2011 judgment, five bad 
check criminal charges filed against him, two allegations of checks issued for insufficient 
funds, and 21 delinquent debts in varying amounts ranging from a $146 credit card 
collection account to a $4,958 charged-off credit card account. These debts are 
substantiated by Applicant’s admissions, court records, January 2015 Office of 
Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI), and October 2014 and 
November 2015 credit reports. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.cc; Items 4 - 8)  
 
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to his estranged wife mismanaging 
their finances and forging his signature on checks that resulted in charges being filed 
against him. The five bad check charges occurred during the timeframe of 2006 to 
2011. Applicant claimed that several of the debts alleged had been paid, but provided 
no documentation of same. In his June 2017 SOR answer, he further claimed that he 
had never considered bankruptcy and was looking into debt consolidation. (Items 2, 7) 
                                                          
1 The limited background information regarding Applicant was derived from the FORM and was 
the most current information available.

Applicant was confronted with his delinquent debts during his January 2015 OPM PSI 
and claimed to be unaware of them adding that he would follow up on all accounts and 
try to pay them off. (Item 7) 
 
  The file lacks any evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, 
compromised, disputed, or otherwise resolved any of the delinquent SOR accounts. He 
did not describe financial counseling or present a budget. The record lacks 
corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of the causes 
for his financial problems and other mitigating information. The FORM noted that 
Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary 
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as 
appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional information . . . 
your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” 
on the evidence set forth in this FORM.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 When Applicant completed his October 2014 SF-86, he failed to list any adverse 
financial information. (Item 2, 3) During his January 2015 OPM PSI, Applicant claimed 
that he answered no to financial information questions because he was not sure that he 
had delinquent bills because he had separated from his wife and she was in charge of 
the bills and never informed him of any late or  delinquent accounts. (Item 7) In his June 
2017 SOR answer, Applicant stated that he answered questions regarding his financial 
situation to the best of his ability on his SF-86. He claimed that he did not intentionally 
lie on his SF-86 nor was it his intent to be deceptive knowing any falsifications would be 
discovered during his background investigation.  (Item 2)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
      
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations/Personal Conduct 
  
  The Government met its burden of production in support of the allegations in the 
SOR. The facts established raise a security concern addressed, in relevant part, at AG 
¶ 18 as follows: 
  
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
More specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying 
conditions at AG ¶ 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and 19(c) (a history 
of not meeting financial obligations). In response to the Government’s information, it 
was incumbent on Applicant to produce information sufficient to refute or mitigate the 
facts established against him. He did not submit any documents in response to the SOR 
or the FORM. Applicant did not show that he had paid or otherwise resolved any of his 
delinquent debt.  
 
The Government also met its burden of production in support of the allegation 
under personal conduct. The facts established raise a security concern addressed in 
relevant part, at AG ¶ 15 as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
More specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying 
condition at AG ¶ 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities). 
 
Applicant failed to list his debts as required on his SF-86. None of the mitigating 
conditions in AG ¶ 17 apply. Applicant’s explanation that he was unaware about the 
state of his finances lacks credibility given the number of debts involved, the length of 
time over which the debts were incurred, and the fact that charges were filed against 
him five times for writing bad checks. His explanations for providing false information on 
his SF-86 are not enough to overcome his willful misrepresentation of his true financial 
situation or past personal conduct.2 He knowingly and deliberately chose not to disclose 
complete and accurate information regarding his financial history.  
                                                          
2The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In summary, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by the 
Government’s information. In addition to evaluating the facts and applying the 
appropriate adjudicative factors under Guidelines F and E, I have reviewed the record 
before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Applicant has 
been gainfully employed for the majority of his adult life, and he is presumed to be a 
mature, responsible citizen. Protection of the national interest is the principal focus of 
these adjudications. According, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant.  
 
In requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the 
written record. In so doing, however, he failed to submit sufficient evidence to 
supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his circumstances, 
articulate his position, and mitigate the security concerns. With regard to financial 
considerations concerns, he failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide 
documentation regarding his past efforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to 
provide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to 
establish mitigation, security concerns remain. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
The formal findings on the SOR are as follows: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
   Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.cc:  Against Applicant 
 
  Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
   Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
      
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
