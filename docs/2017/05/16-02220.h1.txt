MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 11, 2015. On 
August 19, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on October 5, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
November 7, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on January 25, 2017. On 
February 27, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 28, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. I appended to the record a letter that Government sent to Applicant as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted 
without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant, age 47, divorced his wife of eight years in 2014. They have two sons, 
ages 11 and 9. He received an aerospace engineering B.A. degree in 1991, a 
mechanical engineering M.A. degree in 1993, and completed most of the coursework 
required for a Ph.D degree. Applicant has been employed full time as an engineer with 
the same federal contractor since 1994, and has maintained a security clearance for 
most of that time.2 Since 2005, he has also held a part-time job as a referee.  
 
Applicant admitted both SOR allegations involving his failure to file, as required, 
federal (SOR ¶ 1.a) and state (SOR ¶ 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2012 
through 2014. He also reported the issue on his SCA. He attributes his failure to file to 
being unable to navigate the more complicated filing process due to his separation and 
divorce. He did not believe he could afford to hire a professional to help him due to his 
then overextended finances. While he did not anticipate owing any delinquent taxes, he 
had a plan in place to pay them in the event that it was determined that he did owe. As 
such, he believed he was better off filing his complicated tax returns late rather than risk 
filing them incorrectly.3 He was unaware of the criminal or security-related 
consequences of his failure to timely file.4 He also did not perceive the IRS inquiries 
regarding his non-filing as an indication that he needed to take immediate action.5 Prior 
to 2012, Applicant filed his income tax returns on time each year.6  
 
In May 2012, Applicant separated from his wife, who also then stopped 
contributing to their household finances. As a result, his annual household income 
dropped from about $150,000 to $90,000 and his finances became overextended. 
Except for a few expenses that were divided by a February 2013 court order, Applicant 
was primarily responsible for their joint expenses, including those of their children, until 
the divorce was finalized.7 One of those expenses included a deduction from his 
                                                          
1 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from 
Applicant’s SOR answer, SCA (GE 1), and the summary of his personal subject interview (GE 2).

paycheck to repay a 401k loan taken out during the marriage to resolve a high-interest 
mortgage loan.8 Since early 2016, when he paid off a car loan and the 401k loan, his 
finances have not been overextended.9 His current finances are in good order.10 
 
In March 2016, Applicant sought the assistance of a friend who is a certified tax 
volunteer in the IRS’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. With his help, 
Applicant filed his 2015 tax returns on time and concurrently began the process of 
completing his 2012 through 2014 tax returns, well before the SOR was issued. Over 
several months, Applicant diligently worked through his more complicated tax-filing 
requirements and eventually completed the filings of those returns in December 2016.11 
As expected, his state and federal income tax withholdings for each of those tax years 
exceeded the taxes due so he incurred no taxes or penalties.12 He is committed to filing 
all future returns in a timely fashion.13 To that end, he created a spreadsheet that keeps 
track of the information required for him to file so he can easily update it from year to 
year.14 
 
Applicant’s coworker of 18 years who is also a close friend says that Applicant 
has consistently demonstrated integrity and trustworthiness. He described him as a 
loyal friend and caring father. He commended Applicant for staying focused on caring 
for his sons and maintaining his home, while working full time during a long divorce 
process. He observed the severe emotional turmoil that Applicant experienced during 
that time. This individual is the same person who educated Applicant about the various 
tax issues with which Applicant was otherwise unfamiliar, and who assisted Applicant 
with filing his delinquent and 2015 tax returns.15 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”16 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such

information.”17 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”18 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”19 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.20 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”21 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.22 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,

extenuate, or mitigate the facts.23 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.24 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”25 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”26 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds . . . .  
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file, as required, his federal and state tax returns for 
tax years 2012 through 2014 establishes AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same”). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.

AG ¶ 20(a) is established. Applicant failed to timely file his 2012 through 2014 tax 
returns during a distinct period of time that coincides with the financial and emotional 
effects of his transition from married to divorced. Prior to that period, he filed his tax 
returns on time each year. He filed his 2015 returns on time and is committed to filing all 
future returns in a timely fashion. Not only did Applicant’s delayed filings occur under 
circumstances not likely to recur, but they do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are established. Applicant sought the assistance of a 
certified tax volunteer to assist him with filing his overdue tax returns well before the 
SOR was issued. He worked diligently during the course of nine months to complete his 
overdue returns, which were filed before his hearing. He filed his 2015 tax returns on 
time and intends to file all future returns on time. To ensure his success in following 
through on his commitment, he developed a spreadsheet and has the resource of a 
knowledgeable friend to assist him when needed. Applicant incurred no tax liability and 
has otherwise managed his finances responsibly.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the AG ¶ 2(a) factors. Applicant was candid, sincere, 
and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions 
under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to 
timely file his income tax returns. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of 
showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for 
access to classified information.
