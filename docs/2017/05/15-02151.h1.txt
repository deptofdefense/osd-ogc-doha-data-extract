Decision

ROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: 
 
On June 27, 2014, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 3.) On September 30, 2015, the Department of 
Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 15, 2016,1 and 
requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 
                                            
1 The date on the Answer is January 15, 2015, but that is obviously in error since the SOR is dated 
September 30, 2015.

24, 2016, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 6, was provided to 
Applicant, who received the file on March 16, 2016.2  
 
 Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any 
additional information. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2016. Based 
upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 38 and divorced. He has been employed by a defense contractor 
since 2013 and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  
 
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) 
 
 The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for 
clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, 
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant 
admitted both allegations under this paragraph. Those admissions are findings of fact.  
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant owes two debts, totaling approximately $11,982. 
The existence and amount of the debts is supported by credit reports concerning the 
Applicant dated December 10, 2014; and February 10, 2016. (Items 5 and 6.) 
 
 1.a. Applicant served in his state National Guard, either in active or inactive 
status, from 2003 until January 2013. Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan in 2008 
and 2009. He received a General Discharge in 2013 because he moved out of state and 
was unable to fulfill his enlistment obligation. (Item 3 at Sections 15, 26.) 
 
 Applicant received a reenlistment bonus while a member of the National Guard. 
When he left the National Guard he was required to repay a portion of that bonus to the 
Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). In his e-QIP Applicant estimated the 
amount of money he owed as $13,015. The SOR and Item 5 state the amount as 
$11,407. Item 6 shows the amount owed as of February 2016 to be $9,634. In his e-QIP 
and Answer Applicant states that he is attempting to set up a payment plan with the 
                                            
2 Department Counsel submitted six Items in support of the SOR allegations.  Item 4 is inadmissible. It 
will not be considered or cited as evidence in this case. It is the summary of an unsworn interview of 
Applicant conducted by an interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management on August 5, 2014. 
Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, or otherwise certify it to be accurate. Under 
Directive ¶ E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation summary is inadmissible in the absence of an 
authenticating witness. In light of Applicant’s admissions, it is also cumulative.

collection agency handling the debt. No further information was provided showing that 
he had made any payment arrangements concerning this debt. This debt is not 
resolved. 
 
 1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed a collection agency $575 for a past-due 
account. He stated in his Answer, “I have disputed this and awaiting information from 
[collection agency].” No further information was provided. This debt is not resolved.  
 
 Applicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job 
performance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to 
establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his 
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided 
without a hearing. 
 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) 
requires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
According to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to 
establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, “The 
applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, 
and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance 
decision.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information.  
 
Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, “Any 
determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
 
Analysis 
 
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant, based on documentary evidence, had two delinquent 
accounts that he could not resolve. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
 The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), disqualifying conditions 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG 
¶ 20(b) states that disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where “the conditions that 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.”   
 
 The evidence shows that neither of the above mitigating conditions apply to 
Applicant. Applicant continues to owe a considerable amount of money to DFAS as a 
result of his voluntary decision to end his enlistment early. In addition, no evidence was 
submitted to show that he has made any attempts to resolve the other, relatively small, 
debt. He did not submit documentary evidence of any dispute concerning 1.b, therefore 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. It is Applicant’s responsibility to set forth his financial 
situation in sufficient detail to support a finding that he has “initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” as required by AG ¶ 20(d). I am 
unable to do so in this case. Given the state of the record, I cannot find that his current 
financial situation is stable. Finally, I do not find that “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control,” as required by AG ¶ 20(c). Paragraph 1 
is found against Applicant. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant’s financial irresponsibility is 
recent, voluntary, and occurred when he was a mature adult. Rehabilitation was not 
demonstrated, nor was unlikelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence as 
described above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance at the present time. For all these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the 
guideline for Financial Considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
            Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   Against Applicant 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
