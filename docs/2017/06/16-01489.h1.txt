DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under the guideline 
for financial considerations. National security eligibility is denied. 
 
History of the Case 
 
On June 1, 2015, Applicant submitted an application for public trust position (SF-
85P). On July 13, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging trustworthiness 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective on September 1, 2006. This decision applies the New 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) that came into effect on June 8, 2017.1  
  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 10, 2016 (Answer), and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings 
                                            
1I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new 
Adjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was 
considered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines.

and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on October 7, 2016. It issued a Notice of 
Hearing on December 21, 2016, scheduling the hearing for January 19, 2017. On 
January 6, 2017, DOHA issued an amended Notice of Hearing rescheduling the hearing 
to January 17, 2017. The hearing convened as re-scheduled. Department Counsel 
offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. Applicant testified, and 
offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P into evidence. All exhibits were admitted 
without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 25, 
2017. The record remained open until February 10, 2017, to give Applicant an 
opportunity to provide additional exhibits. That deadline was extended to March 20, 
2017. Applicant submitted AE Q through U. Department Counsel had no objections to 
those exhibits and they are admitted into the record.    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted all 15 allegations in the SOR, and provided explanations. Her 
admissions are incorporated into these findings.  
 
Applicant is 48 years old and unmarried. She has a 28-year-old son, who no 
longer lives with her. Applicant has earned 55 college credits. She has certifications in 
computer technology and phlebotomy. She began working for her current employer in 
June 2015. She performs some community service. (Tr. 13-17.) 
 
Applicant attributed her financial problems to several factors. They include: in 
2008 her ill father moved in with her until his death in 2014; a $3,000 funeral for her 
father; being a single mother; insufficient money after she moved for her job; periods of 
unemployment, from March 2015 to June 2015, September 2009 to March 2010, and 
June 2012 through November 2012; and money mismanagement. (Tr. 18-19; 27-30, 
66.) 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $65,000. It is the largest salary she has earned. Prior 
to this job, she earned between $43,000 and $48,000 annually. (Tr. 30-31.) According 
to her budget, her net monthly income is $5,416 and expenses are $3,192, leaving 
about $1,658 remaining. Recently, she began a weekend position with a hospital to 
earn additional money. She has not sought credit or financial counseling since she was 
about 30 years old. (Tr. 67-68.) Applicant sends her mother $200 to $300 each month to 
help pay expenses for Applicant’s son, and two grandchildren, who live with her mother. 
(Tr. 65; AE A.)  
 
Other than one student loan, mentioned below, all of Applicant’s student loans 
are consolidated. They were deferred until December 2016. She began making $100 
monthly payments toward these consolidated loans this month. (Tr. 33-34.) 
 
Applicant owes state taxes for years 2003 to 2012, including the monies owed for 
the tax liens filed in 2008 and 2009, as alleged in the SOR.2 As of January 24, 2017, 
                                            
2 The SOR did not allege the specific state tax years that underlie the 2008 and 2009 liens, and the 
evidence does not identify the years. (Tr. 42.) Only the two alleged liens will be analyzed as potential 
 
  3 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
she owed $13,862, and agreed to begin making automatic monthly payments of $240 
on March 15, 2017. Her agreement is for 60 months. She previously made monthly 
payments of $192 on a tax payment plan she had negotiated with the state. She made 
those payments for six months, and then stopped in March 2015 because she did not 
have enough money. (Tr. 47-48; AE M, AE P.)  
 
Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from June 2015 and April 2016, the SOR 
alleged 15 delinquent debts, which became delinquent between 2008 and 2015, and 
totaled $12,667. (GE 2, GE 3.) The status of each debt is as follows: 
 
1. (SOR ¶ 1.a) The $6,381 student loan was charged off in 2015. Applicant 
negotiated a $797 settlement on January 9, 2017, and paid it on January 31, 2017. (Tr.  
32; AE F.) This debt is resolved. 
 
2. (SOR ¶ 1.b) The $872 charged off utility bill was paid on January 31, 2017. 
(AE O.) It is resolved. 
 
3. (SOR ¶ 1.c) The $403 debt was owed to a cable provider for a cancellation 
fee.  Applicant paid it on March 15, 2017. (Tr. 51; AE S.) It is resolved.  
 
4. (SOR ¶ 1.d) The $307 debt was owed to collection agency for a utility bill. It 
was removed from her CBR in August 2016. In January 2017, the agency notified 
Applicant that it was discontinuing collection efforts. (Tr. 55; AE L.) It is resolved. 
 
5. (SOR ¶ 1.e) The $223 debt is owed to the same telecommunications creditor 
as listed in ¶ 1.c. Applicant paid this debt on January 28, 2017. (AE N.) It is resolved. 
 
6. (SOR ¶ 1.f) The $202 debt was owed to gas company. Applicant stated she 
paid it on January 31, 2017. (AE S.) It is resolved. 
 
7. (SOR ¶ 1.g) The $116 is an unpaid medical debt. It was removed from her 
CBR in May 2016. She spoke to the creditor and inquired about paying it. She said the 
creditor does not have a record of it. (AE L; AE U.) It is resolved.  
 
8. (SOR ¶ 1.h) The $76 medical debt was paid on January 13, 2017. (AE D.) It is 
resolved. 
 
9. (SOR ¶ 1.i) The $28 medical debt was paid on January 30, 2017. (AE P.) It is 
resolved. 
 
                                                                                                                                            
disqualifying conditions. However, all unpaid state tax years, from 2003 to 2012, may be considered 
under the analysis of mitigating conditions and whole-person concept, in addition to Applicant’s credibility.

10. (SOR ¶ 1.j) The $2,298 state income tax lien was entered 2008.3 It remains 
unresolved. 
 
11. (SOR ¶ 1.k) The $979 state income tax lien was entered 2009. It remains 
unresolved.    
 
12. (SOR ¶ 1.l) The $306 water debt was paid on March 20, 2017. (AE Q.)  It is 
resolved. 
 
13. (SOR ¶ 1.m) The $244 cable debt was closed in 2011 by the creditor. (AE R.) 
It is resolved. 
 
14. (SOR ¶ 1.n) This $50 debt is owed to a city for parking tickets. Applicant 
spoke to the city on January 24, 2017. The city has no information about it. (AE U.) It is 
resolved.   
 
15. (SOR ¶ 1.o) This $182 debt owed to an insurance company was paid on 
January 13, 2017. (AE E.) This debt is resolved. 
 
Applicant submitted her 2016 mid-year and year-end performance evaluations. 
Her supervisor described her as a “strong team contributor,” who provided “solid 
support” for the team. (AE J, AE K.) 
 
Policies 
 
Positions designated as ADP-I/II/III are classified as “sensitive positions.” (See 
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” (See 
Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence 
and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness 
adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to the DOD and DOHA by the Defense 
Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. DOD contractor personnel are 
afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.)  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative 
judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AGs. These 
guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2, 
describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative 
goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. 
                                            
3Applicant submitted an exhibit indicating that in 2003 the state filed a state tax execution (lien) for unpaid 
taxes for 2001, in the amount of $2,593. That lien was cancelled in December 2016, and does not appear 
to relate to either SOR allegation. (AE H, AE I.)  
 
  5 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture. 
  
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states that an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.” 
 
 A person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive 
information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, “[a]ny 
determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 sets out the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial 
considerations: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
 
  6 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 describes four conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. 
 
  Applicant has a history of being unable or unwilling to satisfy financial obligations 
that began before 2008 and continued to 2015. That history also includes failing to pay 
annual state income taxes, as documented by two tax liens entered in 2008 and 2009.  
The evidence raised the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
AG ¶ 20 provides five conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns 
raised under this guideline by the evidence in this case: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by 
predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem 
from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling 
service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file 
or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.  
 
The evidence does not establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s 
numerous financial problems have been ongoing for many years, including unpaid state 
 
  7 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
taxes. The evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). Some of 
Applicant’s financial problems resulted from periods of unemployment, her father’s 
illness and death, and being the sole support for her son. Those were circumstances 
largely beyond her control. However, Applicant acknowledged that some problems were 
caused by her financial mismanagement, which was not a circumstance beyond her 
control. In addition, she did not provide evidence that she acted responsibly under those 
circumstances, which is necessary for full mitigation under this condition. AG ¶ 20(c) 
provides no mitigation, since she has not sought financial counseling in more than 18 
years and all debts of concern arose since that time.  
 
Applicant presented a budget, which accommodates her ongoing expenses, and 
has room to pay delinquent debts. There are some indications that her financial 
problems are slowly resolving and coming under control, as noted by the numerous 
delinquent debts she recently paid. She established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d), 
as she presented documentation that she attempted to make good-faith efforts to 
address and repay all SOR delinquent debts, albeit recent and post-hearing. 
 
At this time, she has not established a history of compliance with her tax 
repayment agreement sufficient to warrant mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g). In March 2015, 
after having made six payments, Applicant stopped making payments on a negotiated 
repayment plan for unpaid taxes. On January 17, 2017, she acknowledged that she 
owed $13,862 for unpaid taxes for years 2003 to 2015, and agreed to begin making 
automatic monthly payments of $240 on March 15, 2017. She took no action to resolve 
those unpaid tax debts between March 2015 and March 2017.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate 
determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be an overall 
commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the 
whole-person concept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 48-year-old 
intelligent and hard-working woman, as noted by her employer. She has encountered 
 
  8 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
several circumstances over the past years that affected her financial situation, some of 
which were beyond her control and others not. Since the initiation of this investigation, 
she began paying more attention to her finances, as demonstrated by her efforts to pay 
and resolve the alleged delinquent debts, although many were resolved in January 
2017. Nonetheless, they are resolved. In January 2017, she also re-negotiated a 
payment plan for old and unpaid taxes. She previously had a similar plan and made six 
payments toward those taxes before stopping in March 2015, two years ago. At this 
time, she has not established a solid record of financial management or payments on 
her new tax agreement.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all relevant facts 
and circumstances in the context of the whole-person, Applicant mitigated all SOR-
alleged debts, except two old tax liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k. Overall, the record 
evidence leaves doubt as to Applicant’s present national security eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:     For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:     Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.l through 1.o:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility 
for a position of trust. Eligibility is denied.
