Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
use of marijuana.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on September 11, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On June 17, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudication Guidelines (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
2 
 
in a civil court case. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security 
guideline known as Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse. Applicant 
answered the SOR on July 8, 2016, and requested a decision based on the written record 
without a hearing.   
 
On August 31, 2016, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on the next day. He was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on September 12, 2016.3 
Applicant responded to the FORM on September 19, 2016. Applicant’s response is 
marked as Exhibit A, and because the Government did not object, Exhibit A is admitted 
into evidence. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were four items of evidence, two of which are marked as 
Government Exhibits 1 and 2 and are admitted into evidence.4 Exhibit 2 is a report of 
investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took place during the 
November 2015 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated, as required 
under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s written brief includes a footnote 
advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to object may 
constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. The footnote is prominently 
prefaced with a bolded, upper-case notice to Applicant flagging the importance of the 
footnote, which then explains the concepts of authentication and waiver. In a case such 
as this, where Applicant has responded to the FORM, it is fair to conclude that Applicant 
read the footnote, understood it, and chose not to object to the ROI. The ROI is, therefore, 
admissible.   
 
 
 
                                                          
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My Decision and 
Formal Findings under the revised Guidelines H and E would not be different under the 2006 Guidelines.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 1, 2016, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated September 12, 2016. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he 
had 30 days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR, and the second item is Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and 
the Answer are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 3 and 4 are marked as 
Exhibits 1 and 2.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate who is married with one minor 
child. Since September 2015, he has worked for a defense contractor.  
 
The SOR alleged that (1) Applicant used marijuana from January 2008 until July 
2015, and (2) Applicant purchased marijuana from January 2008 until March 2015.6 
Applicant admitted those allegations. He also stated in his Answer that (1) he has not 
used marijuana since July 2015, (2) he has no intention in doing so in the future, and (3) 
he is willing to sign a letter of intent to submit to random urinalysis, knowing that a positive 
result will cause the revocation of his clearance. He also stated that he has disassociated 
himself from his former (presumably drug-using) friends and has focused on his career.7 
In his interview, Applicant was asked when he first used marijuana. He admitted that he 
used marijuana before the seven-year period covered by the SF 86 (i.e., before January 
2008) but declined to discuss that prior use any further.8 He used marijuana three to five 
times a week to help him sleep.9 In his response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a 
signed and dated statement promising that he will refrain from illegal drug use knowing 
that any violation will result in the automatic revocation of his clearance.10 Attached to 
Applicant’s Answer was a letter from his manager stating she has known Applicant since 
November 2015, that he consistently displays sound judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness, is a model employee, and one who shows exceptional performance and 
dedication.11 
 
             Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.12 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”13 Under Egan, E.O. 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an 
applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of 
protecting national security.

 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.14 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.15 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.16 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.17 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.18 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.19 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.20 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21 
 
      Discussion 
 
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse 
 
 Under AG H for drug use,22 suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put 
into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a 
person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations: 
 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription 
and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause 
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their 
intended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and 
trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or

psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's 
ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled 
substance means any "controlled substance" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. 
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any 
of the behaviors listed above. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  
 
AG ¶ 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug 
paraphernalia; 
 
AG ¶ 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and,  
 
AG ¶ 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and 
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this 
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not 
limited to: 
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and,   
 
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future 
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security 
eligibility.  
 
Applicant admitted his use of marijuana from January 2008 until July 2015 and that 
he purchased marijuana from January 2008 until March 2015, as alleged in the SOR. In 
his interview, he also admitted that he used marijuana three to five times per week before 
January 2008. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR or in an interview 
require no further proof by the Government.23 Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled 
substance, and its possession is regulated by the federal government under the 
Controlled Substances Act.24 The knowing or intentional possession and use of any 
                                                          
23 ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR 
allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 
(App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal 
basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).   
 
24 21 U.S.C. § 811 et seq.

controlled substance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment and or a fine.25 In an 
October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed that the 
use of marijuana is relevant to national security determinations, regardless of changes to 
state laws concerning marijuana use.26 AG ¶¶ 25(a) and (c) apply.  
 
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant used marijuana between 
three to five times per week from sometime before January 2008 until July 2015. His 
behavior was neither infrequent, nor did it occur long ago, with his last use being in July 
2015. AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply. 
 
I also considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(b). I credit Applicant’s answer to the 
SOR and his response to the FORM as showing that (1) he has disassociated himself 
from drug-using friends, and (2) he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from 
all illegal drug usage and that any such use would be grounds for revocation of his security 
clearance. Applicant has established AG ¶¶ 26(b)(1) and (3). AG ¶ 26(b), however, 
requires that an applicant show an “established pattern of abstinence.” The record shows 
that sometime before January 2008 Applicant began using marijuana between three to 
five times per week until July 2015, when he stopped such use. The record was closed 
on September 26, 2016, upon admission of Applicant’s response to the FORM.  
Thus, at the close of the record, Applicant’s period of abstinence was just over one year.27 
Given that Applicant used marijuana for more than seven and a half years before deciding 
to stop such use, I cannot find that he has shown an “established pattern of abstinence.” 
AG ¶ 26(b) does not apply.   ` 
 
Conclusion 
 
         The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, 
and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the 
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.28 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:                           Against Applicant 
    
  Subparagraph 1.b:                           Against Applicant 
                     
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
