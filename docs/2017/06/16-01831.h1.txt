FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 26, 2015. 
On November 9, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1  
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines. The SEAD 4 guidelines apply to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 
8, 2017. My decision is based on the guidelines in SEAD 4, hereinafter referred to as “AG.” The changes 
resulting from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on November 30, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 
31, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 2, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for March 23, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted 
without objection. Department Counsel’s letter to Applicant dated January 31, 2017, 
complying with the discovery requirement of Directive ¶ E3.1.13, is attached to the 
record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I kept the record open until April 21, 2017, to enable 
Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX F and G, 
which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX 
F and G are attached to the record as HX II and III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 
on April 4, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d and 1.f. He 
denied SOR ¶ 1.e. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in 
my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 42-year-old electronics technician employed by a defense 
contractor since August 2015. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 
December 2003 to October 2013 and received an honorable discharge. He attended a 
university from September 2013 to May 2015 but did not receive a degree. He held a 
security clearance while in the Navy. 
 
 Applicant married in February 2007 and divorced in April 2010 because of his 
wife’s infidelity. He has a nine-year-old son born during the marriage. 
 
 Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2001 and received a 
discharge in October 2001. The bankruptcy was triggered by his loss of employment at 
a microchip-manufacturing business that failed. (Tr. 36-37.) Notwithstanding the 
bankruptcy, he was granted a security clearance in 2003. The bankruptcy was alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
 
 Applicant testified that his current financial problems began with his divorce in 
2010, which left him responsible for $40,000 in marital debts, including a home 
mortgage payment, and obligations to pay alimony and child support. The home went 
into foreclosure, but there is no outstanding deficiency on the loan. His wife remarried 
shortly after the divorce, and Applicant no longer is obligated to pay alimony, but he is 
paying $180 per two-week pay period in child support. After paying all his bills and living 
expenses, he has a net monthly remainder of $200 to $300. (Tr. 36.) 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

In an effort to pay his debts, Applicant made two $10,000 withdrawals from his 
retirement account in 2013. He neglected to have federal income tax deducted from the 
first withdrawal, resulting in a large federal tax debt. (Tr. 28-30.) In his SCA, he 
indicated that he failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2013, but his 
disclosure was inaccurate. He timely filed his income tax return, but he failed to request 
that income taxes be withheld on a withdrawal from his retirement account, and he did 
not report the withdrawal as income on his 2013 tax return. (GX 1 at 29-30; GX 3 at 4-5; 
Tr. 29-30.) He testified that he originally owed the IRS about $10,000, but the amount 
has been reduced by the diversion of his federal income tax refunds. (Tr.49.)  
 
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts, which are reflected in his credit bureau 
reports (CBRs) from September 2015 and May 2016 (GX4 and 5). The evidence 
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: debt to men’s clothing store charged off for $1,184 in August 
2015. Applicant settled this debt for $800 and made the final payment on the agreed 
amount in January 2017. (AX A.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: credit card account charged off for $705 in May 2015. Applicant 
received a settlement offer of $423 and paid it in March 2017. (AX D; AX G.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: judgment for $1,295 in rent and damage to apartment filed in 
August 2015. The judgment was satisfied in March 2017. (AX B.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: collection account for $12,762, closed in March 2012. Applicant 
presented evidence that this debt was included in his 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The 
account number on the bankruptcy list of unsecured creditors matches the CBR entry 
on the September 2015 CBR. (GX 4 at 9; AX F at 11.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: federal tax debt of $7,798 for tax year 2013. Applicant testified that 
he sent four $100 checks to the IRS in 2015, and each time he received a $100 check 
from the U.S. Treasury. (Tr. 49, 54.) When he submitted a personal financial statement 
to DOHA in response to financial interrogatories in July 2016, he listed a monthly $150 
payment to the IRS. (GX 3 at 11.) After the hearing, Applicant contacted the IRS and 
made a payment agreement providing for monthly $140 payments beginning in April 
2017. (GX 3 at 10.) 
 
 Applicant has been making regular payments on two credit-card accounts not 
alleged in the SOR. One has a credit limit of $500 and the payments are current. (AX 
C.) The second account was “maxed out” during his divorce and has a balance of about 
$9,900, and he has been making regular monthly payments of $200 to keep this 
account current. (AX E.)

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
 
5 
 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems are reflected in his CBRs, response to the SOR, 
and testimony at the hearing. The evidence is sufficient to establish the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not 
meeting financial obligations”). His failure to timely pay the tax due on the withdrawal 
from his retirement account establishes the second prong AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or 
fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required”). 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts were numerous, 
recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established. Applicant has encountered conditions largely beyond 
his control. His bankruptcy in 2001 occurred because he lost his job when his 
employer’s business failed. His most recent financial problems were the result of his 
marital breakup caused by his ex-wife’s infidelity. He has acted responsibly by 
maintaining contact with his creditors, making payment agreements, and resolving all 
the debts alleged in the SOR except for the IRS debt. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established for all the debts except the IRS debt. Applicant has had 
insufficient time to establish a track record of compliance with the IRS payment plan. 
AG ¶ 20(g) is not established for the same reason.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶¶ 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant 
eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
 Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He served honorably 
in the U.S. Navy and held a security clearance for many years. He has not yet resolved 
the federal tax debt, but a security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection 
procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
It ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not 
require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay 
the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the 
SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
May 21, 2008). He has a plan to resolve his tax debt and has taken a significant step 
toward resolving it. Based on his responsible actions to resolve his other debts, I am 
confident that he will comply with his newly negotiated payment plan for the IRS debt. 
  
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and comply with the 
federal tax laws. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is 
clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is granted.
