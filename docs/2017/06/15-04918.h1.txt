Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
by a history of reckless spending, which recently led him to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
to resolve a substantial amount of past-due debt. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 29, 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under the financial considerations and foreign influence guidelines.1 Applicant answered 
the SOR and requested a decision on the administrative (written) record (Answer). 
 
 On July 28, 2016, Department Counsel sent Applicant the Government’s written 
case, known as a file of relevant material (FORM). With the FORM, Department 
Counsel forwarded to Applicant eight exhibits (Items 1 – 8) that the Government offers 
                                                          
1 The CAF took this action under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The CAF 
presumably adjudicated this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, which were 
applicable for all security clearance cases falling under the rubric of the Directive between September 1, 
2006 and June 7, 2017.

for admission into the record. Department Counsel also moved in the FORM to 
withdraw the foreign influence allegation. The motion was granted unopposed. Applicant 
submitted a response to the FORM (Response), and offered four exhibits (Exhibits 1 – 
4) for admission.2 On June 1, 2017, I was assigned the case for decision. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
 On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence issued Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a “single, common adjudicative 
criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to 
classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.”3 The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (hereinafter “adjudicative guidelines” or “AG”), which are found 
in Appendix A to SEAD-4, are to be used in all security clearance decisions issued on or 
after June 8, 2017.4 Accordingly, I have applied the current version of the adjudicative 
guidelines.5 ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security clearance 
decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards). 
 
Evidentiary Ruling 
 
DOHA proceedings are designed to allow the parties to present a full, fair, and 
accurate record of an applicant’s security clearance eligibility.6 In order to achieve these 
goals, the Directive states that the federal rules of evidence “shall serve as a guide.”7 
Furthermore, the DOHA Appeal Board has stated that administrative judges should 
liberally apply the “technical rules of evidence,” and err on the side of admitting all 
relevant and reliable evidence.8  
 
The Directive, however, does contain one major exception to this evidentiary rule 
of inclusion. Specifically, pursuant to Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.20, a DOD 
                                                          
2 Administrative documents, including confirmation of Applicant’s continuing sponsorship for a clearance, 
were collectively marked and attached to the record as Appellate Exhibit I. 
 
3 SEAD-4, ¶ B, Purpose.  
 
4 SEAD-4, ¶ C, Applicability.  
 
5 Nonetheless, I have considered the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines and my ultimate 
decision in this case would have been the same. Specifically, under the previous version of the guidelines 
(PV-AG), disqualifying conditions PV-AG ¶¶ 19(a) – 19(c), and 19(e) would apply to the circumstances 
under consideration. For similar reasons noted herein, none of the mitigating conditions listed under PV-
AG ¶ 20 would fully apply and would be insufficient to mitigate the security concerns at issue. 
 
6 Directive, ¶¶ E3.1.19; E3.1.25. See also, ISCR Case No. 99-0477 (App. Bd. July 25, 2000) (overall 
purpose of industrial security clearance program is “a full and fair adjudication of cases on the merits.”)

8 ISCR Case No 03-21434 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007) (“the DOHA process encourages Judges to err 
on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record, and then to consider . . . what, if any, weight to 
give to that evidence.”). See also ISCR Case No. 14-06011 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (“The weight that a 
Judge assigns to evidence is a matter within his or her discretion.”).

personnel background report of investigation (“ROI”), including the summary of a 
person’s security clearance interview, is generally inadmissible.9 The danger posed by 
an unauthenticated interview summary, which an applicant has not affirmatively 
adopted,10 is self-evident. An investigator, whether intentionally or through sheer 
negligence, may incorrectly summarize the interview.11  
 
At the same time, the interview summary may contain accurate, reliable, and 
relevant information that an applicant will want considered (or, may assume a judge will 
consider in the absence of an objection).12 Accordingly, it is generally an applicant who 
holds the proverbial “key” as to the admissibility of the summary.13 An issue, however, 
arises when an applicant does not respond to the FORM or fails to affirmatively indicate 
that they are waiving their objection to the summary’s admission into evidence.   
 
DOHA administrative judges have treated such situations in two different ways. 
One set of judges excludes a summary unless an applicant explicitly waives the E3.1.20 
authentication requirement,14 while another group of judges admits the summary, 
finding that an applicant’s failure to raise an objection constitutes a waiver of the 
authentication rule.15 This split appears to only extend to those pro se applicants who 
                                                          
9 See also E.O. 10865, Section 5 (prohibiting “investigative reports” without authenticating witness); 
Directive, ¶ E3.1.22 (prohibiting a third-party statement adverse to an applicant on a controverted issue).

06218 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2011) (error not to admit or fully consider summary of clearance interview that 
applicant adopted as his own).

12 ISCR Case No. 15-05252 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2016) (judge erred in sua sponte excluding summary of 
clearance interview, because applicant was under impression the summary would be considered by the 
judge as she had not raised an objection to its admission).  
 
13 The Government can overcome an objection to the interview summary by authenticating it and 
establishing that it is otherwise admissible. See E3.1.20. Additionally, Department Counsel is not hand 
cuffed by an applicant’s election for a decision on the written record. Under the Directive, Department 
Counsel can convert such cases to hearing, where they can call an authenticating witness and present 
additional evidence, including through cross-examination. See E3.1.7. 
 
14 See e.g. ISCR Case No. 15-00262 at 2 (A.J. Leonard Feb. 15, 2017) (notwithstanding explicit warning 
in FORM to applicant that they could object to the interview summary, judge excluded the summary 
because “I am not persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond to the FORM, which is optional, 
equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement.”).  
 
15 See e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-05009 n.1 (A.J. Foreman Feb. 10, 2017) (“Department Counsel informed 
Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of [summary of clearance interview]; make 
corrections, additions, deletions, or updates; or object to the lack of authentication. I have treated his lack 
of response to the FORM as a waiver of any objections to [the summary].”).

elect a decision on the written record. The same concern that has led some judges to 
exclude interview summaries offered with a FORM does not appear to extend to pro se 
applicants who elect a hearing – whether or not such applicants are informed that they 
can object to a summary’s admission on authentication grounds. 
 
At least one Appeal Board member has expressed some reservation in finding 
that a pro se applicant, who elects a decision on the written record, waives the 
authentication requirement when he or she fails to respond to a FORM. See ISCR Case 
No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (AJ Ra’anan’s concurring opinion). 
Nevertheless, the Appeal Board in a recent unanimous decision held that a summary of 
a security clearance interview offered with a FORM was properly admitted by a judge 
where: (1) the pro se applicant did not raise an objection to the summary’s admission 
and (2) there was no indication the summary contained inaccurate information. ISCR 
Case No. 15-01807 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2017).16  
 
Here, as in ISCR Case No. 15-01807, Applicant was on clear notice that he could 
object to the admission of the interview summary, Item 8, or he could comment on the 
accuracy of the summary. Applicant elected the later option and challenged a specific 
portion of the summary, notably, that he told the investigator he was making 
approximately $400,000 while working overseas as a federal contractor.17 He submitted 
documentation to support his position as to his actual salary and income. I have 
considered Applicant’s Response and his exhibits in assessing the weight to extend to 
Item 8. In light of the preceding and the lack of objection by either party to the proffered 
exhibits, I have admitted them, to include Item 8, into the record.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant served in the U.S. military from 1986 to 2006, and thereafter has 
worked primarily as a federal contractor. He was offered a position by his sponsoring 
employer, a defense contractor, in approximately January 2016. He is applying to retain 
a security clearance that he was initially granted in the early 1990s.18  
 
In 1986, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army. His initial application for a security 
clearance was denied due to illegal drug involvement, namely, preservice drug 
(marijuana) use and enrollment in a military drug rehabilitation program. He was 
subsequently granted a security clearance by the Army in 1990 or 1991.19 
                                                          
16 See also ISCR Case No. 14-06781 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2016) (failure to raise an objection to an 
exhibit offered by the Government with the FORM waives it); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at n. 6 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 7, 2004) (“An applicant can waive his or her objection to the admissibility of evidence even though 
the Directive is silent on the matter of waiver.”); ISCR Case No. 08-12061 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2009) 
("Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they are expected to take timely, 
reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to 
protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.").

In the mid-1990s, Applicant was investigated by the military for his suspected 
involvement in the online distribution of child pornography while stationed at a U.S. base 
in Country X. Applicant denies he engaged in such conduct and states that he only 
shared adult material (“Penthouse-type” nude photographs of women) with other service 
members via an online bulletin board. His personal computer was seized by military 
investigators, and two images of suspected child pornography were found during a 
subsequent search of the computer.  
 
Applicant was represented by military defense counsel during the course of the 
ensuing criminal investigation. He states that he was not criminally charged nor 
otherwise disciplined by the military. He believes that a high-ranking U.S. Army officer, 
with whom Applicant shared photos with through the online bulletin board, was court-
martialed. After the investigation was completed, Applicant was allowed to continue to 
serve in the U.S. Army and retired after twenty years of honorable service in 2006.20 
 
In 2005, Applicant put $40,000 down and signed a contract with a builder to 
construct a home for his family. The newly built home was completed in 2006. Applicant 
financed the purchase price of the new home by taking equity out of his existing home 
and through mortgage loans. He planned to sell his previous home, but due to 
economic conditions was unable.  
 
A year after the home was completed, in 2007, Applicant accepted a position to 
work as a U.S. government contractor in Country X. He rented both his homes in the 
United States. He worked in Country X as a U.S. Government contractor for the next 
five years, from 2007 to 2012. Upon returning to the United States, Applicant kept 
working for his former employer until 2015, when he was laid off. He experienced a 
period of unemployment before being hired by his current employer in January 2016.21  
 
 Applicant claims he started experiencing financial trouble in 2008, in part, 
because his pay was reduced 22 His W-2 statements for 2007 and 2008 reflect earnings 
of approximately $118,000 and $300,000, respectively. His IRS account transcripts for 
2010 – 2014 reflect the following:23 
 
Year Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) (approximate) 
2010 $140,000 
                                                          
20 Item 8 at 6-7. Beyond the summary of the security clearance interview, no evidence was provided 
regarding the security clearance denial and the child pornography allegations. Applicant was provided a 
copy of the interview summary with the FORM and nowhere in his Response does he challenge the 
accuracy or reliability of this portion of the interview. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). I 
only considered these non-alleged matters in the context of the whole person. ISCR Case No. 14-00151

23 The information regarding Applicants earnings and AGI for 2007-2008 and 2010-2014 were taken from 
Exhibits 2 and 3. Evidence regarding Applicant’s 2009 income and other years was not provided.

2011 $115,000 
2012 $265,000

 In the summer of 2009, the tenant renting Applicant’s recently constructed home 
received orders from the military and moved out. Applicant was unable to re-rent the 
property, and was unable to afford the mortgages on both his homes. He requested a 
modification, but the lender denied the request citing to Applicant’s high debt-to-income 
ratio and that he was not using the property as his primary residence.  
 
Applicant also tried to sell the recently constructed home with no success. He fell 
behind on his mortgage payments and lender foreclosed on the property in 2010. 
Applicant submitted a 1099-C showing the cancellation of more than $550,000 owed on 
the first mortgage, and that the fair market value of the property was less than 
$420,000.24 Notwithstanding Applicant’s purported inability to pay his mortgage, he took 
numerous vacation trips to Europe and Asia between 2008 and 2013.25 
 
 In September 2014, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA), 
which initiated the current reinvestigation. He reported that his past-due credit card and 
other unsecured debt totaled about $50,000. He explained that “[m]y income has gone 
down by almost 80% since August of 2012. I have done my best to keep up with all my 
financial obligations but have had the most difficulty this past year. With my income 
having gone down so much, I have not been able to keep up with everything.”26 
Applicant’s IRS account transcripts reflect that his AGI for 2012 and 2013 was over 
$200,000 for both years.27 He did not report the foreclosure of his home on the SCA.28  
 
In December 2014, Applicant was interviewed by a security clearance 
investigator. Applicant discussed his financial problems, including the foreclosure, with 
the investigator. He attributed his financial problems to: (a) the recession, (b) reduction 
in pay, (c) reliance on credit cards to pay bills, and (d) the cost associated with his wife’s 
frequent travels to Country X to visit and care for her sick grandmother. Applicant told 
the investigator that he was in the process paying down his debts.29

28 He also did not report on the SCA the 1986 security clearance denied, nor that he had a $30,000 
outstanding judgment from 2007. See Item 5, Bankruptcy Petition, Schedule F (listing 2007 judgment). 
These failures to disclose were not alleged in the SOR and are only being considered in assessing 
mitigation, credibility, and conducting a whole-person assessment.  
 
29 Item 8 at 4-5. See also Item 7 (December 2014 credit report reflects numerous delinquent accounts).

 Two of Applicant’s overdue creditors filed lawsuits against him. A month before 
he was to appear in court to answer their claims, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy.30 Applicant’s August 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition reflects: 
 
 A savings account balance of $6.50.31 
 
 Luxury car purchases in 2012 and 2014, which debts he reaffirmed.32 
 
 Delinquent state and federal taxes totaling about $12,000.33 
 
 Unsecured debt totaling over $190,000. Applicant’s unsecured debt 
included delinquent credit cards, unpaid loans, an overdrawn checking 
account, a $30,000 judgment from 2007, and over $100,000 for a 
mortgage-related debt. Also, listed is another mortgage-related debt for 
an unknown amount.34 
 
 Monthly income of approximately $10,800 against monthly expenses of 
about $11,300, leaving a negative $450 monthly remainder. Applicant’s 
recurring expenses included $1,400 monthly payments for two luxury 
vehicles and an additional $3,000 a month for the feed and care of a 
horse and riding lessons for his daughter.35  
 
Applicant’s (dischargeable) debts were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
in November 2015. He used his severance pay to pay his past-due federal taxes in 
January 2016.36 He states in his Response that he has since sold the horse and no 
longer has that as an expense. He claims that his past financial problems were, in part, 
attributable to receiving raises and bonuses that “were so miniscule . . . they had no 
positive financial impact.”37

information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to 
authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2; SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions. The guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  
commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a 
fair and impartial decision. AG ¶ 2. 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts 
alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting 
“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a 
favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
Administrative Judges make certain that applicants: (a) receive fair notice of the 
issues, (b) have a reasonable opportunity to address those issues, and (c) are not 
subjected to unfair surprise. Directive, ¶ E3.1.10; ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). In deciding a case, a judge must resolve any doubt raised by the 
evidence in favor of the national security. AG ¶ 2(b). See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. Moreover, 
the Supreme Court has held that officials making “security clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of 
trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. 
Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may 
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions 
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .38  
 
Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial 
issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other 
                                                          
38 AG ¶ 18.

illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances 
giving rise to delinquent debt cast doubt upon a person’s judgment, self-control, and 
other qualities essential to protecting classified information.39 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered all the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, including the following pertinent ones: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts . . .; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive 
indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or 
of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators; 
 
AG ¶ 19(f): failure to . . . pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
as required; 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, . . . or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, . . .), and the individual acted 
responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial 
counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection process. Instead, an 
administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal 
financial obligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.40

40 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016).

Moreover, the resolution of past financial issues alone without evidence of true reform 
and rehabilitation is of limited probative value in the security clearance context.41  
 
Applicant claims that his financial problems were, in part, attributable to a lack of 
sufficient income. The record evidence, however, reflects that he earned $300,000 in 
2008, and his IRS account transcripts from 2010 to 2014 indicate an AGI totaling nearly 
$1,000,000. Despite having the financial means to pay his debts, Applicant repeatedly 
failed to meet his financial obligations. His August 2015 bankruptcy petition reflects that 
one of his many unpaid debts included a $30,000 judgment from 2007. The record 
evidence further reflects that instead of paying his debts Applicant took several vacation 
trips to Europe and Asia. He purchased two luxury vehicles shortly before filing for 
bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy documents show that he was living beyond his means. 
Of note, his bankruptcy petition reflects that his monthly expenses, which included 
paying for the feed and care of a horse and his daughter’s riding lessons, exceeded his 
income. No documentary evidence was submitted showing that Applicant currently 
manages his finances any differently than he has for the past decade. 
 
Additionally, Applicant only took action to address his past-due debts through 
bankruptcy after some of his creditors took legal action to enforce their claims against 
him. He was then able to discharge nearly $200,000 in delinquent debt that he had 
accrued over the years. 
 
I have taken into account that some matters largely beyond Applicant’s control 
negatively impacted his finances (short-term unemployment and cost associated with 
his wife’s frequent travel to care for a sick family member). Also, Applicant presumably 
received financial counseling through the bankruptcy process and paid his past-due 
federal tax debt. Nevertheless, the record evidence and Applicant’s statements 
throughout the security clearance process demonstrate that the real problem is not 
these issues largely beyond his control but, rather, Applicant’s reckless or irresponsible 
spending. His statements further reveal that he has yet to appreciate and accept his role 
in his past financial issues. He failed to show that similar security-significant issues are 
unlikely to recur.  
 
In short, the circumstances giving rise to Applicant’s past financial problems 
continue to raise serious concerns about his suitability. The above-enumerated 
disqualifying conditions fully apply and some of the listed mitigating conditions partially 
apply. Applicant’s financial circumstances continue to raise a security concern.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 An administrative judge must make a commonsense judgment about a person’s 
security clearance suitability after considering all available, reliable and relevant 
                                                          
41 Compare, ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. July 3, 2014) (despite the presence of unresolved debt, 
notably, a second mortgage loan tied to a property that had been foreclosed, Board upheld grant because 
clear evidence of reform and rehabilitation), with, ISCR Case No. 15-03481 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016) 
(applicant’s filing of overdue tax returns alone insufficient to mitigate security concerns, where no 
extenuating circumstances to explain the late tax filing or evidence of financial reform).

information. This is referred to as the whole-person concept. (See generally AG ¶ 2. 
See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4.) A judge’s assessment in these cases is informed by the 
guidelines, as well as the non-exclusive factors set forth in AG ¶¶ 2(d) and 2(f). I hereby 
incorporate my above analysis and highlight some additional whole-person factors.  
 
 Applicant served honorably in the military for 20 years and thereafter has 
supported the U.S. Government as a contractor to the present day. However, this and 
the other favorable record evidence are insufficient to outweigh the serious security 
concerns (and negative inferences regarding his suitability) raised by Applicant’s long 
track record of failing to meet his financial obligations. Additionally, his lack of candor 
during the course of the security clearance process regarding the actual state of his 
finances further detracts from the favorable evidence. Of note, Applicant’s 2015 
bankruptcy petition reflects that his past-due unsecured debt alone totaled nearly 
$200,000 or four times the amount he reported a year earlier in a security clearance 
application. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility for continued access to classified information.42 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:        Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):       WITHDRAWN 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:          Withdrawn 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly 
consistent with the interest of national security to continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.

42 I considered the exceptions listed in Appendix C to SEAD-4, and do not find that any are warranted in 
this case. See SEAD-4, ¶ E.3 and AG ¶ 2(h); contrast with ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 
28, 2011) (under previous version of the guidelines, judges had “no authority to grant an interim, 
conditional or probationary clearance.”)
