HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges, and the record establishes: a 
federal tax lien filed in January 2015 for $30,677; unfiled federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2011 and 2012; child support arrearage of $16,565; and several debts placed 
for collection. He did not provide sufficient evidence of resolution of financial issues, and 
financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 17, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Item 3) On 
June 16, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information, which became effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 
AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
 
2 
                                         
 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On September 6, 2016, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he 
requested a decision without a hearing. (Item 2) On September 23, 2016, Department 
Counsel completed the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On October 3, 2016, Applicant 
received the FORM. On October 10 and 24, 2016, Applicant responded to the FORM. On 
June 7, 2017, the case was assigned to me. The case file consists of six exhibits. (Items 
1-5 and FORM response) Applicant did not object to any of the Government exhibits. 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs) which he made applicable to all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for 
all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.f, 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n. (Item 2) He also made some partial admissions, and he provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact. Additional findings of fact follow. 
 
Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been employed in information technology for 
federal government contractors since September 2012.3 In 1985, he graduated from high 
school. He attended college for three years; however, he did not receive a degree. He 
was unemployed for three months in 2012 and two months in 2010. From 1985 to 2009, 
he served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, and he honorably retired as a master 
sergeant/first sergeant (E-8). In 1991, he married, and in 2011, he divorced. His eight 
children were born in 1985, 1986, 1992, 1995, 1996, 2006, 2006, and 2012. There is no 
evidence that he violated security rules or used illegal drugs.  
 
  
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. 
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s February 
17, 2015 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). (Item 3)

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s March 17, 2015 and March 10, 2016 credit reports are the basis for the 
allegations in the SOR. His SOR describes the following negative financial information 
pertaining to federal income taxes: 1.a is a federal tax lien issued in January 2015 for 
$30,677, and 1.n indicates he failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 
2011 and 2012. 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists the following delinquent debts placed for collection: 1.b is a 
debt for $121; 1.c is a utilities debt for $277; 1.d is a cable debt for $163; 1.e is a 
telecommunications debt for $386; 1.f is a child support debt for $16,565; 1.g is a bank 
debt for $1,639; 1.h is a utilities debt for $162; 1.i is a debt for $299; 1.j is a credit card 
debt for $3,327; 1.k is a telecommunications debt for $1,530; 1.l is an insurance debt for 
$134; and 1.m is a debt for $579. 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant made brief comments about each SOR allegation.  
He accepted responsibility for the $30,677 federal tax lien and did not indicate when or if 
he would attempt to start a payment plan. He said he would pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 
1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.m.  He said the child support debt in SOR ¶ 1.f was being paid 
out of his retirement pay. He believed he had settled the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 
and 1.l. He said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was “bogus.” He said he would gather the 
documents and file his federal tax returns for 2011 and 2012 within 10 days of the date 
he receives the necessary documentation.   
 
On October 10, 2016, Applicant responded to the FORM and stated as follows: he 
is making payment arrangements with the IRS to address the 1.a debt; he paid the debts 
in 1.b and 1.c; the 1.l debt will be paid by October 15, 2016; the 1.d debt will be paid by 
November 1, 2016; payment arrangements will be made to address the debts in 1.e, 1.k, 
and 1.m by November 1, 2016; he is making payments to the creditors in 1.f and 1.i; he 
is disputing the debts in 1.g and 1.j; the 1.h debt will be paid by November 15, 2016; and 
he will file his federal tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 by November 1, 2016.      
 
 Aside from Applicant’s uncorroborated statements, there is no documentary 
evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise 
resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.m. He did not describe financial counseling. 
The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed 
explanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. 
The FORM noted that Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to 
submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, 
or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional 
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination 
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
 
4 
                                         
 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
 
5 
                                         
 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required.  
 
 
6 
                                         
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports and SOR response. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5 and  
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
  
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
 
7 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
 None of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant disclosed some 
circumstances beyond his control which adversely affected his finances. He was 
unemployed for three months in 2012 and two months in 2010. He was divorced in 2011.   
 
Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 
2012. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.6 For purposes of this 
                                            
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .

decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns 
against him as a federal crime. He did not receive notice of a Guideline J or E security 
concern in the SOR. 
 
The record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file two federal income tax 
returns. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
                                            
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
9 
                                         
 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when the tax returns were filed in ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance, “By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted 
access to classified information.” ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(citations omitted).  
 
In January 2015, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $30,677, and 
he has a child support arrearage of $16,565. He has several other delinquent SOR debts. 
Applicant did not provide enough details with documentary corroboration about what he 
did to address his SOR debts. He did not provide documentation relating to any of the 
SOR debts: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of 
checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the 
creditors; (2) correspondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of 
contact;7 (3) credible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for 
the debts and why he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate 
payment plans, such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting 
to resolve these debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to 
establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to 
substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. 
   
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress resolving his tax debt and the other SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance 
that his financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the 
future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial considerations 
security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                            
7 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is

     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 51 years old, and he has been employed in information technology for 
federal government contractors since September 2012. He was unemployed for three 
months in 2012 and two months in 2010. From 1985 to 2009, he served on active duty 
with the U.S. Marine Corps, and he honorably retired as a master sergeant/first sergeant. 
In 2011, he divorced, and he has eight children. His finances were adversely affected by 
unemployment and divorce. He did not provide specific details about how these 
circumstances beyond his control negatively affected his finances. There is no evidence 
that he violated security rules or used illegal drugs.   
 
Applicant did not provide proof that he filed his federal tax returns for 2011 and 
2012.8 In January 2015, the IRS filed a federal tax lien for $30,677, and Applicant has 
not agreed to a payment plan to address this tax debt. See AG ¶ 20(g).    
                                            
8The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security and trustworthiness concerns arising from 
tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of 
security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then 
taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has 
rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of 
someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond 
applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of 
Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-
05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, 
and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-
05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-
9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal 
returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts 
except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual 
income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s 
medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in 
the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem 
with complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules 
and systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-
03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the 
federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government 
for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has 
a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”). 
The Director of National Intelligence’s decision to issue AG ¶ 20(g) establishes mitigation for those who 
have made and complied with a tax payment plan; and this new AG must be considered for decisions 
issued after June 8, 2017.   
 
11 
                                         
 
Applicant provided insufficient corroborating or substantiating documentary 
evidence of payments and established payment plans for his SOR debts. He did not 
provide a detailed plan about how he intended to resolve all of his delinquent SOR debts. 
His actions show lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated 
questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 18. More documented information about inability to pay debts, 
financial history, or documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security 
concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able 
to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this 
time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.n:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
