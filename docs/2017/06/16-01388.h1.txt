GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 28, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on October 28, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 
2017, scheduling the hearing for May 10, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  
 
2 
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. The Government’s amendment to the SOR, November 2016 discovery letter, 
exhibit list, and demonstrative exhibit were appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits 
(HE) 1 through 4. Applicant testified at the hearing. At Applicant’s request and with no 
objection from the Government, I left the record open until May 31, 2017. Applicant 
timely provided documentation that I admitted as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through K 
without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 22, 2017.  
 
Procedural Rulings 
 
Amendment to the SOR 
 
 The Government moved to amend the SOR pursuant to ¶ E3.1.17 of the 
Directive, to withdraw duplicate allegations. Without objection, I granted the motion and 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.i, and 1.o were stricken because they are duplicates of SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.c, 
and 1.e, respectively.1  
 
New AG  
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG under the Directive.2 
Accordingly, I have applied the June 2017 AG.3 However, because the September 2006 
AG were in effect on the date of the hearing, I have also considered the September 
2006 AG. Having considered both versions of the AG, I conclude that my decision 
would have been the same had I applied the September 2006 AG. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since May 2015. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in physics in 
1981. He is married and has one minor child and two adult children, one of whom lives 
with Applicant.4  
 
 Applicant began working as a defense contractor and was first granted a DOD 
security clearance in 1985. When the contractor company merged with another, 
Applicant continued working for the new company until he was unexpectedly laid off in

2 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD-4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD-4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD-4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security AG, 
which are found at Appendix A to SEAD-4, apply to determine eligibility for initial or continued access to 
classified national security information. (SEAD-4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards).

January 2013, due to a government contract reduction. Applicant’s attempts to obtain 
another job were hindered by the federal government shutdown. Applicant was 
unemployed until March 2014, when he obtained employment with another defense 
contractor. He was laid off again in October 2014, when the company went out of 
business. He was unemployed for five months until his current employer hired him.5 
 
The SOR alleges a total of $39,700 in financial indebtedness, consisting of three 
judgments and ten delinquent debts. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his 
response to the SOR. The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions 
and the credit reports from October 2015 and July 2016.6  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a delinquent medical debt for $352. Applicant stated he paid this 
debt online to a collection firm in early 2016. He did not provide documentation to 
corroborate his claim.7  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a store credit card charged off for $4,891. Applicant indicated he 
paid $25 monthly directly to the store through automatic draft since late 2014. An 
October 2014 letter from a collection agency for the store credit card indicates that 
Applicant’s post-dated check of $25 would be deposited later that month, September 
2014 was the date of last payment, and the outstanding balance was $5,041.8  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a delinquent store credit card for $3,495. It is only listed on the July 
2016 credit report, which reflects that this debt was placed for collection with Midland 
Funding LLC (Midland). Applicant stated he paid Midland $205 monthly through an 
electronic check since around early 2014, the balance was $1,200, and he expected to 
have the debt paid within a few months. A May 2017 letter from Midland for the store 
credit card indicates that Applicant made 10 payments of $205 between July 2016 and 
April 2017, and the outstanding balance was $1,233. Applicant stated that SOR ¶ 1.c is 
the only debt to Midland he had been paying, he did not believe he had any other 
outstanding debts with Midland, and he was unsure whether his payments of $205 
monthly to Midland encompassed any of the other Midland debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 
and 1.l.9  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a delinquent credit card for $1,300, placed for collection with 
Midland. It has a different account number than the Midland debt of SOR ¶ 1.c. In 
addition, while the underlying creditor for SOR ¶ 1.d is the same as the underlying 
creditor for SOR ¶ 1.g, both credit reports reflect that SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.g have different 
account numbers. In his SOR response, Applicant stated he had not yet resolved SOR

¶ 1.d. At hearing, Applicant stated he believed he paid it. He did not provide 
documentation to corroborate his claim.10  
  
Applicant believes SOR ¶ 1.e is a delinquent store credit card for $1,649, though 
Applicant could not recall for which store, placed for collection with Midland. It has a 
different account number than the Midland debts of SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. Applicant 
stated at hearing that he believed the debt of SOR ¶ 1.e included the judgment of SOR 
¶ 1.l.11  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g is a delinquent store account of $3,657 placed for collection. Applicant 
stated he made arrangements to pay $100 monthly to the collection agency for SOR ¶ 
1.g, and he made such payments through automatic draft since late 2014. A December 
2014 letter from the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.g reflects the underlying store creditor, and 
indicates that Applicant’s authorized payment of $100 would be debited from his bank 
account later that month.12 
 
As previously stated, while the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.g is the same as the 
underlying creditor of SOR ¶ 1.d, both credit reports reflect that SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.g 
have different collection agencies and account numbers. In addition, while the collection 
agency for SOR ¶ 1.g is the same as the collection agency that obtained the judgment 
of SOR ¶ 1.m, an October 2014 letter from the judgment creditor for SOR ¶ 1.m reflects 
that the original creditor is a different store than that of SOR ¶ 1.g.13  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h is a delinquent account for $1,924. Both credit reports reflect that 
Applicant is only an authorized user for SOR ¶ 1.h.14  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j is a delinquent account for $3,814. While SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.h have the 
same creditor, the credit reports reflect different account numbers, and SOR ¶ 1.j is 
listed as Applicant’s individual account. Applicant stated he believed the creditor had 
written off SOR ¶ 1.j. An IRS Form 1099-C, referencing the same creditor and account 
number as SOR ¶ 1.j, indicates that SOR ¶ 1.j was canceled in December 2015. 
Applicant stated he believed he accounted for the income imputed to him, as a result of 
the 1099-C, in an amendment to his 2015 tax returns.15  
 
SOR ¶ 1.k is a delinquent account for $2,265. Applicant stated he believed SOR 
¶¶ 1.k and 1.p are duplicate accounts because while the creditors are different, the

amounts owed are the same, and both debts involve one store credit card. Applicant 
stated he had been paying $150 monthly online to a law firm to resolve SOR ¶ 1.k, and 
he expected to have the debt paid in June 2017.16  
 
SOR ¶ 1.l is a $4,799 judgment rendered in favor of Midland against Applicant in 
October 2014. Applicant stated at hearing that he believed the judgment of SOR ¶ 1.l 
included the debt of SOR ¶ 1.e. Applicant indicated in his SOR response that he worked 
out an arrangement to pay $150 monthly towards SOR ¶ 1.l.17  
 
A May 2017 ledger from a law firm reflects that Applicant made 31 payments of 
$150 between August 2014 and May 2017, and a $300 payment in June 2015, for a 
total of $4,800, with a $65 balance due. This payment arrangement is similar to the 
arrangement Applicant described for SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l. The ledger also reflects 
Midland as the creditor. While Midland is not the creditor of SOR ¶ 1.k, it is the creditor 
of SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.l.18  
 
Applicant was summoned to appear in court in October 2014, for a $4,799 claim 
against Applicant by Midland. The summons reflects the same creditor for whom the law 
firm was collecting Applicant’s payments and the same amount of debt as the May 2017 
ledger. The summons also shows that Midland was the successor in interest for the 
same creditor as SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.k, and the same store for whom Applicant stated 
was the underlying creditor for SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l.19  
 
SOR ¶ 1.m is a $2,220 judgment for a store credit card entered against Applicant 
in October 2014. As previously noted, while the collection agency that obtained the 
judgment of SOR ¶ 1.m is the same as the collection agency for SOR ¶ 1.g, they have 
different underlying store creditors. Applicant stated he paid $220 monthly through 
automatic draft since 2015, but was unsure of the balance. An October 2014 letter from 
the creditor indicates that it would electronically debit $220 from Applicant’s account 
later that month, and the balance due was $2,220.20  
 
SOR ¶ 1.n is a $7,084 judgment for a credit card entered against Applicant in 
April 2014. Applicant provided documentation that he paid this debt in 2016.21 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p is a delinquent account for $2,265. As previously discussed, Applicant 
stated he believed SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.k are duplicate accounts because while the

creditors are different, the amounts owed are the same, and both debts involve one 
store credit card.22  
 
Since Applicant’s unexpected layoff in January 2013, unemployment until March 
2014, second layoff in October 2014, and unemployment until May 2015, Applicant has 
made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He has not incurred additional 
delinquent debts. He is current on his mortgage for the home he has lived in since 
December 1996. He stated that he also paid off his car loans, and AE A reflects that he 
did so for one car in October 2016. Applicant’s current annual income of approximately 
$122,700, not accounting for his wife’s annual income of approximately $60,000, is 
about what Applicant made prior to his first layoff. He also expects to start receiving his 
retirement income of $3,500 monthly in June 2017. While Applicant has unresolved 
SOR debts, Applicant’s track record of repayment demonstrates a commitment to 
continue resolving his remaining debts.23 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
                                                          
22 Tr. at 30-55; GEs 2-3. 
 
23 Tr. at 18-55; GEs 1-3; AE A. 
 
7 
 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations 
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. 
Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a 
possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as 
excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol 
abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater 
risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate 
funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. I find that SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.k are duplicates 
of SOR ¶ 1.l, and SOR ¶ 1.p is a duplicate of ¶ 1.k. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
 
8 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely  
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Since Applicant’s unexpected layoff in January 2013, unemployment until March 
2014, second layoff in October 2014, and unemployment until May 2015, Applicant has 
made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He paid SOR ¶ 1.n. He 
provided a 1099-C to show that he resolved SOR ¶ 1.j. He demonstrated a track record 
of payments for SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.l. He began paying SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.g, and 1.m. He is 
current on his mortgage for the home he has lived in since December 1996. He stated 
that he paid off his car loans, and demonstrated that he did so for one car in October 
2016. He has not incurred additional delinquent debts. While Applicant has unresolved 
SOR debts, Applicant has demonstrated a track record of repayment and has the 
means to continue to resolve his remaining debts. AG ¶¶ 20(a) to 20(c) are applicable. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
 
9 
 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant has unresolved SOR 
debts, there is sufficient evidence that Applicant is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     For Applicant 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.f, 1.i, 1.o:     Withdrawn 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.e, 1.g - 1.h, 1.j - 1.n, 1.p: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
