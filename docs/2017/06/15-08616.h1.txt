MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant is a longtime clearance holder who failed to file timely federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012. His spouse was very ill at the time. He 
filed his delinquent tax returns in October 2015 and has shown reform by filing his income 
tax returns for subsequent tax years on time. Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On June 16, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006.

On July 18, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). 
On October 28, 2016, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. On November 1, 2016, I scheduled a hearing for December 1, 
2016. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, at 
Department Counsel’s motion and with no objection from Applicant, the SOR was 
amended to accurately reflect the state to which Applicant was required to file income tax 
returns for 2011 and 2012. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and three Applicant 
exhibits (AEs A-C) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, as 
reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on December 13, 2016. 
 
I held the record open for one month for post-hearing submissions from Applicant. 
On December 20, 2016, Applicant submitted IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 
(AE D) and 2012 (AE E) and a letter from his state department of revenue (AE F). On 
December 21, 2016, the Government expressed no objection to their admissibility, so I 
accepted the records in evidence. On December 27, 2016, Applicant submitted a monthly 
budget, which was marked and admitted without objection as AE G on December 30, 2016. 
   
While this case was pending a decision, Security Executive Agent Directive 4 was 
issued establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered 
individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or 
eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AG supersede the adjudicative guidelines 
implemented in September 2006 and are effective for any adjudication made on or after 
June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have adjudicated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility 
under the new AG.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file 
federal (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) and state income tax returns (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) for tax 
years 2011 and 2012, and that Applicant owed a $272 charged-off debt (SOR ¶ 1.e) as of 
June 16, 2016. When he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had forgotten to 
file his federal and state income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 when they were due, but he 
indicated that his taxes have been filed and paid. Applicant denied the delinquent debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.e on the basis of payment.  
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old operations supervisor who has worked for a defense 
contractor since March 2004. (GE 1.) He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. 
                                                 
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in this 
case.

military from February 1984 until he retired in March 2004. Applicant held a top-secret 
security clearance for his military duties until 1991, when his clearance was downgraded to 
the secret level. (GE 2.) Applicant’s secret clearance was transferred to his defense-
contractor employment. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse married in July 1988. They have three grown children:  a 
daughter born in June 1987 who is married, and two sons born in August 1989 and 
February 1993. They have rented their current residence since July 2004. (GE 1.) 
 
In approximately November 2011, Applicant’s spouse began experiencing medical 
problems that led her to miss work on and off over the next 2.5 years. She was and 
continues to be employed as a para-professional for a local school system. After several 
visits to the emergency room, her illness was properly diagnosed in July 2013 and resolved 
through outpatient surgery. (Tr. 22-25.) His spouse had always prepared their income tax 
returns. Due to her illness and the stress it caused, neither Applicant nor his spouse filed 
their federal and state income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 when they were due. (GEs 1, 
2; Tr. 25-27.) When asked why he had not filed his delinquent returns for 2011 and 2012 in 
2014 given that his spouse’s medical issue had been resolved, Applicant responded that 
he completely forgot about them until he received a notice from the IRS that he owed taxes 
for 2011 and 2012. (Tr. 52.) IRS account transcripts show that the IRS issued a notice on 
February 11, 2013, for tax year 2011 (AE D) and on December 23, 2013, for tax year 2012. 
(AE E.) The IRS transcripts show no further notices or activity until October 2015, when 
Applicant filed the returns and paid the taxes, so it may be that Applicant learned of the tax 
debts in 2013. Applicant and his spouse filed their 2014 income tax returns in January or 
February 2015. (Tr. 52.) For 2015, they filed their federal return, if not also their state 
return, in February 2016. (AEs D, E.) 
 
 To renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified to the 
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on August 12, 2015.  
Applicant responded “Yes” to whether, in the past seven years, he had failed to file or pay 
federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. Applicant indicated that he 
had failed to file federal and state income tax returns or pay taxes for tax years 2011 and 
2012 because his spouse was ill. He reported the amount of the taxes as “$0.” Concerning 
any steps taken to satisfy the issue, Applicant responded that he would file and pay his 
taxes. In response to inquiries into any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant 
listed an $810 credit card debt that he settled in May 2015. (GE 1.) 
 
As of August 21, 2015, Applicant’s credit record continued to report as outstanding a 
$272 past-due debt that had been charged off in February 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.e). The debt 
information was from February 2010 on an automobile loan opened in July 2007. Applicant 
had satisfied in January 2012 a $1,244 judgment from November 2010. Three credit card 
debts in collection, including the $810 debt listed on his SF 86, had been settled between 
February 2015 and May 2015. Applicant was making timely payments on a credit card with 
a balance of $2,166 and on a car loan obtained in March 2015 for $30,663. However, he 
had been 30 days late  12 times, 60 days late seven times, and 90 days late 11 times in 
the past, including in May 2015, on the credit card account.  (GE 3.) 
4 
 
 
 On October 19, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Concerning his previously disclosed tax 
issues, Applicant expressed his intention to file his delinquent tax returns and pay his taxes 
for those tax years by October 29, 2015. Applicant was questioned about his settled credit 
card debts, which he indicated had become delinquent because he forgot to pay them. He 
indicated there would be no recurrence. As for the $272 past-due debt on his credit record, 
Applicant surmised that it was for a car loan, but he could not recall any details. (GE 2.) 
Applicant filed a dispute with the creditor, who confirmed on July 14, 2016, that his account 
history was being reported inaccurately. (AE A.) Applicant testified that he had satisfied his 
loan in full. He had no explanation for why the debt had been reported as delinquent. (Tr. 
39.) 
 
 On October 20, 2015, a professional tax service finished preparing Applicant and his 
spouse’s delinquent federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012.2 On 
adjusted joint gross income of $104,149 for 2011, they owed federal income taxes of 
$2,707 and state income taxes of $739. (AE B.) On adjusted gross income of $109,188 for 
2012, they owed federal income taxes of $1,416 and state income taxes of $510. (AE C.) 
The IRS received the tax returns for 2011 and 2012 on October 26, 2015. Applicant paid 
the taxes owed the IRS when he submitted his delinquent returns. In December 2015 and 
February 2016, the IRS assessed penalties and interest totaling $1,569 for paying and 
filing late for tax year 2011 and $678 for tax year 2012. The IRS applied funds due to be 
refunded to them for tax year 2015 to satisfy their federal tax debts for 2011 and 2012. 
(AEs D, E.) Applicant’s state tax liabilities were satisfied by the state intercepting his tax 
refund for tax year 2015 and by garnishing his wages for two pay periods. (Tr. 30-36.) By 
letter dated December 14, 2016, the state’s tax authority confirmed that the returns for tax 
year 2011 and 2012 have been filed and that all taxes reported due have been paid. (AE 
F.) 
 
 Applicant borrowed $25,000 from his retirement account at work in 2015 to pay 
some debts. He is repaying the loan at $230 every two weeks. (Tr. 53.) 
 
 Applicant and his spouse’s household budget reflects net monthly discretionary 
income of $1,013 after including his retirement pay of $1,300 and the following expenses:  
$780 for miscellaneous bills; $800 for groceries; $1,310 for rent; $154 in credit card 
payments; $180 for oil heat and $300 for electricity; $240 for gasoline and $723 in a car 
payment; $100 for clothing; and $300 for unspecified expenses. (AE G.) Applicant 
estimated at his hearing that he and his spouse had only $200 or $300 in discretionary 
funds at the end of each month. Apparently, they rent to own furniture at a cost of $400 a 
month. (Tr. 45-46.) They also pay $200 a month for car insurance. (Tr. 47) It is unclear 
whether those expenses are included in the $780 budgeted for bills or the $300 for “other” 
expenses. 
 
                                                 
2 Applicant testified that he started gathering his paperwork to file his delinquent tax returns in approximately 
March 2015. (Tr. 52.) AEs B and C contain W-2 information from Applicant that was printed out in April 2015, 
so it appears that he was gathering information needed to prepare his taxes before October 2015. 
5 
 
 Applicant had only about $10 in checking account deposits and $5 in savings as of 
late November 2016. (Tr. 45.) When asked about his history of late payments on the credit 
card with the largest balance, he responded, “I’ve really been trying to pay them on time. I 
am doing my best.” He had car problems in the past which stressed his finances. (Tr. 50-
51.) Applicant has had no financial counseling. He did not believe that he needed it, 
although he testified that he was “starting to think [he does need counseling].” (Tr. 59.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated 
by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security 
concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance 
misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by 
known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result 
from criminal activity, including espionage. 
 
 Applicant candidly acknowledged on his August 2015 SF 86 that he had yet to file 
his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012. He reported his tax 
debt as zero for each tax year. However, Applicant and his spouse’s joint belated returns 
show that they underpaid their federal income taxes by $2,707 and their state income taxes 
by $739 for 2011. For 2012, they underpaid their federal taxes by $1,416 and their state 
income taxes by $510. Disqualifying condition AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” applies in that he had not paid the taxes when they were due. Of 
primary security concern in this case is Applicant’s failure to comply with his income tax 
filing obligation, which triggers AG ¶ 19(f), “failure to file or fraudulently filing annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax as required.” 
 
 The Government relies on a credit report to establish that Applicant owed a past-due 
balance of $272 on an old auto loan as of June 2016 as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. In ISCR 
Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
  
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the 
debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
Applicant disputed the debt with the creditor, contending that he paid the automobile loan 
in full. In a letter dated July 14, 2016, the creditor confirmed that Applicant’s account 
history was reported inaccurately and that it had submitted a request to the credit bureaus 
to adjust the reporting of the account. AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
7 
 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue,” is established with respect to the alleged debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. 
 
 Concerning the income tax filing and payments issues, the late filing appears to 
have been aberrational and caused by circumstances that are not likely to recur. See AG ¶ 
(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Applicant’s spouse handled their income tax 
returns, and when she became ill, neither she nor Applicant complied with this important 
legal obligation. However, since her condition resolved, they have filed their income tax 
returns on time. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) has some applicability in that his spouse’s illness was an unexpected 
circumstance. AG ¶ 20(b) provides: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Yet, AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that an individual act responsibly. In that regard, Applicant 
managed to report to work on those occasions when he was not accompanying his spouse 
to her medical appointments. Even if I accept that he was too stressed or distracted to 
focus on their tax obligations when his spouse was ill, she was successfully treated in July 
2013 and yet he made no attempt to file their delinquent income tax returns in 2014. He 
should have been reminded in early 2014 when they filed their 2013 returns that they had 
yet to file their 2011 and 2012 returns. It is difficult to believe that he would have forgotten 
about those returns. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from 
a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there 
are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” has only partial 
applicability in that the delinquent tax returns have been filed and the taxes paid. Applicant 
has shown some difficulty managing his financial affairs responsibly. Although not alleged, 
the evidence shows that he has a history of chronically late payments on a credit card debt, 
and settled other credit card debts only after they went to collections.3 As recently as 2015, 
he borrowed $25,000 from his 401(k) to pay some debts. He has had no financial 
counseling, although he now believes that he could benefit from such counseling. 
 
                                                 
3 The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 
2012). Applicant’s handling of his financial affairs generally is relevant in the whole-person evaluation. 
8 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” and AG ¶ 20(g), “the individual has made 
arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in 
compliance with those arrangements,” which pertains to tax issues specifically, are partially 
satisfied for the same reasons. Applicant began collecting the information needed to file his 
delinquent returns around March or April 2015, albeit after the IRS had notified him that he 
owed taxes for 2011 and 2012. He retained a professional tax service to prepare his and 
his spouse’s delinquent returns, and he submitted them shortly after they were prepared in 
October 2015. He submitted payment of their federal taxes with the returns. Penalties and 
interest assessed in December 2015 were paid in February 2016, when the IRS applied 
some of their tax refund for 2015. 
 
 Regarding his and his spouse’s delinquent state returns for tax years 2011 and 
2012, Applicant satisfied AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(g) in part in that he filed the returns in 
October 2015. Tax debts of $739 for 2011 and $510 for 2012 were not paid with the 
returns. The state seized their tax refund for 2015 for the debts and then garnished his 
wages for the rest. Both AG ¶ 20(d) and AG ¶ 20(g) require some voluntary conduct on the 
part of the individual to initiate or arrange for repayment, and interception of tax refunds 
and garnishment by the tax authority would not qualify. The garnishment appears to have 
been involuntary. 
 
 Even where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to 
prevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from 
considering an applicant’s trustworthiness in light of prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). Applicant 
has demonstrated that he is likely to file his income tax returns on time in the future. There 
is no evidence that his returns for tax years 2013 through 2015 were filed late. Applicant 
testified, and IRS account transcripts appear to corroborate, that he filed his federal income 
tax returns for tax year 2015 in February 2016. His financial situation is of some concern. 
He had to borrow against his retirement to pay some debts in 2015. He testified to having 
net discretionary income of $200 to $300 each month while his household budget 
submitted after his hearing shows $1,013 in excess income. The discrepancy in budget 
figures and lack of available funds makes it difficult to assess his financial stability. He had 
no savings and only $5 in checking deposits as of early December 2016, which would 
suggest spending or financial support not accounted for in his budget. The credit report of 
record is not sufficiently recent to enable a good assessment of Applicant’s current 
financial situation. While it reveals a history of late payments on some accounts, it shows 
that Applicant settled his past-due debts in 2015 before he completed his SF 86 to renew 
his security clearance. Applicant could benefit from some financial counseling, but he has 
taken responsibility for addressing his legitimate obligations. The financial considerations 
security concerns are adequately mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
In assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of 
an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
9 
 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(d).4 The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant demonstrated poor judgment in failing to comply with his income tax filing 
and tax payment obligations for two years. His spouse’s medical problems notwithstanding, 
he certainly was not prevented from seeking professional assistance to file their returns 
when his spouse was unable to handle them. The Appeal Board has long held that the 
failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-established 
government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 
2016); ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).It is well settled that once a 
concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong 
presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990.) 
 
 Yet security clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past 
transgressions. The security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant’s 
current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the 
Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Concerns that Applicant 
may not comply with government rules are allayed in that he has held a security clearance 
for years without any evidence of security violations. Also in his favor, he began gathering 
documentation to file his delinquent returns before he completed his SF 86, candidly 
disclosed his tax problems on his SF 86, and filed his delinquent income tax returns by 
October 29, 2015, as he had promised during his interview with the OPM investigator. I 
conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant’s security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  For Applicant 
                                                 
4 The factors under AG ¶ 2(d) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
