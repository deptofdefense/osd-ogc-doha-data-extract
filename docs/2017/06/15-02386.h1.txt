MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 29, 
2012. On October 21, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 24, 2015, and requested a decision 
on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s 
written case on March 7, 2016 and sent a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. He was 
given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or 
 
2 
 
mitigate the Government’s evidence. He received the FORM on April 26, 2016, and 
timely submitted his response on May 20, 2016, to which the Government did not 
object. Applicant included seven attachments with his FORM response that I have 
marked as Applicant Exhibits (AX) 1 through 7. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the 
case. Items 3 through 6 and AX 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence. The case was 
assigned to me on March 20, 2017. On May 17, 2017, I emailed the parties to reopen 
the record in order to afford Applicant the opportunity to provide an updated FORM 
response. That email has been marked as Appellate Exhibit I. Applicant timely 
submitted additional information and documents that I admitted into evidence, without 
objection, as AX 8 through 14.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant is 41 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He 
received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1997. Applicant began experiencing financial 
difficulties in 2008. He attributes his delinquent debts to periods of either unemployment 
or underemployment that affected his ability to pay his mortgage and other debts.  
 
From 2004 through 2009, Applicant worked as a security guard for federal 
contractors. In 2009, he transitioned to the information-technology field where he has 
worked primarily for federal contractors. Applicant reported the following periods of 
unemployment in his 2012 SCA: July 2009 through November 2009; September 2010 
through October 2010; March 2011 through May 2011; and February 2012 through July 
2012. Applicant was fired in July 2009 and March 2011. He denies any wrongdoing in 
each instance.   
 
In November 2012, Applicant was unemployed and receiving employment 
benefits, but had a pending offer of employment contingent on obtaining a security 
clearance. He remains sponsored by that federal contractor. The record is silent as to 
his employment status from that point through approximately March 2017. Since at least 
March 2017, Applicant has been employed by two other employers. The DOD 
previously granted Applicant security clearances in approximately 2003 and 2010.2 
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file and pay federal income taxes, as 
required, in tax year 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition in 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.i.). It also alleges 11 delinquent debts, including mortgage and 
state tax debt, totaling $176,518 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.h, 1.j – 1.m).3 Applicant denied each 
                                                          
1 These facts are extracted from Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 2), his SCA (Item 3), and the summary of 
his clearance interview (Item 4). I considered that Item 4 was not authenticated as required by Directive ¶ 
E3.1.20. However, Applicant was informed by Department Counsel that he was entitled to make 
corrections, additions, deletions, and updates to Item 4. Applicant was also informed that he was entitled 
to object to consideration of Item 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant did neither in his 
response to the FORM, or his supplemental FORM submission.

of the 13 SOR allegations on the basis that the debts were either resolved or being 
resolved.  
 
Because he did not have the funds to pay the taxes that he owed, Applicant did 
not timely file his 2010 state income tax returns or his 2011 federal and state income tax 
returns. On an unspecified date prior to November 2012, he filed his 2010 and 2011 
state returns, and paid the $65 that he owed for both years. In 2013, he filed his 2011 
federal return and received a refund of $412 from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).4  
 
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant incurred additional federal income tax 
debt totaling $3,225 from tax years 2012 through 2014, and state tax debt totaling 
$6,200 for delinquent income and property tax debt from an unspecified period after tax 
year 2011.5 In April 2016, he established installment agreements to pay both debts: the 
IRS $50 per month beginning June 2016, and the state $88 per month beginning May 
2016.6  
 
The 2016 IRS agreement never went into effect because Applicant failed to 
submit a form that he says the IRS never provided to him.7 In March 2017, Applicant 
established another installment agreement to pay the IRS $50 per month for tax year 
2014, without addressing the status of his 2012 balance, if any.8 Applicant paid $500 to 
the IRS on May 22, 2017,9 and stated that the IRS applied his federal income tax refund 
of $929 to pay his IRS tax debt.10 He made at least two payments of $116 each to the 
state, one in March 2017 and the other in April 2017, and stated that he has otherwise 
been timely with his payments pursuant to the 2016 state agreement.11 
 
Applicant completed a seven-month certification program at a university in 
November 2006. He also took classes at another university from August 2005 through 
November 2011. He took out student loans for both. The record is not entirely clear as 
to the total amount of his outstanding student loans, including those in deferment status. 
                                                          
4 See also AX 2. I considered that Applicant estimated that he owed state and federal taxes for tax years 
2010 and 2011 totaling approximately $4,700 on his September 2012 eQIP, which apparently served as 
the basis for the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. However, during his November 2012 clearance interview, he 
provided the actual amounts. He paid a total of $65 for his 2010 and 2011 state taxes, and received a 
$412 refund of his 2011 federal taxes.

mitigation and whole person.

However, at least two of them became delinquent in the total approximate amount of 
$4,090 (SOR ¶ 1.g and 1.j).  
 
In March 2016, Applicant was accepted into a rehabilitation program to pay the 
student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g ($1,958).12 He met the obligations of that program in 
January 2017.13 In March 2017, Applicant enrolled in an auto-pay program with a new 
lender to pay $30 per month to satisfy the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, which he timely 
paid in March and April 2017.14 Applicant stated that he made payment arrangements to 
pay the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j ($2,132) as of November 2015. However, he did not 
provide documents corroborating either the agreement or any payments made. 
 
Applicant purchased a condominium in June 2007 for $304,600, which he 
financed with a mortgage loan. Due to unemployment, Applicant fell behind in his 
mortgage payments. By October 2012, his lender had initiated foreclosure 
proceedings.15 As of February 2015, Applicant had been 120 days or more past due on 
his monthly payments in the approximate amount of $148,093 (SOR ¶ 1.c), with a 
remaining loan balance of $298,476.16 Applicant attempted unsuccessfully to modify his 
mortgage loan on at least ten occasions. Applicant also fell behind on paying his 
condominium association fees, for which his creditor obtained three judgments against 
him in 2010, 2013, and 2014 totaling $12,679 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.f).17 
 
Applicant was delinquent in his payments for two credit-card accounts totaling 
$6,359 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.l), a $257 medical account (SOR ¶ 1.k), and a $340 gym-
membership account (SOR ¶ 1.m). His medical debt resulted from charges not covered 
by his health insurance.  
 
On a date not specified in the record, Applicant filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition to avoid a foreclosure action on his condominium and address his other 
delinquent debts. Because it was not feasible, on another date not specified in the 
record, the case was converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy.18 His bankruptcy debts,

18 AX 1 and 7. I considered that AX 1 contains a copy of an unsigned Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition dated 
November 2015, while AX 7 contains a discharge order dated September 2015.  Both documents contain 
the same case number. AX 7 also contains a copy of a November 2015 letter prepared by Applicant’s 
bankruptcy attorney confirming the discharge. I do not find that the discrepancy as to the date of the 
petition materially alters the relevant facts, as the petition was likely printed by the attorney along with the 
letter he prepared.

including those alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f, 1.h, and 1.k through 1.m, were 
discharged in September 2015.  His tax and student loan debts were not discharged. 
 
 As of April 2017, there remained a balance of $4,653 in Applicant’s checking 
account; and $4,867, as of May 2017.19 Applicant has not incurred any new delinquent 
debt since 2014. While the record does specifically address it, I conclude that Applicant 
likely completed the financial counseling typically required during the course of his 
bankruptcy.  
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”20 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”21 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”22 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”23 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met

the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.24 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”25 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.26 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.27 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.28 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”29 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”30 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified

information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.31  
 
Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit bureau reports, establish three 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 
19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same”). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file and pay federal income taxes, as 
required, in tax year 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and owed state taxes of $4,700 for tax years 
2010 through 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b). Prior to issuance of the SOR, the Applicant received a 
refund after he filed his 2011 federal tax returns late, and paid his 2010 and 2011 state 
taxes late in an amount that totaled $65 and not $4,700. Moreover, Applicant incurred 
state and federal tax debts for additional tax years not alleged. 
 
 Whether or not Applicant could afford to pay his federal and state taxes, he was 
required to timely file his federal and state tax returns. Therefore, his failure to timely file 
his 2010 state return and his 2011 state and federal returns and to timely pay any 
associated taxes owed raise potential concerns about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Before his November 2012 clearance interview, he filed and paid his 
2010 and 2011 state returns and taxes. Before the issuance of his October 2015 SOR, 
he received a refund after filing his 2011 federal return in 2013. He incurred additional 
federal and state tax debts for years after 2011 that were not alleged in the SOR. 
Applicant not only resolved his 2010 and 2011 tax issues well before issuance of the 
                                                          
31 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).

SOR, but he has now also established a reasonable plan to pay his unalleged federal 
and state tax debts. Considering the facts and the circumstances under which the tax 
debts occurred and the fact that they have now been or are being resolved, I conclude 
that Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Moreover, his 
unalleged tax debts do not pose any additional security concerns.   
 
Applicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c – 1.f, 1.h, and 1.k – 1.m 
through bankruptcy, which is an acceptable form of debt resolution. He is in the process 
of resolving the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.j. Accordingly, I conclude that 
Applicant has mitigated the concerns alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.m.  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is established. Applicant made substantial progress in addressing his 
delinquent debts. While he is not currently debt-free, his finances do not cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.32  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is established. Applicant’s loss of employment and underemployment 
were circumstances that were unexpected and beyond his control. Since then, he has 
acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) is established. Applicant likely received financial counseling during his 
bankruptcy proceedings. He is in the process of resolving his student loan debts and his 
unalleged state and federal tax debts. Given the circumstances under which he incurred 
them and the reasonable steps that he has taken to pay or otherwise resolve them, I 
conclude that his financial problems are now under control. Applicant’s actions, both 
before and after the issuance of his SOR, demonstrate that he will follow through with 
the agreements that he established to pay his remaining delinquent debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Applicant has made good-faith efforts to address his 
SOR debt and his unalleged tax debts. Before the SOR was issued, after numerous 
unsuccessful attempts to work with his lender to modify his home mortgage loan, 
Applicant resolved eight of the 11 debts alleged in the SOR (including his home 
mortgage loan) through a bankruptcy discharge. Applicant not only established payment 
agreements to pay his unalleged state and federal tax debts and the student loan debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, but also made payments to each creditor. I find that Applicant 
articulated a reasonable plan to resolve the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j despite his failure 
to produce a copy of the agreement or payments made pursuant thereto.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
                                                          
32 ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by “concomitant 
conduct” that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan).  
 
 
9 
 
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(a). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his financial indebtedness, and by his failure to timely file his income 
tax returns and pay his income taxes. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of 
showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for 
access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.m: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted.
