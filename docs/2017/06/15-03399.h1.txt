KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial 
history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on February 13, 2013. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On February 17, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
2 
 
in a civil court case. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security 
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR 
on March 15, 2016, and requested a decision based on the written record without a 
hearing.   
 
On May 31, 2016, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on that same day. He was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on June 22, 2016.3 Applicant did 
not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 4, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Included in the FORM were six items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits 1 through 5.4 Exhibits 1, and 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. 
Exhibit 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took 
place during the April 2013 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated, as 
required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s written brief includes a 
footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to 
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. Nevertheless, I am not 
persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond to the FORM, which response is 
optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement. 
The record does not demonstrate that Applicant understood the concepts of 
authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not demonstrate that he understood 
the implications of waiving an objection to the admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 
2 is inadmissible, and I have not considered the information in the ROI.    
 
 
 
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in the 
Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated June 8, 2016, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated June 22, 2016. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 
days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR and Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and the Answer are the 
pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 2 through 6 are marked as Exhibits 1 through 
5.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 53 years old and a high school graduate. He is married and has one 
adult daughter. Since October of 1983, he has been employed by a defense contractor.6 
 
 The SOR alleged a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition filed in June 2010 and 
dismissed in 2011, and 13 delinquent debts totaling $30,224.7 Applicant admitted the 
bankruptcy allegation and six of the delinquent debts totaling $22,348.8 He denied seven 
of the delinquent debts totaling $7,876.9 Applicant did not provide any documentation to 
support his denials. Except for one denied SOR debt,10 there is record evidence to 
support the debts that Applicant denied.11 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.12 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”13 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.14 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.15

security clearance).

 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.16 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.17 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.18 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.19 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.20 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,22 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information.23 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors:

22 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
23 AG ¶ 18. 
 
5 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). Applicant has 
produced no documentation to support his answers to the SOR debts. In fact, the 
evidence is contrary to his answers. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that 
applicants must present documentation to support their claims that debts have been 
resolved.24 I conclude that none of the Guideline F mitigating conditions apply.  
 
 The record creates doubt about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.25 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l & n:              Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.m:         For Applicant  
 
                                                          
24 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008) (it is reasonable for a judge to expect 
an applicant to present documentation about the satisfaction or other resolution of individual debts); ISCR 
Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). 
 
25 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)-(9).

Conclusion 
 
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
