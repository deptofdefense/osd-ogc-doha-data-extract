MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 25, 2014. On 
December 23, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on January 21, 2016,1 and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 16, 
2016, and the case was assigned to me on February 2, 2017. On February 9, 2017, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for March 7, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence, without objection. I appended 
                                                          
1 I considered that the answer is actually dated January 21, 2015, but given the record facts, I find that it 
is a typographical error.

Government’s exhibit list to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open 
to April 5, 2017. Applicant timely provided additional documents that I admitted into 
evidence as AE J through Q, without objection. I appended the associated post-hearing 
email exchanges to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) II. DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on March 20, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant, age 33, was married in January 2015.3 He has an eight-year-old son, 
who lives primarily with his mother in Colorado. Since 2013, he has shared a home with 
his wife, and her two daughters, mother, brother, and nephew; and his son when he is 
visiting.4 He honorably served in the U.S. Air Force from 2004 through 2010. He 
received a technical degree in motorcycle repair in 2008, and has taken college courses 
in pursuit of an associate’s degree. Since February 2013, he has been employed as an 
aircraft mechanic with the same defense contractor with whom he was previously 
employed between July 2010 and May 2011. He currently maintains a security 
clearance. 
 
In May 2011, Applicant relocated from state A to state B to be closer to his son 
who was living there at the time. While in state B, Applicant was underemployed and 
then became unemployed from October 2012 through February 2013. He was not 
eligible for unemployment compensation because he was fired by his employer.5 He 
resided in state B until December 2012 when he returned to state A to resume 
employment with his current employer. His scheduled start date of December 2012 was 
delayed to February 2013 due to security-clearance processing. He received a housing 
allowance of approximately $1,000 per month while enrolled in school in state B 
between July 2011 and June 2012, which he used, in part, to pay child support and his 
son’s medical expenses.6  
 
The SOR alleges 33 delinquent debts totaling $57,083. As Department Counsel 
conceded at hearing, the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q was not established by the record.7  
Nevertheless, Applicant provided in his post-hearing submissions a copy of a document 
                                                          
2 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from 
Applicant’s SOR answer, SCA (GE 1), and the summary of his subject interview (GE 2).

evincing that he paid the debt in full.8 In his SOR answer, he admitted to the following 
debts: SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.p, 1.r through 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.x, 1.y, 1.aa through 1.gg. 
 
Applicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. (June 2016), 1.e (March 
2017), 1.h (May 2015), 1.j (February 2017), 1.k (March 2017), 1.p (March 2017), 1.q 
(August 2011), 1.u (February 2017), and 1.gg (February 2017).9 The remaining 24 
unresolved SOR debts include two automobile loans totaling $23,586 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 
1.r), nine medical accounts totaling $5,020 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.l, 1.n, 1.y, 1.z, 1.ee, 
and 1.ff), a $6,896 personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.b), five utility accounts totaling $1,789 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.i, 1.m, 1.w, 1.aa, and 1.bb), a $99 credit-card account (SOR ¶ 1.o), a $395 
collection account of unknown origin (SOR ¶ 1.s.), a $35 Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) overpayment (SOR ¶ 1.t), two court fees totaling $1,385 (SOR ¶¶ 1.v and 1.x), a 
$300 red-light camera ticket (SOR ¶ 1.cc), and a $198 insurance account (SOR ¶ 1.dd). 
Applicant’s credit report revealed two additional VA debts that were not alleged in the 
SOR totaling $4,472.10   
 
After the transmission broke on Applicant’s truck in the summer of 2010, he fell 
behind on its loan payments due to the extra expenses he incurred to buy parts to fix it 
and to pay another loan on a replacement vehicle. Despite his plea for more time, his 
creditor repossessed it in September 2010 and charged off his account in the amount of 
$6,027 (SOR ¶1.c). Since then, he spoke with the creditor once in about September 
2016 to attempt to resolve this debt and then he intended to make contact again in early 
2017 but never did. At his hearing, Applicant stated that he plans to make contact at 
some point to work out a monthly payment agreement.11   
 
After an accident that totaled his car in late 2007, the insurance provider for the 
driver at fault did not pay the claim to which Applicant was entitled. There remains 
$17,559 of debt outstanding of the loan of the totaled car (SOR ¶ 1.r). Because he was 
not at fault, Applicant denies liability for this debt. Each time he has submitted a dispute 
of the charge, the debt is confirmed as valid. He does not plan to pay this debt, but is 
still researching options for otherwise resolving it.12 
 
Applicant is responsible, by court order, for providing medical insurance for his 
son and for paying one-half of any expenses not covered by insurance. Since 
approximately September 2015, he and his son have been covered through his wife’s 
medical insurance. Applicant believes that his son’s medical expenses comprise all of

the unresolved medical debt alleged in the SOR, which totals $5,020 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 
1.g, 1.l, 1.n, 1.y, 1.z, 1.ee, and 1.ff).13 His son’s mother does not always communicate 
with Applicant when these medical expenses are incurred, and he does not receive bills 
directly from the provider unless she provides them with his address. While he received 
the associated explanation of benefits forms from his insurance provider for these 
expenses, he did not recognize the actual notice that they afforded him of these 
expenses. Instead, he stated that he is not aware of these expenses until they appear 
on his credit report. Nevertheless, Applicant acknowledges that he is at least partially 
responsible for their repayment. He plans to take court action against his son’s mother 
to compel her to communicate with him about his son’s medical expenses and to 
contribute her share. At some point, Applicant plans to call each provider to set up 
payment arrangements to pay the unresolved medical debt.14   
 
Applicant has not paid the balance of $6,896 on a personal loan he obtained 
while in the military (SOR ¶ 1.b). At some point, he thought that he had discharge 
insurance, which would cover the balance. However, he acknowledges that he does not 
have such insurance and that he is responsible for the debt. He has not yet paid this 
debt because he chose to tackle smaller debts first.15  
 
 Applicant stated, without providing documentary proof, that 1) he paid the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.t and 1.w,16 2) has been making payments to a collection company 
to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.s, 1.v, 1.x, 1.z (one of the unresolved medical 
debts),17 and 3) his non-SOR VA debts were resolved with a garnishment of his 2016 
federal tax refund.18 He also stated, without providing documentary proof, that he 
disputed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.aa.19 As to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.m, 
1.o, 1.y (one of the unresolved medical debts), and 1.bb through 1.dd, Applicant stated 
that he plans to pay them.20  
 
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant became delinquent with his child 
support payments during his period of underemployment while residing in state B. He 
accrued arrearages of approximately $9,000 (which included unpaid child support and 
medical expenses) as of August 2014, which had been reduced to approximately 
                                                          
13 However, included among his post-hearing submissions was an animal-related emergency medical bill 
(SOR ¶ 1.y).

$1,000 as of March 2017. He is paying an extra amount in addition to his regularly 
monthly child support obligation to repay the arrearage. His income tax refunds were 
also applied to his arrearage balance.21  
 
Applicant attributes most of his debt to his periods of underemployment and 
unemployment between May 2011 and February 2013. However, he acknowledges that 
some of his debt accrued while serving in the Air Force during a time when he was 
“young and dumb” and did not manage his finances responsibly.22 In 2010, he received 
an Article 15 for using his government-issued credit card to pay for personal expenses 
of approximately $1,300, including utility and insurance bills and expenses for his son. 
Applicant stated that he paid attorney fees and other costs associated with legal actions 
related to his son in 2010 and at other times. He did not provide specific timeframes or 
costs, but recounted having paid approximately $3,000 for his attorney and 
approximately $500 to $1,500 for costs related to travel and court filings.23 
 
Applicant received a loan of $6,500 in February 2017 from his grandmother to 
assist him in repaying his delinquent debt. As of March 2017, approximately $400 to 
$500 remained.24 He used funds from a 401k loan of approximately $3,000 to pay the 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, which he settled for approximately $2,800.25  
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling.26 Applicant’s monthly expenses 
are between $4,800 to $5,000, whereas he and his wife’s combined income totals 
approximately $4,200 to $4,800 per month.27 They both work extra jobs to help keep 
their finances from going into the red. They were last in the red approximately one year 
to eighteen months ago.28  
 
During his August 2014 subject interview, Applicant promised to contact his 
creditors to resolve his delinquent debts. When asked at the hearing, he attributed his 
delay in reaching out to the creditors about his remaining debts to his “[self-]pride” in not 
wanting to borrow money, and “life happen[ing]” due to the number of individuals with 
whom he shares his home.29

Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”30 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”31 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”32 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”33 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.34 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”35 The guidelines presume a nexus or

rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.36 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.37 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.38 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”39 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”40 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors:

AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that 
remain unresolved. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. The underemployment that followed his 
voluntary relocation and the unemployment that followed his firing were not 
circumstances largely beyond his control. I do find that circumstances largely beyond 
his control contributed to the accumulation of his son’s medical expenses (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 
1.f, 1.g, 1.l, 1.n, 1.y, 1.z, 1.ee, and 1.ff), the car loan debts resulting from his 2007 car 
accident (SOR ¶ 1.r) and 2010 broken transmission (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant has acted 
responsibly with respect to the medical expenses and accident-related car loan. 
However, I do not find that Applicant has acted responsibly with respect to the 
transmission-related car loan. Similarly, Applicant did not act responsibly in addressing 
the debts accumulated due to his underemployment or unemployment should either be 
deemed to be a circumstance beyond his control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant has not received financial 
counseling. Because he did not provide corroborating documents, I cannot conclude 
that Applicant has paid the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.t and 1.w, that he has been 
making payments to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.s, 1.v, 1.x, 1.z, that his non-
SOR VA debts have been resolved, or that he disputed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.aa. 
Even if I were to so conclude, those actions would not suffice to mitigate the Guideline F 
concerns. Moreover, Applicant’s plan to pay his remaining debts is not reasonable in 
light of the existing record. While I credit Applicant with resolving the debts alleged in 
 
9 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.q, 1.u, and 1.gg and with his efforts to resolve other 
debts, I cannot conclude that his financial situation is under control at this time.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant did not articulate a reasonable basis to 
dispute the debt alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.aa, nor did he provide any documentary proof to 
substantiate his dispute or any actions taken to resolve the issue. 
 
Accordingly, I find in favor of Applicant as to SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d through 1.h, 1.j 
through 1.l, 1.n, 1.p through 1.r, 1.u, 1.y, 1.z, and 1.ee through 1.gg. There remain 14 
unresolved SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.m, 1.o, 1.s, 1.t, 1.v through 1.x, and 1.aa 
through 1.dd), totaling $17,124. I have considered the progress that Applicant has made 
in tackling his delinquent debt and the fact that he is not required to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance.41 However, Applicant’s plan for repayment of 
his outstanding debts is not reasonable in light of the existing record. Moreover, his 
actions from August 2014 through present and the current state of his financial affairs 
do not sufficiently demonstrate that he is both willing and able to follow through with his 
plan. Therefore, I cannot find that Applicant has met his burden to overcome the 
Guideline F concerns at this time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(a). Applicant was candid and sincere 
at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial 
                                                          
41 ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by “concomitant 
conduct” that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan).
