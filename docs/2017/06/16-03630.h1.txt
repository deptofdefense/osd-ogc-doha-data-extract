FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 16, 2015. 
On December 31, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1  
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines. The SEAD 4 guidelines apply to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 
8, 2017. My decision is based on the guidelines in SEAD 4, referred to in this decision as “AG.” The 
changes resulting from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on January 12, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 
2, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 2, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for March 23, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Department 
Counsel’s letter to Applicant, dated February 2, 2017, complying with the discovery 
requirement in Directive ¶ E3.1.13, is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through V, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until March 30, 2017, to enable him to 
substitute copies for several original documents and to submit additional documentary 
evidence. He substituted copies for the original documents, but he did not submit any 
additional evidence. (HX II). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶1.b-1.e, 
1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.o-1.q, and 1.t-1.cc. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.r, 
and 1.s. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings 
of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 36-year-old systems engineering field technician employed by a 
defense contractor since February 2005. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 2004. 
He attended college from August 2005 to June 2009 but did not receive an additional 
degree. (GX 2 at 2.) He has held a security clearance since June 2005.  
 
 When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed numerous debts and his failure 
to file federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014. The SOR alleges 25 
delinquent debts totaling about $98,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.y), failures to file federal and 
state income tax returns for tax year 2014 (SOR ¶¶ 1.z-1.bb), and federal and state tax 
debts totaling about $1,600 (SOR ¶ 1.cc). His delinquent debts are reflected in his credit 
bureau reports (CBRs) from November 2015 and October 2016 (GX 3 and GX 4). 
 
 Applicant married in August 2004 and separated in March 2014. (Tr. 47.) He has 
no children. He and his wife were together for nine years before they married in 2004. 
Applicant testified that his wife had been unfaithful on multiple occasions, starting before 
they were married. Her infidelity continued after they were married. When it happened 
again in March 2014, he could not deal with it any longer. (Tr. 52.) The marital breakup 
was emotionally and financially devastating for Applicant, and for a while he “had given 
up on life.” (Tr. 44-46.) He testified that his delinquencies were caused by his marital 
separation and the transition from a single household with two incomes to separate 
households. He testified that he suffered a period of severe depression, but he was 
unable to seek financial or medical assistance because he could not afford it. (Tr. 37-38, 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
3 
 
62) He did not provide any medical evidence of his depression or its effect on his ability 
to manage his finances. 
 
Before the separation, Applicant and his wife were heavily indebted, but they 
were able to make minimum payments on their debts. After the separation, they were 
unable to support two households and pay their bills. (Tr. 47-48, 51.) The evidence 
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: student loan placed for collection of $25,389. Applicant entered a 
rehabilitation program in October 2016, requiring monthly $22 payments. He completed 
the rehabilitation program in March 2017 and is now paying $127 per month. (AX A; Tr. 
37-38.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e: credit-card accounts charged off for $4,648; $4,633; $3,912; 
and $2,950. Applicant testified that he is not yet able to make payments on these debts. 
(Tr. 39.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: membership store debt referred for collection of $2,272. Applicant 
is making monthly payments of around $20 on this debt. (Tr. 39) His documentary 
evidence reflects an electronic debit of $25 and a balance of $1,102 as of February 
2017. (AX D.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: credit-card account charged off for $1,998. This debt is being 
collected by garnishment that began in May 2016. (AX E.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: charged-off account for $1,712. Applicant is paying $20 per month 
payment by direct debit. (AX F.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,557. This debt is 
being collected by garnishment that began in February 2017. $680 was deducted from 
Applicant’s pay in March 2017. (AX G.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,363. This debt is 
being collected by garnishment. $50 was deducted from Applicant’s pay in March 2017. 
(AX H.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k: department store charge account referred for collection of 
$1,203. Applicant is paying $30 per month by direct debit. (AX I.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l: credit-card account referred for collection of $895. Applicant is 
paying $25 per month by direct debit. (AX J.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m: department store charge account charged off for $877. Applicant 
is paying $25 per month by check. (AX K.) 
 
 
4 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.n: membership store debt referred for collection of $866. Applicant 
is paying $30 per month by direct debit. (AX L.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o: sporting-goods store debt referred for collection of $861. In 
March 2017, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt for $486 or make monthly 
payments of $108 or $50. (AX M.) He testified that he is making monthly $50 payments, 
but he submitted no documentation to support his testimony. (Tr. 40-41.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p: collection account for $840. Applicant made a $211 payment by 
post-dated check in January 2017. (AX N.) Applicant testified that the account has been 
settled, but his documentation does not reflect it. (Tr. 41.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.q: collection account for $633. Applicant testified that this is a 
fraudulent account. The demand for payment from the collection agency lists a debtor 
other than Applicant, and Applicant does not recognize the listed debtor. (AX O; Tr. 41.) 
He told the collection agency that the debt was not his, but he has not filed a dispute 
with the credit bureau. He testified that he was not aware of his right to file a dispute 
with the credit bureau, and he believed that the collection agency would take care of 
correcting the credit report. (Tr. 61.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.r: judgment for $881 in unpaid rent filed in May 2015. Applicant 
testified that this judgment was filed after he paid his rent. He submitted a current bill 
showing that his rent payments are current. (AX P; Tr. 42.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.s: delinquent mortgage loan past due for $26,807, in foreclosure 
with a loan balance of $164,991. Applicant testified that this debt was for the marital 
home. Foreclosure was initiated, but he was able to settle the debt through a short sale. 
(AX Q; Tr. 42.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.t and 1.u: telephone bill placed for collection of $2,562 and credit-
card account placed for collection of $9,724. Applicant testified that he has been 
financially unable to make any payments on these accounts. (Tr. 42-43.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.v: charged-off account for $860. This debt is a duplicate of the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o. 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.w and 1.y: parking tickets referred for collection of $141 and 101. 
Applicant testified that he was unaware of these debts and had not investigated them, 
but that he intends to pay them. (Tr. 43.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.x: medical bill placed for collection of $101. Applicant testified that 
he did not recognize this debt. The contact information for the collection agency is 
reflected in the November 2015 CBR, but Applicant had not contacted it. (Tr. 43.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.z-1.cc: past-due federal and state tax returns and tax debt. 
Applicant filed his federal and state income tax return for 2014 in March 2017. His 
 
5 
 
returns reflect that he owes $1,891 in federal taxes and is entitled to refunds of $935 
and $408 from the two states in which he resided during tax year 2014. (AX S; AX T; AX 
U; Tr. 43-44.) Applicant requested an installment agreement for his federal tax debt, but 
the IRS had not approved his request as of the date of the hearing. He also owes about 
$600 for tax year 2015, and he has submitted a request for an installment agreement for 
this debt as well. (Tr. 58.) 
 
The garnishments for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.k, and 1.j take 25 percent of 
Applicant’s gross income. He testified that he expects the garnishments to end in June 
2017, at which time he will be able to start making payments on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.c-1.e. (Tr. 53.) He articulated no specific plan to address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, 
1.w, and 1.y. 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 
6 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, his testimony at the hearing, and the documentary 
evidence submitted at the hearing are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions 
in AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”); AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”); and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required”). 
 
7 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AGA ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to 
resolve the issue; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. Applicant’s marital breakup was a condition 
largely beyond his control, but his financial situation was precarious before he and his 
wife separated. He attributes his lack of diligence in making his financial affairs to 
depression, but he offered no medical evidence that he had a psychological condition 
that prevented him from managing his financial affairs. He has acted responsibly 
regarding the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k-1.n, 1.q-1.s, and 1.v, but not for 
the other debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant present no evidence that he sought or 
received financial counseling, and his financial situation is not under control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, 
1.k-1.n, 1.q-1.s, and 1.v. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, 1.i, and 
1.j, because payment by involuntary garnishment, “is not the same as, or similar to, a 
 
8 
 
good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.” ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 24, 2011). It is not established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q. The documentary 
evidence establishes that the debtor is someone other than Applicant. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is not established. Applicant has requested an installment agreement 
for his federal tax debt, but the IRS has not granted his request. Applicant has not made 
any payments on the debt. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶¶ 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant 
eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant 
was candid and sincere at the hearing. He acted reasonably regarding the delinquent 
mortgage loan in SOR ¶ 1.s. I have credited him with making nominal payments on 
several large debts, but it will take him years to resolve these debts at his current rate of 
payment. He was living on the financial brink before his marital breakup, and he allowed 
his financial situation to spin out of control after it. He has offered no persuasive excuse 
for failing to file his federal and state tax returns.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and failure to timely 
file his federal and state income tax returns. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried 
his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of 
the United States to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:      For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.e:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.f:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.g:     Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.h:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.i-1.j:    Against Applicant 
 
9 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.k-1.n:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.o-1.p:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.q-1.s:    For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.t-1.u:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.v:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.w-1.cc:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is denied.
