GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 15, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. He responded to those 
interrogatories on September 14, 2016. On October 29, 2016, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and 
 
2 
                                      
 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a sworn statement, dated December 5, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Following 
Applicant’s Response to the SOR, the Government, pursuant to ¶ E.3.1.13, Directive, 
amended the SOR by deleting a portion of SOR ¶ 1.j. and substituting new dates and 
figures. He was advised to provide an answer to the revised allegation in his Response 
to the FORM, and if he failed to do so, his silence would be treated as a denial of the 
amended allegation. A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material 
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on January 30, 2017, and he was afforded an 
opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, 
Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the previous Adjudicative 
Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on February 14, 2017. 
Applicant’s response was due on March 16, 2017. As of October 1, 2017, Applicant had 
not submitted any response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 
2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments nearly all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b., and 1.d. through 
1.i.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has served in an 
unspecified business operation position since June 1979. He is a 1977 high school 
graduate. Although he attended a university for several years, he did not obtain a degree. 
Applicant has never served in the U.S. military. Applicant was granted a SECRET security 
clearance in 1999; access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in 2006; and a 
TOP SECRET security clearance in 2006. Although Applicant indicated that his security 
clearance and SCI access was lowered to a SECRET security clearance in 2013, it was 
actually revoked in 2010, and he was permitted to retain his SECRET security clearance 
in 2013, following a favorable decision on his eligibility issued by DOHA in August 2013. 
                                                          
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for 
access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were established to supersede all previously 
issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on 
September 1, 2006, under which this security clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the 
two versions, there is no substantial difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.

Applicant was married in 1996. He has a son, born in 2000, and a stepdaughter, born in 
1990.  
 
Financial Considerations2 
Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems which he attributed, in part, 
to “[p]oor money and debt management and failure to live within means.”3 In addition, in 
June 2015, he stated:4 
Subject: Explanation of Derogatory Credit from early 2000 thru 
approximately mid-2007, [Applicant] was working between 25-30% 
overtime. This equal[s] about an extra paycheck a month. During this period 
our spending and credit accumulation was at a level of our combined 
income. We purchased two vehicles, took out a second mortgage to 
complete almost $100,000 remodeling to our house, which included credit 
for major appliances. With the added income, meeting our credit obligation 
and monthly house[hold] expenses was attainable. Around October 2007, 
[Applicant’s] [overtime] was reduced to zero without any prior notice. With 
spending to the level of our income, not budgeting, and/or putting away 
savings, it did not take long before credit cards were maxed out to pay 
monthly expenses, and shortly thereafter falling behind credit cards and 
other credits obligations. By the middle of 2008, we were . . . starting to fall 
behind on our house payments and [were] not making regular payments 
[on] our obligation[s] and soon thereafter [we] stop[ped] making payments 
on some creditors altogether. Around the beginning of 2009 we were falling 
further behind on our house payment. We [requested] relief from our 
mortgage company, and relief was denied. With denial of relief from our 
mortgage company, and foreclosure the only remaining option, house 
payment[s] were stopped. Many creditors had close[d] accounts, charge[d] 
off the accounts, and/or turned over accounts . . . to collections. Our house 
foreclosed in August 2009. Since August of 2009, we have paid off creditors 
who were actively seeking payments, both cars, and [we] [are] now working 
on paying off all creditors that have balances on our credit reports. We have 
hired a company to help negotiate settlement offers and clean up our credit 
scores. Our goal is to have all credit balances paid off around January 2016 
and credit scores increased to above 640. I am current on all payments to 
creditors and household items. 
Applicant’s description of events is not complete for it omits several significant 
details. On June 16, 1995, he filed for bankruptcy as an individual under Chapter 13 of 
                                                          
2 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following 
exhibits: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated June 15, 2015); Item 4 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated September 14, 2016); Item 4 
(Personal Subject Interview, dated December 14, 2015); Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2016).

the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 10, 1998, an “Order Approving Account Discharging 
Trustee and Closing Estate Chapter 7” was entered.5 It is unclear what the reference to 
Chapter 7 is meant to convey. On April 15, 1998, Applicant and his wife filed a joint petition 
for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A Chapter 7 Trustees 
meeting of creditors was held in May 1998, but the Chapter 13 plan was approved in June 
1998. On November 28, 2000 another “Order Approving Account Discharging Trustee 
and Closing Estate Chapter 7” was entered.6 On February 22, 2013, an SOR was issued 
to Applicant alleging 22 continuing delinquencies totaling $41,075.7 It was determined that 
Applicant had paid creditors, either through garnishments or settlements, $15,642, of 
which $10,000 was paid to non-SOR creditors. That SOR did not address federal and 
state income tax returns or federal tax liens. On August 2, 2013, a favorable decision was 
issued by the administrative judge in which the administrative judge noted:8 
 
[Applicant and his wife], however, accepted responsibility for their actions 
and created a plan to resolve their debts. They changed their spending 
habits and now live within their income. They are resolving all their old 
debts, a few at a time. Their budget reflects that they have dedicated a sum 
of money each month to pay old debts, a few at a time. Their budget reflects 
that they have dedicated a sum of money each month to pay old debts. 
Applicant’s current SOR as supplemented alleges the two bankruptcy filings (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.); and it alleges that he had failed to timely file his federal and state income 
tax returns for the tax years 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 
2011, 2012, and 2013, as required (SOR ¶ 1.c.);9 his continuing indebtedness to the 
                                                          
5 Item 7 (PACER Chapter 13 History, dated July 11, 2016). It is unclear why the PACER Chapter 13 History 
refers to Chapter 7, for, other than in the PACER records, there are no references to Chapter 7 elsewhere is the case 
file. 
 
6 Item 6 (PACER Chapter 13 History, dated July 11, 2016). The PACER Chapter 13 History again refers to 
Chapter 7 for reasons that are not explained. 
 
7 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. 
Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's 
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) 
to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 
26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 
24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 
(App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s financial issues as 
raised in the previous DOHA security clearance eligibility decision will be considered only for the five purposes listed 
above.   
 
8 See ISCR Case No. 11-07202, at 9 (Aug. 2, 2013).  
 
               9 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon certain conditions, including an 
individual’s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, 
the following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by 
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any 
information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, 
or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to 
other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be 
fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1

Federal Government for delinquent income taxes for a variety of years (SOR ¶¶ 1.c. 
through 1.i.); and his continuing indebtedness to the Federal Government for a tax lien in 
the approximate amount of $20,900 (SOR ¶ 1.j.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated that all of his tax returns have been filed, and that he was working with a tax 
attorney to arrive at a settlement and payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). Those debts, totaling approximately $30,396.88, and his filing issues, their current 
status, according to the evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, are 
described as follows:  
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns 
for the tax year 1999, as required: The information submitted by Applicant is inconsistent. 
He submitted a U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) prepared by his tax 
preparer on April 15, 2003, and signed by Applicant and his wife that same date – three 
years after they were due. However, according to the IRS, Applicant filed the Form 1040 
on April 17, 2006 – approximately six years after they were due.10 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns 
for the tax year 2003, as required: He submitted a Form 1040 prepared by his tax preparer

He submitted a Form 1040 prepared by his tax preparer, and signed by Applicant and his 
wife on August 23 and 26, 2014 – nine years after they were due. However, according to 
the IRS, Applicant filed the Form 1040 on April 10, 2006 – approximately one year after 
they were due.12 A note from the tax preparer indicates that the 2004 tax return was 
prepared on October 25, 2011. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns 
for the tax year 2005, as required: Applicant’s tax preparer prepared the Form 1040 on 
September 24, 2007 – approximately one year after they were due.13 There is no 
                                                          
year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with respect to 
such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such failure. In 
the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first sentence of this section shall 
be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 years" for "1 year."

installment plan on [December 7, 2015]. 
Applicant failed to address his repeated failures to file state income taxes for a 
multi-year period. It is not known what Applicant’s financial resources may be because 
he did not submit a Personal Financial Statement to reflect his net monthly income; 
monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary 
spending or savings. His IRS Account Transcript reflects an adjusted gross income for 
2015 of $202,865.00, and a taxable income of $161,396.31 While there are references to

a law firm working on credit restoration, a tax preparer to prepare Applicant’s income tax 
returns, and efforts to establish installment agreements with the IRS, there is no 
documentation to support those contentions. There is no evidence of a budget or any 
financial counseling. Applicant offered no explanations to indicate why he failed to timely 
file his federal and state income tax returns over a multi-year period, and he has failed to 
prove that his financial situation is now under control.  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”32 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”33   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation

34 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”36  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a

11 
                                      
 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying. In addition, AG ¶ 
19(b) may apply if there is an “unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do 
so.” Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
concerns. In addition, AG ¶ 19(f) may apply for “failure to file or fraudulently filing annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax as required.” Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax 
returns for the tax years 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 
2012, and 2013, as required. As a result, he incurred indebtedness to the IRS totaling 
approximately $30,396.88, including a tax lien. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”38 Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the individual has received 
or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, 
such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). 
Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated and is 
adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”39 
In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
                                                          
38 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s ongoing, 
unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the 
Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-
01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
39 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 
99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” Under AG ¶ 20(g), it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has 
made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and 
is in compliance with those arrangements.” 
 AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions 
apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
since 2003, or before, make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was 
so infrequent,” or that it is “unlikely to recur.” Applicant acknowledged that poor money 
and debt management and failure to live within means were, associated with the loss of 
overtime earnings, the reasons for his financial difficulties, but he offered no explanations 
for his failures to file his federal and state income tax returns, or pay his federal and state 
income taxes, over a multi-year period. With an adjusted gross income for 2015 of 
$202,865, and a taxable income of $161,396, it appears that Applicant simply chose to 
ignore his filing responsibilities and paying obligations. Instead, he delayed and avoided 
his obligations, and he eventually relied on garnishments of his wages and offsets of 
refunds to pay his federal taxes. There is no evidence that Applicant ever addressed his 
state income tax return filing obligations.  
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. 
An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant 
immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is 
there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be paid first. Rather, a reasonable 
plan and concomitant conduct in furtherance of the plan may provide for the payment of 
such debts one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further 
confirmed action, are insufficient. 
 
There is little evidence of an ongoing good-faith effort to contact the IRS or the 
state revenue departments to resolve Applicant’s delinquent federal and state income tax 
accounts.40 There is little evidence that the conditions that may have resulted in the 
financial issues after the period 2000 to 2007 were largely beyond Applicant=s control. 
There is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or any disputes. Applicant offered 
no evidence to indicate that his financial situation is now under control. Equally as 
important, there is no evidence that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, 
and that failure to do so continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment.41 
                                                          
40 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing 
with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 
4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to 
negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

13 
                                      
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.42   
There is some evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no evidence of 
misuse of information technology systems, or mishandling protected information. 
Applicant has been employed fulltime by the same employer since June 1979.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns over a 
lengthy multi-year period, commencing as far back as the tax year 1999 – nearly two 
decades. He failed to fully pay his federal income taxes over a multi-year period, and 
simply relied on garnishments and offsets by the IRS to address his federal debts. 
Eventually a federal tax lien was filed in the approximate amount of $20,900. He failed to 
address his failure to file his state income tax returns over a multi-year period. In June 
2015, Applicant stated “our goal is to have all credit balances paid off around January 
2016 and credit scores increased to above 640. I am current on all payments to creditors 
and household items.” That statement was not accurate for he omitted any references to 
his delinquent income taxes from as early as 1999. 
Considering Applicant’s multiple failures to timely file his federal and state income 
tax returns over a lengthy multi-year period, the absence of his responses with respect to 
his state income tax returns, the lack of evidence, more current than 2015, regarding his 
current finances, and the absence of character evidence regarding Applicant’s honesty, 
                                                          
42 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2006).

integrity, and trustworthiness, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:43 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination 
efforts. He avoided the federal and state income tax debts in his name, and failed to fulfill 
his promises to take timely corrective actions. Overall, the evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) 
through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f.:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.g. through 1.j.:  Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
