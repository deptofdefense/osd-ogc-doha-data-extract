Decision

KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on February 13, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On December 15, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
2 
 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on January 11, 2017, and requested a decision based on 
the written record without a hearing.   
 
On February 10, 2017 Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant February 13, 2017. He was given 30 days  
to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s 
evidence. Applicant received the FORM on February 23, 2017.3 Applicant did not respond 
to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were five items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4.4 Exhibits 1, 3, and 4 are admitted into evidence 
without objection. GE 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s 
interview that took place during the March 2016 background investigation. The ROI is not 
authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s 
written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not 
authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the authentication 
requirement. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond 
to the FORM, which response is optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of 
the authentication requirement. The record does not demonstrate that Applicant 
understood the concepts of authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not 
demonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving an objection to the 
admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 2 is inadmissible, and I have not considered 
the information in the ROI.    
 
 
                                                          
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My decision and 
formal findings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated February 13, 2017, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated February 23, 2017. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 
30 days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR and Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and the Answer are the 
pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 2 through 5 are marked as Exhibits 1 through 
4.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 27 years old and has his GED and some college credits. He has never 
married and has no children. He has been offered prospective employment by a defense 
contractor and needs a clearance to consummate that offer.6 
 
The SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling $2,482. The SOR also alleged 
that Applicant failed to file (1) federal tax returns for a company he operated for tax years 
2011 through 2015, (2) state tax returns for that same company for tax years 2011 through 
2015, (3) sales tax returns for that same company for tax years 2011 through 2013, (4) 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 through 2011, and (5) state income tax 
returns for the tax years 2009 and 2012 through 2014.7 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations, except for SOR ¶¶ 
1.c (a $204 debt), 1.d (an unquantified charge-off), 1.f (a $47 medical debt), and 1.k 
(failure to file federal tax returns for 2006 through 2011). There is record support for SOR 
¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f.8   
 
In his March 2015 security clearance application, Applicant stated that he had 
failed to file returns and pay his federal income and sale taxes for years 2011 through 
2013. That security clearance application provides record support for the year 2011, as 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. There is, however, no evidence to support years 2006 through 
2010, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. Applicant stated that unbeknownst to him his former 
business partner was to have handled the taxes but failed to do so. Applicant also stated 
that he had retained a CPA to assist him in resolving his tax problem.9  
 
In sum, I find that all allegations of delinquent debts are supported by the evidence. 
I also find that by virtue of Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and in his security 
clearance application, the tax allegations are supported by the evidence, except for the 
years 2006 through 2010 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k.  
  
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.10 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of

10 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to 
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a 
security clearance).

denials.”11 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.12 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.13 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.14 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.15 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.16 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.17 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.18 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.19 
 
     Discussion 
  
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,20 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise

5 
 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information….21 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
 AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required; 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for 
the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and,  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
Although there are delinquent debts supported by the evidence, the nub of this 
case is Applicant’s failure to file state and federal tax returns, as required. The evidence 
supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic tax history going back to 2011. 
                                                          
21 AG ¶ 18.

And his tax problems persisted as recently as January 2017, when he answered the SOR. 
This raises security concerns under AG ¶¶ 19(a), (b), (c), and (f).  The next inquiry is 
whether any mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Because Applicant did not respond to the FORM, the record is silent as to what 
Applicant did to responsibly address his tax problems, other than retain a CPA. Even if I 
credit Applicant’s explanation that his former business partner failed, without Applicant’s 
knowledge, to file tax returns, as a circumstance largely beyond Applicant’s control, the 
record does not support full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). Likewise, even if I credit 
Applicant with seeking counseling from a CPA, AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply, because there 
is no evidence that Applicant’s tax problem is being resolved or is under control. Nor does 
AG ¶ 20(d) apply. And AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply, because Applicant’s tax problems, at 
least on this record, still exist unresolved today.  
  
   The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.22 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:                   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
