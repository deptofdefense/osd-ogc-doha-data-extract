LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for access to classified information. He failed to present sufficient evidence to 
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from a history of tax 
problems consisting of a repeated failure to timely file tax returns and approximately  
$425,000 in back taxes, penalties, and interest owed to state and federal tax authorities. 
Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on September 2, 2014. This document is commonly known as 
a security clearance application. Thereafter, on August 22, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
 
2 
 
information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on October 19, 2016. He requested a decision 
based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Her response consisted of handwritten 
responses on a copy of the SOR. He did not include any attachments or enclosures.  
 
On November 28, 2016, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material 
information that could be adduced at a hearing. The file of relevant material (FORM) 
consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, some of 
which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision. The FORM was mailed to 
Applicant on December 9, 2016, who received it December 15, 2016. He did not reply 
within 30 days from receipt of the information as required. The case was assigned to me 
October 1, 2017.     
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Department Counsel’s FORM includes Exhibit 4, which, in part, is a report of 
investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview that took place during the 
November 2014 background investigation. The ROI is not authenticated by a witness as 
required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.1 In addition, the ROI is largely illegible. 
Accordingly, for both reasons, I have not considered the ROI in reaching my decision.  
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old self-employed business owner who requires a security 
clearance. He was previously granted a security clearance at the secret level in 2004.2 
He has owned his small business since 2000. His educational background includes four 
brief periods of study for license renewal, at three-year intervals, at an electrical and 
technical school during 2005-2014. He married in 1995 and divorced in 2008.   
 
In his August 2014 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed a minor 
tax problem consisting of failure to timely file tax returns in 1995 due to slow business, 
and he estimated that he owed $100.3 Otherwise, he reported no derogatory financial 
information. The SOR, as amended by Department Counsel in their FORM, alleges a 
history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of the following: (1) failure to timely 
file state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2002-2015; (2) approximately 
$159,990 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax years 2008-2014; (3) approximately 
                                                          
1 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge 
Ra’anan notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some 
to present a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan 
raises a number of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a 
pro se applicant.).

3 Exhibit 3 at 31-32.

$6,995 in back taxes owed to a state tax authority as reflected in a tax lien filed in 2005; 
(4) approximately $134,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS as reflected in a tax lien filed 
in 2006; (5) approximately $67,720 in back taxes owed to the IRS as reflected in a tax 
lien filed in March 2016; (6) approximately $57,092 in back taxes owed to the IRS as 
reflected in a tax lien filed in February 2016; (7) a $301 medical collection account; and 
(8) a past-due account in the amount of $219 with an outstanding balance of $1,758.  
 
The eight items noted above are established by Applicant’s admissions and the 
written record.4 There is no documentation in the written record to establish that the 
state or federal back taxes were paid, settled, in a payment arrangement, cancelled, 
forgiven, or otherwise resolved. In his response to written interrogatories, Applicant 
explained that his tax problems occurred because he “went through a tough time in [his] 
business [and] then went through a divorce, both caused [him] to fall behind.”5 In his 
answer to the SOR, he stated that he filed the past-due tax returns through 2014, but he 
did not provide documentary proof of filing.  
 
In addition to the failure to file returns and the back taxes, Applicant received a 
summons from the IRS in 2015 seeking documents and records about the income he 
received for tax years 2008-2014.6 He did not reply to the summons, and so the IRS 
brought an action in federal court to enforce the summons. The federal court scheduled 
an order to show cause hearing for January 6, 2016, but it did not take place because 
the Government voluntarily dismissed the case on January 4, 2016.7 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.8 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.9 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
                                                          
4 Answer to SOR; Exhibits 4, 6, 7, and 8.  
 
5 Exhibit 4 at 2.  
 
6 Exhibit 4.  
 
7 None of the matters in this paragraph were alleged in the SOR. I considered them for the limited 
purpose of assessing the nature, extent, and seriousness of Applicant’s tax problems under the whole-
person concept.

9 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a 
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no 
right to a security clearance).

standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”10 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.11 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.12 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.13 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.14 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.15 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.16 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.17 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.18 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.19

 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
 AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;   
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. He failed to timely file 
state and federal tax returns over a period of many years; he is indebted for 
approximately $425,000 for back taxes owned to state and federal tax authorities for 
multiple tax years; and both have filed tax liens against him. Indeed, this is one of the 
worst tax cases I have seen for some time. The repeated failure to file returns and to 
pay income taxes when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern 
to the federal government.20 This pattern of conduct also suggests that he has a 
problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. An applicant who has a history of not fulfilling their tax obligations may be 
said not to have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability required for 
access to classified information.  
 
 What’s missing here is documentation in support of Applicant’s case. Although 
he claimed he filed tax returns through tax year 2014, he did not produce 
documentation to that effect. Moreover, there is no documentation showing that he is 
                                                          
20 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

making progress in reducing the mountain of back taxes, penalties, and interest he 
owes the state and the IRS. AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply in his favor. Likewise, he 
receives no credit in mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g), which requires an applicant to show 
that he has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the 
amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. The fact that the IRS was 
forced to issue a summons, and then initiate an action in federal court to enforce that 
summons, to obtain relevant taxpayer information from Applicant suggests he is not 
inclined to comply with tax authorities. At bottom, his well-established history of tax 
problems shows that Applicant is not an acceptable security risk.  
 
 Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties creates doubt about his 
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In 
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the 
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also 
considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he did not meet his 
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.n:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
