Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and 
2014 until April 18, 2016. He did not establish his financial responsibility. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is 
denied.        
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On October 15, 2015, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Item 2. On 
July 23, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs). 
The SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
On September 29, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR and waived his right to 
a hearing before an administrative judge. Item 2. On November 2, 2016, Department 
Counsel completed the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On November 18, 2016, 
Applicant received the FORM, and on December 15, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received Applicant’s response to the FORM. On October 
 
2 
                                         
 
1, 2017, the case was assigned to me. The case file consists of four exhibits. Items 1-3; 
FORM response. Applicant did not object to any of the Government exhibits, and they 
were admitted into evidence. 
 
On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for 
all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted that he did not timely file his tax returns 
for 2012, 2013, and 2014, and he explained that he filed those three tax returns on April 
18, 2016. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and a DOD contractor has employed him as an engineer 
since August 2003.3 He served in the Air Force on active duty from 1985 to 1993, and he 
received an honorable discharge. In 1985, he married, and in 1991, he divorced. In 2002, 
he married, and his child and stepchildren were born in 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 
1990. He received an associate’s degree in 1982. There is no evidence of security 
violations, arrests, illegal drug possession or use, or alcohol-related incidents.   
 
In his October 15, 2015 SCA, Applicant disclosed he failed to file his 2011,4 2012, 
2013, and 2014 federal income tax returns because of procrastination. He noted in the 
comments section of his SCA: 
 
We are now expeditiously working to resolve these late filings and take this 
matter to heart. If it is determined we owe additional taxes, we will not 
hesitate to pay the required amount. I would like to state that all areas of 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.    
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s October 15, 2015 Questionnaire 
for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Item 2.  
  
4 Applicant’s alleged failure to timely file his federal income tax return for tax year 2011 and his 
alleged payment of a tax debt in 2010 through garnishment of his pay are not alleged in the SOR, and the 
record is not well developed on these issues. These two allegations will not be considered as part of the 
basis to revoke Applicant’s security clearance.

our financial life are stable and in good standing. Our debt ratio is less than 
35% and credit history is above average.  
 
In Applicant’s December 3, 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal 
subject interview (PSI), Applicant said he had not filed his 2011, 2012, 2013, or 2014 
federal income tax returns, and he planned to start organizing the paperwork with the 
intention of filing his tax returns in the next six weeks.5 He said he did not file the tax 
returns due to procrastination. He estimated that he owed the IRS about $12,000, and he 
planned to make a payment plan with the IRS or borrow funds to pay his federal tax debt. 
Applicant is not required to file a state tax return because his state of residence does not 
have state income taxes.    
 
On September 5, 2016, the IRS notified Applicant that he owed $15,842 for tax 
year 2012.6 On June 27, 2016, the IRS notified Applicant that he owed $4,827 for tax year 
2013, and on that document, a handwritten note indicates “paid” and includes a check 
number. On July 25, 2016, the IRS verified receipt of Applicant’s federal tax return for tax 
year 2014. On August 8, 2016, the IRS informed Applicant that he was scheduled to 
receive a refund of $1,724 for tax year 2015.  
 
Applicant adjusted gross income (AGI) on his federal income tax returns for tax 
year 2012 is $178,116. Applicant explained his AGI increased $8,000 in 2012 because 
he withdrew funds from his 401(k) account to fund his daughter’s college tuition. His AGI 
for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 was as follows: 2013 ($164,000); 2014 ($157,000); 
and 2015 ($141,929). He noted that the garnishment of his pay for taxes in 2010 did not 
show a long-standing problem with paying his taxes because of his 30 years on a 
professional workforce and his tax-paying history. He concluded his FORM response 
stating, “we are current on all filings and have established an automatic monthly withdraw 
and payment plan to the IRS for the 2012 owed taxes of approximately $15,000. Aside 
from this blemish, we have always remained in good standings with all other debts.”  
 
Applicant said his coworkers, friends, and family members respect him. He 
honorably served his country. He has held a security clearance for many years without a 
security violation. His performance reviews are exceptional. He and his wife have raised 
five children and four grandchildren. He is a proud American.    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
                                            
5 The source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s December 3, 2015 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI). Item 3. 
 
6 The source for the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response (Item 1) and the source 
for the next paragraph is Applicant’s FORM response.

is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the 
ability to do so;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(f) failure to file 
or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. AG ¶¶ 19(b), 19(c), and 
19(f) are established.  
 
Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,7 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
                                            
7 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
6 
                                         
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;8   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
                                            
8 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

7 
                                         
 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 2012, 2013, 
and 2014. He filed those tax returns on April 18, 2016. The amount of taxes owed for tax 
year 2012 is about $15,000. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with 
the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.9 For 
purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal 
income tax returns against him as a federal crime.  
 
In regard to the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA 
Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
                                            
9 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without 
regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 
479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United 
States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). Applicant did 
not provide a copy of his payment arrangement with the IRS and proof that he is in 
compliance with those arrangements, and AG ¶ 20(g) does not fully apply.  
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress sooner resolving his tax issues. There is insufficient assurance that his financial 
problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all 
the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns 
are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
 
9 
                                         
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and a DOD contractor has employed him as an engineer 
since August 2003.  He served in the Air Force from 1985 to 1993, and he received an 
honorable discharge. In 2002, he married; his child and stepchildren were born in 1980, 
1984, 1985, 1986, and 1990; and he has four grandchildren. He received an associate’s 
degree in 1982. Applicant said his coworkers, friends, and family members respect him. 
His performance reviews are exceptional. He is a proud American. There is no evidence 
of security violations, arrests, illegal drug possession or use, or alcohol-related incidents.   
 
The evidence against grant of his security clearance is more substantial. He failed 
to file his 2012, 2013, and 2014 federal income tax returns until April 18, 2016 because 
of procrastination. He owes $15,000 in delinquent federal taxes. When a tax issue is 
involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to 
file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the 
applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.10 The 
                                            
10 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his 
children’s college tuition and expenses, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized 
“the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure 
to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government 
rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified

primary problem here is that Applicant has known that he needed to file federal income 
tax returns for several years, and he waited until April 18, 2016 to file his tax returns. He 
promised to work expeditiously to file his tax return in his October 15, 2015 SCA. His filing 
of all unfiled tax returns on April 18, 2016 is too little too late to mitigate security concerns. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
