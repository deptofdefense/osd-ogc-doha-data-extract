Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has significant unresolved delinquent debts, and made little to no effort 
to resolve them before the hearing, despite being gainfully employed with ample assets. 
His post-hearing efforts were not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for continued access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 19, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006.

 Applicant answered the SOR on June 8, 2016 and requested a hearing. He lives 
and works at a location in the Middle East. On September 28, 2016, Department 
Counsel mailed discovery to Applicant and requested that the case be assigned to an 
administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings & Appeals (DOHA) for 
scheduling. Applicant confirmed receipt of the Government’s discovery package on 
November 29, 2016.1  
 
On June 21, 2017, the assigned administrative judge issued a Notice of Hearing 
scheduling the hearing for September 27, 2017, a date Applicant initially agreed to.2 On 
August 9, 2017, Applicant requested a continuance to a date in October 2017, when he 
would be back in the continental United States for other reasons. (HE III)  
 
On August 10, 2017, Department Counsel opposed the motion, on the grounds 
that: 1) Applicant had previously agreed to the September 27 hearing date; and 2) 
funding for the federal government past September 30, 2017, was then in doubt, thus 
putting an October hearing date at risk, meaning the hearing might have to be 
postponed indefinitely, given Applicant’s location overseas. The assigned Administrative 
Judge denied the continuance motion the same day on that basis. (HE III) On August 
14, 2017, he assigned the case to me due to a conflict in his schedule. 
  
 Applicant’s hearing convened on September 27, 2017, as scheduled. 
Department Counsel submitted Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant 
testified and submitted three exhibits, which were marked as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through C. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I held the record open until 
October 13, 2017, to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
documentation.  
 
Applicant timely submitted three e-mails (marked together as AE D), an updated 
SOR response (AE E) and five documents (AE F through AE J). AE D through AE J are 
admitted without objection. The record closed upon their receipt.3 DOHA received the 
transcript on October 6, 2017.  
 
On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).

2 “On June 21, 2017, [Applicant] acknowledged his availability for the hearing on September 27, 2017.” 
(Aug. 10, 2017 e-mail of Department Counsel Morin) (HE III) 
 
3 HE IV. In one of his post-hearing e-mails, Applicant requested that DOHA “revisit” his financial situation 
in six months, by which point he expected to eliminate a large amount of his remaining debt. (AE D) The 
Directive does not allow for such action. ¶ E.3.1.10 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive states that “The 
Administrative Judge . . . shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.” (Emphasis 
added) Additionally, ¶ E3.1.25 states that “The Administrative Judge shall make a written clearance 
decision in a timely manner . . .” An applicant is not entitled to a delayed or deferred adjudication of his 
security eligibility. ISCR Case No. 09-02926 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2010).

The new AGs became effective on June 8, 2017, for all adjudicative decisions on or 
after that date.4  
 
Amendments to the Statement of Reasons 
 
 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform 
certain allegations to the record evidence. SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c were amended to 
reflect that the tax liens alleged were issued by a county tax authority, not a state tax 
authority.5 SOR ¶ 1.d was withdrawn because that tax debt had been paid. SOR ¶ 1.g 
was amended to change the amount owed from $6,513 to $5,428. Similarly, SOR ¶ 1.n 
was amended to change the amount owed from $2,409 to $2,384. These SOR 
amendments were granted without objection. (Tr. 16-19, 99-102).  
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.s. He denied SOR ¶¶ 
1.a-1.c (as originally drafted) and ¶ 1.d (later withdrawn). He denied SOR ¶ 1.t as being 
duplicative of SOR ¶ 1.s. He neglected to answer SOR ¶ 1.u, but he denied it at the 
hearing. (Tr. 11-12) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. 
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the 
following additional findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 49 years old. He was first married between February 2007 and 
August 2011. He remarried in October 2012; his second marriage lasted about a year. 
(Tr. 33-35, 80)  
 
Applicant has two children, ages seven and five. His son was born in 2010 to a 
woman he became involved with while he was separated from his first wife. The boy 
and his mother live in a foreign country. Applicant’s daughter was born in 2012. She 
lives with her mother, Applicant’s second wife, in a different foreign country. He testified 
that he pays a combined $1,500 a month in child support for his two children. (Tr. 35-36, 
63-65, 80)6   
 
 Applicant served honorably in the United States Army from 1986 to 2006. He 
retired as a staff sergeant (E-6). His decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, 
four Army Commendation Medals, and five Army Achievement Medals. (AE G) Since 
retiring from the Army, he has worked for a large defense contractor. He has not had 
any periods of unemployment. From 2006 to 2011, his home of record was in the United 
                                                          
4 The new AGs were discussed with the Applicant at the start of the hearing. (Tr. 8-10)  
 
5 SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c now begin, “You are indebted to [XXX County, State YYY] for a tax lien . . .”, 
instead of “You are indebted to the State of [YYY] for a tax lien  . . .” 
 
6 Applicant listed neither of his two children on his 2014 security clearance application. (GE 1) 
 
 
4 
 
 
States, in State 1. During much of this time, however, he was deployed overseas. He 
earned about $65,000 to $67,000 in that position. (Tr. 36-42; GE 1) 
 
 Since early 2012, Applicant has lived and worked in the Middle East. He has held 
a security clearance since he joined the Army in 1986, and he needs a clearance for his 
job. (Tr. 14-15, 38-39, 89, 92; GE 1) 
  
 Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in December 2014. 
He disclosed several delinquent debts, including a mortgage, an auto loan, and another 
unpaid loan, and indicated that they were due to his divorce. (GE 1). The SOR (as 
amended) alleged 20 delinquent debts, totaling about $66,478.  
  
County tax liens: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($703), 1.b ($840), 1.c ($733) and the withdrawn ¶1.d ($1,083) are 
tax liens issued by a county tax authority in State 2, where Applicant’s parents live. 
Applicant testified that the liens are attached to a property where his father manages a 
business. He also testified that at some point, his father asked him to put his name on 
the property deed.7 He acknowledged at hearing that he was nonetheless responsible 
for the resulting liens, which he thought might relate to unpaid property taxes. (Tr. 65-
70)8 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c all relate to liens filed in 2012, 2013, and 2014, 
respectively. Similarly, the withdrawn SOR ¶ 1.d was filed (and released) in 2015. (GE 
2, GE 4) GE 5 also reflects two additional, more recent county tax liens: 1) a $1,137 
lien, filed in March 2016; and 2) a $1,215 lien, filed in March 2017. Neither of these 
more recent liens was alleged in the SOR.  
 
Applicant testified that the day before the hearing, he went to the county tax 
office in State 2 to resolve these debts. (Tr. 65-70) AE A reflects that he paid $189 to 
resolve a 2015 county tax bill (for which AE C was the invoice). AE B reflects that he 
paid $1,530 to pay a 2016 tax bill. A post-hearing document (AE I) also reflects that this 
debt has been paid.  
 
Other SOR debts:  
 
 At hearing, Applicant provided no documents concerning any of the other SOR 
debts, most of which he admitted. All of them are, or appear to be, consumer debts that 
have been either charged off or reported to a collection agency. They include: SOR ¶¶ 
                                                          
7 AE A, AE B and AE C are all addressed to Applicant, either at the business’s address, or his parent’s 
home address, both in State 2.  
 
8 Post-hearing, Applicant asserted that his father’s business had closed. (AE E) He provided a June 2015 
letter from the State 2 Department of Revenue regarding the closure of an unnamed account. The letter is 
addressed to “[Applicant’s First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name,] Inc.” (AE H)  He indicated that he was 
attempting to have his name removed from the business property. (AE D)

1.e ($11,115); 1.f ($7,394); 1.g ($5,428); 1.h ($5,261); 1.i ($4,963); 1.j ($4,914); 1.k 
($3,631); 1.l ($3,191); 1.m ($2,633); 1.n ($2,384); 1.o ($2,402); 1.p ($537); 1.q ($2,000); 
1.r ($5,068); 1.s ($1,615); 1.t ($1,515) and 1.u ($250). All these debts are listed on 
Applicant’s January 2015 credit report. (GE 2) Some of them are also listed on his 
March 2016 credit report, (GE 3), or his August 2017 credit report. (GE 6)9  
 
Applicant denied SOR ¶ 1.t as being duplicative of SOR ¶ 1.s. Both are debts to 
a cell phone company. He testified that he had only one account there, and had not had 
one since 2011. (Tr. 83-85) The accounts allege dollar amounts that are $1 apart 
($1,516 and $1,515). Both are listed on the same credit report. (GE 2 at 17)  
 
 Applicant stated in his answer that “[t]he majority of the debt[s] are the direct 
result of a bad divorce.” By this, he meant his first marriage. He indicated that he helped 
his first wife financially with loans and a car purchase. (SOR ¶ 1.n) She also lived for a 
time in their marital home (in State 1) with her nephew while he was overseas, after 
they separated. The home later became “repossessed.”  (Tr. 40-45; GE 1) 
   
 In addition to his first divorce, Applicant blamed various circumstances related to 
his life and work overseas for his financial woes, and his failure to address them more 
actively. This included an unfavorable exchange rate, and an expensive consumer 
economy at his overseas location. After the hearing, Applicant also stated, for the first 
time, that during his time overseas, his mother became ill and passed away, and as a 
result, he incurred additional unexpected expenses. (AE D) As a result, his debts 
“snowballed” and he fell behind. (Tr. 45-53) 
 
Applicant also indicated that his overseas location had unreliable mail service as 
well as poor phone and internet communications. These factors, he claimed, hindered 
his ability to monitor his credit and to address his debts more promptly. (Tr. 40, 45-53) 
His plan, therefore, was to reach out to his creditors and to attempt to pay his debts 
when he was back in the United States on leave. He testified, however, that the 
pressures of his overseas mission made this difficult. (Tr. 47, 54)  
 
Neither the pressures of his mission nor the expenses of living overseas, 
however, prevented him from making several other foreign trips. (Tr. 33-35, 77-81; GE 1 
at 29-31) Applicant was also in the United States on business, if briefly, in April 2017, 
but he took no action to resolve his debts. (Tr. 88-89) 
 
Applicant testified that the hearing was an “eye opener.” (Tr. 105) However, he  
acknowledged reporting some of his debts on his December 2014 SCA, discussing 
them during his May 2015 background interview, and admitted most of the debts in his 
June 2016 SOR response. (Tr. 89-96) Nevertheless, Applicant took no action towards 
resolving any of his debts until the day before the hearing. As he acknowledged, “I 
haven’t done anything,” and that he had “no excuse for it.” (Tr. 46, 47)  
 
                                                          
9 GE 3 and GE 6 both list SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p and 1.q.  
 
 
6 
 
 
At hearing, Applicant also acknowledged that he had yet to file his 2016 federal 
income tax return, nor had he filed an extension. (Tr. 55-57) After the hearing, Applicant 
indicated that his accountant had filed his 2016 state and federal income tax returns, 
that he did not owe any federal taxes, and that he was owed a small state tax refund. 
(AE D) His tax issues are not alleged in the SOR. 
 
Applicant testified that in July 2017 (after the hearing date was set) he took out a 
$25,000 loan from his employer’s 401(k) plan for repaying his debts. He testified that he 
was not aware that this option was available to him as a way to pay his debts. (Tr. 47, 
59-63, 74, 87) 
 
 Applicant testified that he earns about $70,000 a year in salary. This includes a 
5% cost of living adjustment because he lives in an expensive location overseas. He 
also earns a military pension, bringing his annual income up to about $80,000. Because 
he works overseas, Applicant’s auto expenses are covered by his employer, and he 
also gets a housing allowance, which is also part of his taxable income. He testified that 
he typically has about $1,200 left over each month. He currently has between $5,000 
and $6,000 in savings, and about $150,000 in his 401(k) plan (after the $25,000 loan). 
(Tr. 40-41, 47, 54-63, 73-75, 87; AE D) 
 
 Applicant submitted updated information, and some documents, after the 
hearing. This included an updated answer to the SOR, detailing his post-hearing actions 
to resolve his debts. (AE E) SOR ¶ 1.m was paid, on October 9, 2017. (Tr. 85-87; AE J) 
 
 In AE E, Applicant asserted that he had paid half of the amounts owed for SOR 
¶¶ 1.h and 1.k on October 13, 2017, and would pay the remainder a week later. He 
asserted that he had made a similar arrangement (one payment of $2,500 made, and a 
payment of $2,493 to be made) for SOR ¶ 1.i. He asserted that SOR ¶¶ 1.n ($3,884), 
1.o ($2,401) and 1.p ($537) had been paid in full. He provided no corroborating 
documentation. He did not indicate that any of the other debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 
1.l, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t and 1.u) had been paid. (AE E) Applicant asserted that he had paid 
almost $19,000 towards his SOR debts since the hearing, and would be paying almost 
an additional $7,000 more on October 20, 2017, for a total of almost $26,000. (AE D) 
 
 Applicant also stated, “I have re-enrolled in college, which gives me an additional 
$1,500 a month, all of which will be used to eliminate the rest of the debt more quickly.” 
(AE D) He did not explain how it might be appropriate to take money related to college 
enrollment and to use it instead on paying his delinquent debts.  
 
 Applicant’s supervisor attested to his value as an employee. Applicant has 
supported U.S. Army field artillery units in combat situations during five deployments. 
He has expertise in leading personnel and ensuring proper equipment maintenance. He 
is a trusted and loyal employee who is respected by his supervisors and co-workers. 
(AE F)

Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.10 As the 
Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”11 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible

Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  .  .  . 
 
The financial considerations guideline sets forth several conditions that could 
raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators; and  
 
(f)  . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant has accrued over $66,000 in delinquent debt over the last several 
years. He has remained gainfully employed in the defense industry since retiring from 
the Army in 2006. He makes about $70,000 to $80,000 annually, from his job and his 
Army pension, and he has about $150,000 in a company 401(k) account – funds he 
used after the hearing to begin paying his numerous delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(b), 19(c), and 19(e) apply.  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b and 1.c relate to overdue county property taxes, rather than 
income taxes. Thus, AG ¶ 19(f) does not technically apply. Nevertheless these debts 
(which are proven by the Government’s credit reports) satisfy the more general 
disqualifying conditions noted above.  
 
 
9 
 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are set 
forth under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and   
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
 Applicant did not establish that any of his debts occurred due to circumstances 
beyond his control. Some of his debts may well stem from his first divorce. But his first 
marriage ended in 2011, and he has been gainfully employed, with ample income and 
assets, ever since. Even if he incurred unexpected expenses, for things such as his 
mother’s illness and funeral, Applicant did not establish that he acted reasonably under 
the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) does not fully apply.  
  
 Applicant’s debts stem from his prior life in the United States, and he essentially 
left those debts behind when he moved overseas, taking no action to resolve them until 
confronted with the reality of his hearing. Applicant had access to ample funds with 
which to pay his debts, yet took no action. He remained gainfully employed during the 
entire period. Applicant asserted that several factors kept him from addressing his debts 
more actively. This included the needs of his mission, the purported mail, internet and 
communication difficulties at his overseas location, and living in an expensive location 
(where he nevertheless has a car and housing both provided by his employer). Despite 
all this, Applicant travels widely. Applicant’s protestations about his difficulties in 
addressing his debts from overseas are not credible.  
 
 Shortly before the hearing, Applicant took out a $25,000 loan from his 401(k), for 
paying his numerous debts. He provided one document (AE J) showing one of them 
 
10 
 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.m) was paid in October 2017. After the hearing, he indicated that several 
other debts had been paid, but did not provide corroborating documentation. Even if he 
had provided such evidence, his efforts are far too little, far too late, to establish a good 
faith effort to repay his numerous debts. AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply.12 
  
 I find that SOR ¶ 1.t is a duplicate of ¶ 1.s. Applicant testified that he had only 
one account with the cell phone company, an account he had not had for several years. 
It is likely that the two accounts ($1 apart) are one account, listed twice on his credit 
reports. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to SOR ¶ 1.t.  
 
 Applicant went to the county tax office to resolve the liens related to his father’s 
business (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c) and provided related documentation. AG ¶ 20(g) 
applies. The business is now closed, so these debts are also unlikely to recur.  
 
 Applicant’s outstanding financial delinquencies are a “continuing course of 
conduct.”13 They are significant, ongoing and unresolved. Applicant did not provide 
sufficient evidence to establish that the behavior which led to his delinquencies 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, 
trustworthiness and reliability. Except as to the tax debts, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and

circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Withdrawn 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.s:    Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.t:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.u:     Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. Eligibility for continued access to classified 
information is denied.
