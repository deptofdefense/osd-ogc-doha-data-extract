FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 14, 2015. 
On October 16, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.1 
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines for all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. The changes resulting 
from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2016, and requested a decision on 
the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written 
case on December 6, 2016. On December 7, 2016, a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 4, was sent to Applicant, who was given 
an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. He received the FORM on December 12, 2016, and he 
submitted additional documents, which are included in the record as Item 5. The case 
was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
The FORM included Item 3, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) 
conducted on June 25, 2015. The PSI was not authenticated as required by Directive ¶ 
E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to comment on the 
accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or 
object to consideration of the PSI on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant 
submitted a response to the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy or completeness 
of the PSI summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived any objections to 
the PSI summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they 
are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the 
Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2012 through 2015. In answer to the SOR, he did not expressly admit 
or deny the allegations, but he submitted a letter from a certified public accountant (CPA) 
stating that he was in the process of preparing the tax returns for 2012 through 2015.  
 
 Applicant is a 38-year-old security engineer employed by a defense contractor 
since March 2015. He graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in August 2002. 
He married in January 2011, and he has three children. He previously was employed by 
defense contractors from December 2005 to February 2006 and from September 2006 
until he began his current job. He was unemployed from February to September 2006. In 
his SCA, he stated that he lost his job in February 2006 because “the investigation for the 
clearance was cancelled.” (Item 1 at 14.) He has never held a security clearance. 
 
 When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he had failed to file his 
federal and city income tax returns for 2012 and 2013. He attributed his failures to file to 
procrastination. He owed no federal taxes, but he owed about $150 in city taxes, which 
he paid before submitting his SCA. The delinquent city taxes are not alleged in the SOR. 
 
 In the August 2015 PSI, Applicant admitted failing to file his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2012 through 2014. He again attributed his failures to timely file his 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (Item 2) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

tax returns to procrastination. He stated that he had an extension until October 2015 to 
file his federal and state income tax returns. (Item 3 at 5.)  
 
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted copies of his federal and state 
tax returns for 2012 through 2015, along with certified mail receipts for the 2012 and 2013 
returns. He stated that the returns for 2014 and 2015 had been electronically filed. All his 
past-due returns were filed in December 2016. For 2012, he claimed a $1,613 refund of 
federal taxes and a $295 state refund. The second page of his federal return for 2013, 
containing the CPA’s signature and reflecting the amount of the federal refund, is missing 
from his submission. His 2013 state return reflects a claimed refund of $295. For 2014, 
he claimed a federal refund of $1,134 and a state refund of $463. For 2015, he claimed 
a federal refund of $4,545 and a state refund of $740.   
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance.

 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2012 through 2015, as required. The security concern under this 
guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns establishes 
two disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”) 
and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
 
5 
 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required”). The 
following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s failures to timely file his tax returns were 
recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur or 
because of conditions largely beyond his control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is established. However, Applicant’s eventual compliance with his tax 
obligations does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-
enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns “does not preclude 
careful consideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility.” ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). 
Furthermore, the establishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable 
security-clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014).  
 
In this case, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state returns for four 
consecutive tax years. He blamed his past-due returns on procrastination and offered no 
other explanation. He did not rectify his tax situation until December 2016, after receiving 
the SOR and realizing that his past-due returns raised security concerns. A person who 
fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree 
of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961) 
 
Whole-Person Analysis 
 
 The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, an 
administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by 
considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An 
 
6 
 
administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(d).3  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Applicant submitted no evidence of the 
quality of his performance in his current job. He submitted no evidence, other than the tax 
returns reflecting his income, of his financial stability. Because he requested a 
determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his 
credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. 
Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based on the evidence in the record, including the evidence submitted 
by Applicant, I conclude that he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his 
failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.

3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.
