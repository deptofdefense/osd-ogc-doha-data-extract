DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file and pay Federal and state income taxes for years 
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. He also accumulated debts during that time, 
some of which remain delinquent. He failed to disclose many financial problems in his 
security clearance application. Resulting security concerns were not mitigated. National 
security eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On April 24, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal 
Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information, (AG) effective within the DOD for SORs issued after 
September 1, 2006; and the AG effective within the DOD for SORs issued after June 8,

2017.1  
 
 On May 21, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.) A complete copy of the 
Government’s File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, was mailed to 
Applicant on July 18, 2016, and received by him on July 25, 2016. The FORM notified 
Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant timely 
submitted documents that he labeled as Items A through H. I marked his cover letter for 
those submissions as Item I. He also resubmitted the Government’s Items 1 through 8, 
with comments. Those exhibits are labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 8. 
Department Counsel did not object to Applicant’s submissions. All Items and exhibits are 
admitted into evidence. On May 22, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) assigned the case to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.p, and 1.r. He denied 
all other allegations, except that in SOR ¶ 1.q, which he neither admitted nor denied. His 
answer to that allegation will be construed as a denial. (Item 1.) 
 
 Applicant is 56 years old and married since 1997. They have one adult child. 
Applicant holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree. He served on active duty with the Air 
Force from 1978 to 2002, when he retired as a major. He held a security clearance during 
his service and subsequent to it. (Item 2.) He earned personal awards during his service. 
He was awarded an Air Medal for combat missions. (Item H.)  
 
 In January 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for re-investigation. In it, he disclosed that he failed to 
file Federal income tax returns and pay owed taxes for years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. 
He estimated that he owed $40,000 for each year, totaling about $200,000. (Item 2.) He 
did not disclose any information about his unfiled or unpaid state taxes, including state 
tax liens filed in 2007 and 2008 and unfiled state tax returns for 2004 and 2005. He did 
not disclose an automobile repossession in 2011 or other delinquent debts. (Item 2.) 
 
 During an interview in April 2013 with a government investigator, Applicant 
discussed his background and information in his e-QIP. Since 2008, he has been self-
employed, working full-time as an independent consultant for defense contractors. He 
explained that he did not file or pay federal taxes for 2008 through 2011 because he did 
not pay estimated quarterly self-employment taxes during those years; he also 
experienced a loss of income for a period of time. After being confronted by the 
investigator, he acknowledged that he had state tax liens filed in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 
2008. He said he did not disclose the 2004 and 2005 tax liens because they were outside 
                                                 
1I considered the previous AG, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AG, effective June 8, 2017. 
My decision would be the same under either set of guidelines.

of the 7-year limitation stated in the question. He voluntarily discussed his unfiled state 
tax returns for 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and taxes owed for those years. He stated 
his lawyer was working on the tax problems and resolving all outstanding returns, taxes, 
and liens. He said his failure to disclose information about his state tax issues was an 
oversight. When confronted with delinquent credit accounts, Applicant again stated that 
his failure to disclose them was his oversight, and he was unaware of some. (Item 5; AE 
1.) 
 
 Applicant’s wife submitted a letter stating that her erratic spending and gambling 
created their financial and tax problems. She said Applicant should not be held 
responsible for her mistakes. (Item 1.) 
 
 Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from January 
2013, April 2015, and July 2016, the SOR contained allegations related to timely filing 
and paying Federal and state income taxes, and delinquent debts. These allegations 
arose between 2006 and 2015. (Item 6, Item 7, Item 8.) The status of the SOR allegations 
is as follows: 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: In December 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien 
against Applicant for $263,000. (Item 8.) During that same month, the IRS accepted a 
partial payment installment agreement for tax periods 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013. 
The total tax liability was listed as $372,445. Applicant was required to begin making 
monthly payments of $468 on January 28, 2015. (Item 5.) In his May 2016 answer to the 
SOR, Applicant submitted a November 2015 letter from the IRS regarding his installment 
agreement, and included a billing summary as of November 18, 2015. As of that date, 
Applicant owed $373,845 for those years, which amount included failure to pay penalties 
and additional interest. (Item 1.) According to an IRS account transcript for 2008, 
Applicant made monthly payments of $468 from December 2015 through July 2016, 
seemingly on that agreement. (AE B.) Applicant will continue to make those payments 
until 2024. (AE 1.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: The four tax liens filed by State 1 between 2013 and 
2014 were paid and released in September 2015. The tax years underlying these liens 
are not listed. (Item 1.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g: These two tax liens filed by State 2 between 2007 and 2008 
are unresolved. The tax years for the liens are not listed. (Item 1.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: Applicant is unfamiliar with this $578 delinquent debt, but thinks it may 
be an account his wife opened without his knowledge. (AE 1, AE 7.) It is unresolved.   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: Applicant paid this $502 delinquent debt. (Item 8.) It is resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j: Applicant is unfamiliar with this $473 delinquent debt, but thinks it may 
be an account his wife opened without his knowledge. (AE 1, AE 7.) It is unresolved.   
 
 
4 
 
 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.k: Applicant paid this $344 delinquent debt. (Item 8.) It is resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l: Applicant stated that he paid this $502 delinquent debt, but the credit 
report has not reported it yet. (AE 1.) It is resolved.   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m: Applicant is unfamiliar with this $472 delinquent debt, but thinks it may 
be an account his wife opened without his knowledge. (AE 1, AE 7.) It is unresolved.   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.n: Applicant paid this $27,576 delinquent debt for a repossessed car. 
(Item 6.) It is resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o: Applicant paid this $344 delinquent debt. (Item 9.) It is resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p: Applicant submitted IRS account transcripts for tax years 2008, 2009, 
2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. All of his Federal tax returns for those years were filed late. 
(Item B.) 
    
 SOR ¶ 1.q: Applicant failed to timely file State 2 income tax returns for tax years 
2004 and 2005. (AE 1.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.r: Applicant failed to timely file State 1 income tax returns for tax year 
2011. (AE 1.)  
 
 Applicant did not provide evidence of financial or credit counseling. According to 
the IRS, Applicant reported an adjusted gross income of $165,626 for 2007; $141,561 for 
2008; $165,816 for 2009; $193,060 for 2010; $218,796 for 2011; $224,890 for 2012; 
$226,752 for 2013; and $228,499 for $2014. (Item B.) In July 2015, Applicant received an 
inheritance of $431,000 from his father’s estate, which he used to pay taxes, credit card 
bills, and living expenses for six months in 2015 when his work was unsteady. (Item 5.) 
He did not provide a budget from which to predict responsible management of his finances 
or continued payments of his taxes and any outstanding debts. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for national security eligibility, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant’s eligibility for a position of 
trust. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire 
 
 
5 
 
 
process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of 
variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.  
 
 Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “[t]he applicant 
is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
 
 A person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national 
security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
 
 Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865: “[a]ny determination under this 
order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest 
and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” 
See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified 
or sensitive information.) 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
 
 
6 
 
 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for years 2008 through 
2013. He failed to timely pay Federal income taxes for those years, despite earning high 
salaries. He failed to timely pay state income taxes for six years during that time frame. 
He also accumulated delinquent debts that he has been unwilling to fully resolve. The 
evidence raises the above security concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to 
rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  
 
 The guideline includes five conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial problems: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
 
 
7 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant owes unpaid Federal taxes for six years: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 
and 2013. His tax problems have been ongoing since 2008 and continue to cast doubt on 
his reliability. Some delinquent debts remain unresolved. Based on the extent of this 
problem, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that similar problems will not recur. AG 
¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
 Applicant’s tax problems arose because he failed to file quarterly estimated taxes 
as a self-employed individual. Those circumstances were within his control and 
responsibility. He did not begin to address his Federal tax issues until December 2014. 
His wife’s gambling problems may have been beyond his control for a period of time; 
however, at some point during those years, he should have become aware of her 
gambling habits, and taken actions to responsibly manage their taxes and debts. There 
is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b).    
 
 Applicant did not submit evidence that he participated in credit or financial 
counseling. He did not submit evidence proving that the state tax liens from 2004 and 
2005 are resolved. His IRS payment plan will continue until 2024, which indicates the 
magnitude of his unpaid taxes. Some delinquent debts remain unresolved. There are not 
clear indications that his financial obligations are sufficiently under control to establish 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c).  
 
 Applicant resolved four state tax liens in 2015 and paid six delinquent debts 
subsequently. Those actions demonstrated a partial good-faith effort to resolve the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p, and established some 
evidence of mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) as to those debts. In January 2015, he started 
making payments on six years of unpaid Federal taxes that totaled over $311,000. At this 
time, he has not established a sufficient track record of making payments or significant 
decrease in the amount owed to warrant full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g) for his unpaid 
Federal taxes.  
 
Guideline E: Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
 
 
8 
 
 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
 
AG ¶ 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
 Applicant denied that he deliberately failed to disclose all unpaid taxes and unfiled 
returns, and other negative financial problems in his January 2013 e-QIP. While the state 
tax liens issued in March 2013 and December 2015 had not been filed when he submitted 
his e-QIP, he knew that he had not filed or paid state taxes underlying those liens. His 
defense that his failure to disclose requested financial information was an oversight, is 
not credible, given the amount of information he left out of his e-QIP. He deliberately failed 
to disclose requested information. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying 
condition.  
 
AG ¶ 17 provides two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised 
under this guideline:  
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under either of the above 
mitigating conditions. Applicant did not make prompt efforts to correct all omissions on 
his January 2013 e-QIP during his April 2013 interview. The investigator, noted more than 
once, that he confronted Applicant about negative financial information that had not been 
disclosed. Although Applicant specifically disclosed unfiled Federal returns and unpaid 
taxes for years 2008 through 2011, he did not disclose prior unfiled returns and unpaid 
state tax liens, a repossession with a significant balance, or any of the multiple delinquent 
debts. His non-disclosure is a major offense and casts doubt on his good judgment. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct 
 
 
9 
 
 
and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national 
security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 56-year-old man 
and retired military officer, who honorably served his country. Since leaving the service, 
he has successfully worked for defense contractors. That mitigating evidence weighs in 
favor of granting Applicant a security clearance in the whole-person analysis. However, 
the facts against granting him a security clearance are significant and outweigh those 
facts. For six years or more, Applicant failed to responsibly manage his taxes and 
finances. There is evidence that he did not begin to seriously address those issues until 
after he submitted his January 2013 e-QIP and was interviewed in April 2013. His unpaid 
Federal taxes will not be resolved until 2024, despite years of earning a high salary and 
receiving a large inheritance. The scope of his financial mismanagement is extensive. His 
lack of forthrightness during the security clearance process is also concerning. Applicant’s 
actions to date are not sufficient to outweigh a history of non-compliance with a 
fundamental legal obligation to file and pay taxes. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with these things is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). 
Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of 
those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).2  
   
                                                 
2 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). 
 
 
10 
 
 
The record evidence leaves me with serious questions as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:               AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph: 1.a:                                Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b through 1.e:          For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.h:          Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:                      For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:                      Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l:          For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:                      Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n and 1.o:          For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p through 1.r:          Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:              AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs: 2.a and 2.b:        Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
