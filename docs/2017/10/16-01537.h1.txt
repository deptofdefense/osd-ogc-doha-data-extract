Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his 
use of marijuana and cocaine and his personal conduct. Accordingly, this case is decided 
against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on June 2, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On November 2, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudication Guidelines (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
2 
 
the action under the security guidelines known as Guideline H for drug involvement and 
substance misuse and Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR 
on November 23, 2016, and requested a decision based on the written record without a 
hearing.   
 
On January 11, 2017, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on the next day. He was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on February 14, 2017.3 Applicant 
did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were 13 items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 and are admitted into evidence without objection.4  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 39 years old, a high school graduate, who has never married, and has 
two sons ages 11 and 2. Since February 2013, he has worked for a defense contractor.5 
 
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) was terminated by his 
employer in May 2011 for testing positive for cocaine; (2) used cocaine from January 
2007 to May 2011; (3) used marijuana from 1991 to 1999; and (3) was arrested and 
charged with drug offenses three times in 1996 and once in 2007.6 Applicant admitted 
those allegations.7  
 
 
                                                          
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My decision and 
formal findings under the revised Guidelines H and E would not be different under the 2006 Guidelines.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated January 12 20-17, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated February 14, 2017. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 
30 days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first four items of the FORM are the SOR, the Transmittal Letter, Applicant’s Receipt, and Applicant’s 
Answer, respectively. Because the SOR and the Answer are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked 
as Exhibits. The Transmittal Letter and Applicant’s Receipt have no substantive value and, therefore, they 
are not marked as exhibits. Items 5 through 13 are marked as Exhibits 1 through 9.

6 SOR ¶¶ 1.a-g.  
 
7Answer ¶¶ 1.a-g and pp. 4-5.

Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) deliberately failed to 
disclose in his June 2015 security clearance application the information alleged under 
Guideline H in the SOR; and (2) deliberately failed to be honest about his drug use during 
his background interviews in 2011 and 2015 and in his August 2016 responses to DOHA 
interrogatories.8 Applicant admitted those allegations. He also admitted that he was not 
honest during the clearance process, because he needed a clearance in order to get the 
job he wanted.9 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.10 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”11 Under Egan, E.O. 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an 
applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of 
protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.12 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.13 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.14 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.15 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.16 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.17 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.18 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.19 
 
      Discussion 
 
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse 
 
 Under AG H for drug use,20 suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put 
into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a 
person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations: 
 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription 
and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause 
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their 
intended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and 
trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or 
psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's 
ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled 
substance means any "controlled substance" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. 
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any 
of the behaviors listed above. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying   
conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); 
 
 AG ¶ 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and,  
 
AG ¶ 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug 
paraphernalia.

 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.   
 
Applicant admitted his use of marijuana from 1991 to 1999, his use of cocaine from 
January 2007 to May 2011, and that he was terminated from his employment in May 2011 
after testing positive for cocaine. He also admitted that he was arrested and charged with 
drug offenses in 1996 and 2007. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to a 
Statement of Reasons require no further proof by the Government.21 Marijuana is a 
Schedule I controlled substance, and cocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance, the 
possession of which is regulated by the federal government under the Controlled 
Substances Act.22 The knowing or intentional possession and use of any controlled 
substance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment and or a fine.23 AG ¶¶ 25(a), (b), 
and (c) apply. 
 
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). It is true that Applicant’s illegal drug 
use occurred a number of years ago and ceased in May 2011. There was, however, a 
fairly lengthy period of time, when he was a frequent user of illegal drugs, with sufficient 
frequency to be arrested and charged with drug offenses. Thus, I cannot find that the 
behavior was infrequent. In addition, I must view the record as a whole, not in a piecemeal 
fashion.24 In this case, Applicant’s admitted falsifications during the clearance process, 
discussed below, impacts negatively on my ruling under Guideline H. AG ¶ 26(a) does 
not apply.  
 
Guideline E – Personal Conduct 
 
 Under Guideline E for personal conduct, the concern is that “[c]onduct involving 
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified or sensitive information.”25 A statement is false or dishonest 
when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission of relevant and material 
                                                          
21 ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR 
allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 
(App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal 
basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).

information is not deliberate if, for example, the person genuinely forgot about it, 
inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, reasonably did not know the 
information, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be reported. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying 
conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts 
from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or 
award fiduciary responsibilities; and,  
 
AG ¶ 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing 
or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, 
security official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in 
making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, 
or other official government representative. 
 In assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the 
allegation and applicant’s answer but all relevant circumstances.26 Here, the SOR alleged 
that Applicant deliberately failed to fully disclose his marijuana and cocaine use in his 
security clearance application, during his background interviews, and in responses to 
DOHA interrogatories. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was not 
forthcoming with relevant, requested information, attributing his dishonesty to fear of not 
getting the job he wanted. This is a classic case of the motive to obtain a job driving an 
applicant to be dishonest during the clearance process. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and (b) apply, and 
there is nothing in the record mitigating Applicant’s personal conduct under Guideline E.  
 
 The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, 
and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the 
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.27 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     Against Applicant

  Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.g:              Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
