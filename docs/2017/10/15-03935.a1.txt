APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On   
April 5, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On August 1, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant’s request for
a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant has not raised an issue of harmful error by the Judge.  He states that if he had
requested a hearing he would have been better able to explain his circumstances.  He admits that he
was not familiar with the process, but he did not attribute this lack of understanding to any
deficiency in the Guidance that he received from DOHA.  Applicant requests that we permit him to
submit new evidence.  However, we are not permitted to receive or consider new evidence on
appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  We do not review cases de novo.  Our scope of review is limited to
cases in which the appealing party raises an issue of harmful error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-
01834 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2017).  There being none, the decision is AFFIRMED.
