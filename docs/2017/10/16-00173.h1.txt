HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has an unpaid judgment against him for $29,637. He failed to timely file 
his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013. He did not timely file 
his state tax return for tax year 2010. He has substantial unpaid federal income taxes 
from tax years 2006 and 2010. He did not establish his financial responsibility. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is 
denied.        
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On May 10, 2015, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1. On February 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs). Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. The SOR set forth security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
On March 23, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. HE 3. On April 25, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 
 
2 
                                         
 
2, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On May 9, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 14, 2017. 
HE 1. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.   
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant offered 
five exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. Transcript (Tr.) 19-24; GE 1-7; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-E. On June 27, 2017, 
DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript. On July 11, 2017, Applicant provided six 
documents, which were admitted without objection. AE F-AE K. The record closed on July 
13, 2017. Tr. 102. 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.i, and 1.n, and he 
denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings 
of fact follow.

1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.

Applicant said he did not have any income for tax years 2011 and 2014, and he 
did not file tax returns for those years. Tr. 39-40, 40, 42, 48. The income threshold for 
filing a federal tax return in 2012 for a single person under age 65 was $9,750.4 He said 
his employer paid his expenses in 2014, and he did not count those payments as income. 
Tr. 40. He did not indicate the amount of his expenses.  
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2010, 2012, and

the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2010, and he knew he would not receive 
a refund. Tr. 44. He “honestly just blew it off.” Tr. 44.  
 
Applicant contacted the IRS twice. Tr. 44-45; SOR response. The first time the IRS 
advised him that he owed more than $30,000 for tax year 2010, and he was unable to 
afford payments. Tr. 45. The second time the IRS advised him he needed to file the tax 
returns that were overdue before a payment plan could be established. Tr. 45. He was 
also unable to file because his former spouse took Applicant’s documentation from his 
storage unit. Tr. 45. When he tried to contact her about his documentation, she would not 
communicate with him. Tr. 46. He told the IRS about lacking documentation to file his tax 
return, and the IRS advised him he still needed to file his tax returns. Tr. 47. The IRS was 
not seeking to levy his bank account or pay, and so he “blew if off again.” Tr. 47. 
 
Applicant said he failed to timely file his state tax return for tax year 2010; however, 
he timely filed his state tax returns for the other years. Tr. 53; SOR ¶ 1.b; GE 3. Applicant’s 
SOR alleges a delinquent state tax debt of $4,283 (SOR ¶ 1.d), two state tax liens filed

lien filed against him in 2014 for $5,734 (SOR ¶ 1.h). Applicant believed his partner in the 
construction business paid the state tax liens, and they were released. Tr. 63; GE 2, 3.

owed on his state tax debt for 2011 is $4,284. Tr. 52-56, 70; GE 2. He did not make any 
payments from April 2016 to December 2016 because he was unemployed, and he 
resumed making $120 monthly payments towards his state tax debt in January 2017. Tr. 
68, 70-71. He owes $160 to the state tax authority for the 2016 tax year. AE E at 1.

configured, and his priority and secured debts will be paid, if he completes the payment 
plan. Tr. 94. After the current plan is completed, his unsecured nonpriority debts will be 
discharged.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k allege an apartment complex placed two debts for collection 
for $2,011 and $1,885. Actually, Applicant owed only one debt to the apartment complex. 
Applicant settled the debt for $1,042, and he provided a letter from the creditor indicating

5 Applicant’s SOR does not include information about his delinquent child-support debt and several 
debts in his bankruptcy filing. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board 
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
 
7 
                                         
 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
 
8 
                                         
 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
The record establishes AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  
 
Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,6 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;7   
                                            
6 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant’s periods of unemployment and underemployment and his divorce were 
outside his control and adversely affected his finances. He is credited with mitigating the 
following SOR allegations: ¶ 1.d because he has a history of making payments to address 
his state tax debt; ¶ 1.c because it is a duplication of SOR ¶ 1.e; ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h 
because the state tax liens were paid; SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k are duplications of the same 
debt, and Applicant settled the debt for $1,042; ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m because Applicant did not 
recognize the debts; and ¶ 1.n because he said he made some payments. SOR ¶ 1.i is a 
judgment for $29,637, and Applicant is not credited with mitigating this debt because he 
did not show any progress resolving this debt.     
 
Applicant’s action to resolve his debts utilizing Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code 
is a positive financial development. The website for U.S. Courts explains the basics for a 
chapter 13 bankruptcy: 
 
A chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a wage earner’s plan. It enables 
individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their 
debts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make 
                                            
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

installments to creditors over three to five years. If the debtor's current 
monthly income is less than the applicable state median, the plan will be for 
three years unless the court approves a longer period "for cause." (1) If the 
debtor’s current monthly income is greater than the applicable state median, 
the plan generally must be for five years. In no case may a plan provide for 
payments over a period longer than five years. 11 U.S.C. § 1322(d). During 
this time the law forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection 
efforts. 
 
*  *  * 
 
The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor. 11 
U.S.C. § 1327. Once the court confirms the plan, the debtor must make the 
plan succeed. The debtor must make regular payments to the trustee either 
directly or through payroll deduction, which will require adjustment to living 
on a fixed budget for a prolonged period. Furthermore, while confirmation 
of the plan entitles the debtor to retain property as long as payments are 
made, the debtor may not incur new debt without consulting the trustee, 
because additional debt may compromise the debtor's ability to complete 
the plan. 11 U.S.C. §§ 1305(c), 1322(a)(1), 1327.  
 
A debtor may make plan payments through payroll deductions. This practice 
increases the likelihood that payments will be made on time and that the 
debtor will complete the plan. In any event, if the debtor fails to make the 
payments due under the confirmed plan, the court may dismiss the case or 
convert it to a liquidation case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 
U.S.C. § 1307(c). The court may also dismiss or convert the debtor's case 
if the debtor fails to pay any post-filing domestic support obligations (i.e., 
child support, alimony), or fails to make required tax filings during the case. 
11 U.S.C. §§ 1307(c) and (e), 1308, 521.8 
 
Applicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. 
His bankruptcy repayment plan was developed under the supervision of the bankruptcy 
court after assessing his income, ability to pay, and debts.   
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 2010, 2012, 
and 2013. He filed those tax returns on January 9, 2017. He did not timely file his state 
tax return for tax year 2010. He has substantial unpaid federal income taxes from tax 
years 2006 and 2010. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the 
IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.9 For

9 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such

purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal 
income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely file 
federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
                                            
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without 
regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 
479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United 
States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). Applicant was 
scheduled to begin making payments to the bankruptcy trustee in July 2017, one month 
after his hearing. In turn, the bankruptcy trustee will make payments to the IRS, state tax 
authority, and other priority creditors, including to address his child-support arrearage. 
AG ¶ 20(g) does not fully apply because it is too soon to know whether Applicant will 
make the necessary payments to the bankruptcy trustee.   
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress sooner resolving his tax issues and insufficient assurance his financial problems 
are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
13 
                                         
 
Applicant is 40 years old, and DOD contractors have employed him as a 
maintenance technician for two years. He attended college; however, he has not received 
a degree. He was married from 2005 to 2010. He married his current spouse in 2015. He 
has one son, who is serving in the U.S. Navy, and a three-year-old son with his current 
spouse. He served in the Air Force from 1994 to 2000, and he was a senior airman when 
he received an honorable discharge. Applicant’s spouse does not work outside their 
home. Underemployment, unemployment, and divorce were circumstances beyond 
Applicant’s control that harmed his finances. He received financial counseling, and in 
June 2017, he filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. The 
bankruptcy court scheduled his first payment of $1,700 for July 2017, the month after his 
hearing.   
 
Applicant’s family has a strong military tradition with Applicant’s great grandfather 
serving in World War I, his grandfather serving in World War II, and his father serving in 
the Air Force for 24 years to retirement. Applicant loves his work for DOD, and he loves 
the United States. He promised to protect national security and to pay his creditors. He 
wants to continue to contribute to DOD.  
 
The evidence against grant of his security clearance is more substantial. Applicant 
has an unpaid judgment for $29,637. He failed to timely file his federal income tax returns 
for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013. He filed those tax returns on January 9, 2017. He did 
not timely file his state tax return for tax year 2010. He has substantial unpaid federal 
income taxes for tax years 2006 and 2010. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative 
judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, 
whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax 
debt arises to begin and complete making payments.10 The primary problem here is that 
                                            
10 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his 
children’s college tuition and expenses, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized 
“the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure 
to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government 
rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security 
clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. 
 
14 
                                         
 
Applicant has known that he needed to file federal income tax returns for several years, 
and he waited until January 9, 2017 to file his tax returns. His filing of all unfiled tax returns 
on January 9, 2017, and his filing of Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2017 is too little, too 
late to mitigate security concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able 
to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j through 1.n: For Applicant   
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
