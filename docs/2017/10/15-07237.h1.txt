FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 21, 2015. On 
September 29, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on 
September 1, 2006.1  
  
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines. The SEAD 4 guidelines apply to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 
8, 2017. The changes resulting from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on October 26, 2017, and requested a decision on 
the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written 
case on November 28, 2016. On December 1, 2016, a complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 4, was sent to Applicant, who 
was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the Government’s evidence. He received the FORM on December 8, 2016, and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The case 
was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g and 
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. His admission is incorporated in 
my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old software developer employed by a defense contractor 
since August 2010. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in May 
1995. He married in October 1998, and he has an 18-year-old daughter and two 
stepsons, ages 32 and 34. He has worked for defense contractors since April 2005, 
except for a period of unemployment from October 2009 to January 2010. He has held 
a security clearance since January 2007.  
 
 The SOR alleges five delinquent credit-card accounts referred for collection of 
$11,725 (SOR ¶ 1.a); $9,758 (SOR ¶ 1.b); $4,065 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $1,782 (SOR ¶ 1.d); 
and $9,462 (SOR ¶ 1.e), and a delinquent medical bill for $1,347 (SOR ¶ 1.f). It also 
alleges that Applicant filed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2009 (SOR ¶ 
1.g); and that he owed about $6,229 in federal income taxes and $2,294 in state income 
taxes for tax year 2012, but he did not begin making payments on them until 2015. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i). The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f are reflected in a credit report 
from May 2015. (Item 4.) He disclosed the federal and state tax delinquencies alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i in his SCA. (Item 2 at 40-41.) 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems began when he was laid off in October 2009. He 
found work as an independent consultant in January 2010, earning about the same pay 
as he earned before being laid off. However, in August 2010, he became a direct-hire, 
full-time employee and took a 20% pay cut. Applicant and his wife sold the family home 
in a short sale in March 2011, but still could not generate enough income to pay their 
debts. He hired a debt-management company to assist him, but he terminated the 
contract after a short time because the company was not providing enough assistance 
to justify the fees it was charging. After the short sale, he neglected to adjust his tax 
withholding, and he had insufficient funds withheld to pay the federal income taxes due 
for tax year 2009 and the state income taxes for 2008.  
 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (Item 2) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c on the 
ground that they were charged off in October and November 2013, as reflected in pages 
2-3 of an October 2016 credit report attached to his answer and the May 2015 credit 
report in the FORM (Item 4). He submitted no evidence that they were paid or otherwise 
resolved.   
 
Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d on the ground that it was paid, 
The October 2016 credit report attached to his answer reflects declining balances each 
month from October 2014 to April 2016 and reflects the status as “Paid. Closed. $5,387 
written off.” This debt is resolved. 
 
Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. He stated that he had not 
received any calls or letters about this debt “for years.” The October 2016 credit report 
reflects that this account was charged off in March 2012 for $9,462. He submitted no 
evidence that the debt was paid or otherwise resolved.  
 
The medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is reflected in the May 2015 and October 
2016 credit reports as referred for collection of $7,862. In Applicant’s answer, he stated 
that the debt may have been paid off, but he submitted no documentary evidence of 
payment. It is not resolved. 
 
Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 
2009, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. He was unable to pay the full amount of the taxes due 
because of insufficient tax withholding during the year. He paid $200 and received an 
extension until October 2010. He then forgot to file the return, because his attention was 
focused on dealing with other financial problems, including a short sale of the family 
residence that was completed in March 2011. After receiving a reminder from the IRS, 
he filed his federal return in September 2011.   
 
Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.h that he did not begin making 
payments on his $6,229 tax debt for 2012 until April 2015. The IRS tax transcript for 
2012 reflected that Applicant owed about $6,300, in addition to tax debts for earlier 
years. He made a payment agreement in June 2013 providing for monthly $240 
payments. The payments were applied to the oldest debt first, and they were not 
applied to the 2012 debt until June 2015, after the tax debts for previous years were 
paid.   
 
Applicant also denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i that he did not begin making 
payments on his $2,294 state tax debt for 2012 until July 2015. The state tax records 
attached to his answer reflect that he made a payment agreement with the state and 
started making monthly $100 payments to the state in June 2012. The payments were 
applied to the oldest tax year first (a tax debt for 2008), and the payments (which had 
increased to $150 per month) were not applied to tax year 2012 until July 2015, after 
the tax debts for previous years were paid.  
 
 
 4
Applicant has not submitted any evidence of his current income and expenses. 
However, the federal tax transcripts attached to his SOR answer reflect that for tax year 
2009, he and his wife filed a joint return and reported an adjusted gross income of 
$137,867. They reported a joint adjusted gross income of $160,432 for tax year 2012 
and $182,411 for tax year 2015. The record contains no information regarding other tax 
years.  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
 5
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The evidence in the FORM is sufficient to establish the following disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”); AG ¶ 19(b) 
(“unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”); AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history 
of not meeting financial obligations”); and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently filing 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax as required”). The following mitigating conditions are potentially 
applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
 
 6
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) are not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are 
numerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to 
recur. He hired a debt management company for a short time, but there is no evidence 
that he received the type of financial counseling contemplated by AG ¶ 20(c). 
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d) are established for the credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d and the tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i. Applicant’s periods of 
unemployment and a subsequent pay reduction were conditions largely beyond his 
control. He made regular payments and eventually resolved the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d. He is making regular payments on the tax debts. However, he submitted no 
evidence of responsible conduct regarding the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 
and 1.f. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is established for the untimely federal income tax return for 2009, 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, and the tax debts alleged SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i. He filed the 2009 
federal return in September 2011. He made payment agreements for the delinquent 
federal and state tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i, and he has complied with 
them. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
 
 7
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct, all relevant 
circumstances, and the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).3  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). I have considered that 
Applicant has worked for defense contractors and held a security clearance for many 
years, apparently without incident. Because he requested a determination on the record 
without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on 
demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing 
the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the 
evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.g-1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is denied.

3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
