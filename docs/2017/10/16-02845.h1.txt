KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on October 18, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On November 15, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
 
2 
 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on December 19, 2016, and requested a decision based on 
the written record without a hearing.   
 
On February 1, 2017, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on February 2, 2017, and he received it on 
February 10, 2017. He was given 30 days to file objections and submit material to refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence.3 Applicant did not respond to the 
FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were seven items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.4 Exhibits 1 and 3 through 5 are admitted into 
evidence without objection. GE 2 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing 
Applicant’s interview that took place during the December 2015 background investigation. 
The ROI is not authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department 
Counsel’s written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not 
authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the authentication 
requirement. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure to respond 
to the FORM, which response is optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary waiver of 
the authentication requirement. The record does not demonstrate that Applicant 
understood the concepts of authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not 
demonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving an objection to the 
admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Exhibit 2 is inadmissible, and I have not considered 
the information in the ROI.    
 
 
                                                          
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My decision and 
formal findings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated February 2, 2017, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated February 10, 2017. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 
30 days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR, and the second item is Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and 
the Answer are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 3 through 7 are marked 
as Exhibits 1 through 5.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 48 years old, a high school graduate, and is married. He has one adult 
stepson, an adult daughter, three sons (ages, 9, 13, and 15), and a daughter (age 7). 
Since September 2015, he has worked for a defense contractor. From November 1997 
until September 2015, he was self-employed.6 
 
The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $37,794, two of which are for 
delinquent state and federal income taxes. The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to 
timely file his federal income tax returns for 2012 and 2013 and failed to file his state 
income tax returns for 2006 through 2008 and for 2010 through 2014.7  
 
Applicant admitted all allegations. Applicant explained in his answer that he was a 
self-employed construction contractor at the time of the 2008 recession, and he was 
unable to keep current with his financial obligations. As to the tax allegations, he 
answered that he had filed all his state and federal income tax returns and that he had 
installment agreements with the IRS and the state. The only documents he attached were 
a December 14, 2016 billing notice from the IRS and a December 9, 2016 state payment 
agreement which shows the balance due and the outstanding income tax bills. Applicant 
did not provide any documents showing a record of actual payments made to the IRS or 
to the state. As to the non-tax debts, Applicant said that once he satisfies his tax 
obligations, he will pay those off “a little at a time.”8 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.9 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”10 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.11 An

unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.12 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.13 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.14 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.15 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.16 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18 
 
     Discussion 
  
  Under Guideline F for financial considerations,19 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.20 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required; 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control;   
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and,  
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 The evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history.  AG ¶¶ 19(a), (b), (c), and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any of the 
mitigating conditions apply.  
 
 Applicant’s failures to file federal and state income tax returns and to pay income 
taxes happened as recently as 2013 and 2014, and he failed to file from as early as 2006 
through 2008. Also, he failed to file for at least seven years. The 2008 recession cannot 
conceivably explain his failures to file from 2006 through 2007, which preceded the 
recession. Applicant’s substantial non-tax debts have been delinquent and remain so 
 
6 
 
since 2011. Applicant’s behavior was neither infrequent, not did it happen so long ago to 
mitigate the security concern. Thus, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 I have expressed doubt above that the 2008 recession was the culprit for all of 
Applicant’s SOR debts. Even if I credit that explanation for some of Applicant’s debts as 
being a circumstance largely beyond his control, the next question is whether he acted 
responsibly under those circumstances. It appears that Applicant’s efforts to enter into 
installment agreements with the IRS and the state began in December 2016, after the 
issuance of the SOR on November 15, 2016. A security clearance adjudication is not a 
proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant’s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.21 The timing of 
Applicant’s efforts to rectify his tax problems calls into question his good faith. 
Furthermore, Applicant has provided no documentation that he has adhered to those tax 
payment agreements. The Appeal Board has routinely held that to mitigate indebtedness 
an applicant must show evidence of a track record of repayments.22  Applicant has not 
shown such evidence here. I cannot find that Applicant acted responsibly as to his SOR 
indebtedness. Thus, AG ¶¶ 20(b) and (g) do not apply.  
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant has received any financial counseling and that 
his debts are being resolved or are under control.  Nor is there any evidence that Applicant 
has initiated and is adhering do a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve his debts.  Thus, AG ¶¶ 20(c) and (d) do not apply. In fact, beyond a 
promise to repay his non-tax debts after he has satisfied his tax liabilities, Applicant has 
submitted no evidence mitigating those non-tax debts. The Appeal Board has long held 
that promises to pay delinquent debts in the future do not mitigate the security concerns 
raised by such debts.23  
 
  The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information.

2015). The Appeal Board has also held that it is reasonable to expect applicants to present documentation 
about the satisfaction or resolution of individual debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Jul. 30, 2008). Applicant has not submitted any such documentation.

Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:                   Against Applicant 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
