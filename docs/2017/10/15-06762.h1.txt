Decision 
______________ 
 
 
DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to file and pay Federal and state income taxes for multiple years 
between 2006 and 2012. She also accumulated debts during that time, which remain 
delinquent. Resulting trustworthiness concerns were not mitigated. National security 
eligibility for a position of trust is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On April 29, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the  
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information,

(AG) effective within the DOD for SORs issued after September 1, 2006; and the AG 
effective within the DOD for SORs issued after June 8, 2017.1  
 
 On June 2, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have her case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 3.) A complete copy of the 
Government’s File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven Items, was mailed to 
Applicant on August 17, 2016, and was received by her on August 25, 2016. The FORM 
notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant 
timely submitted nine documents that she labeled as Items 1 through 9. For purposes of 
clarity, I have re-labeled them as Applicant Items (AI) 1 through 9. Applicant did not file 
objections to the Government’s Items. Department Counsel did not have objections to 
Applicant’s Items. All Items are admitted into evidence. On May 22, 2017, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant did not admit or deny the allegations in the SOR in her initial answer, but 
submitted exhibits in response. (Item 3.) In her reply to the FORM, she admitted the 
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. She denied the other allegations. (AI 
1 through 8.) 
 
 Applicant is 66 years old and married for over 45 years. She has two adult children. 
She has worked for her employer since 2004. In February 2015, she submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for re-investigation. In it, 
she disclosed delinquent debts and back taxes that she attributed to personal and 
financial costs related to the death of family members. (Item 4.) 
 
 During an interview, Applicant explained to an investigator the main factors that 
caused her inability to pay taxes and delinquent bills. In 2006, her husband’s employment 
hours were reduced and remained that way until he retired in 2009 or 2010. In 2007, she 
paid her mother’s burial costs; in 2008, she paid her brother’s burial costs; and in 2009 
or 2010, she paid another brother’s burial costs. (Item 7.) 
 
 Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from March 
2015 and August 2016, the SOR contained 10 allegations related to timely filing and 
paying Federal and state income taxes and 3 delinquent debts. These allegations arose 
between 2006 and 2015. (GE 5, GE 6.)  
 
 In her June 2016 answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted a letter from the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS), dated June 27, 2014. The letter referenced Applicant’s phone 
call on June 14, 2014, and her request for an installment payment agreement to resolve 
                                                 
1I considered the previous AG, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AG, effective June 8, 2017. 
My decision would be the same under either set of guidelines.

unpaid taxes for the following tax years: 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013.2 The IRS 
agreed to automatically deduct monthly payments of $275 from her bank account. 
The letter did not mention the total amount of unpaid taxes owed at this time. Applicant 
stated in her answer that she continued to make payments to the IRS and that her account 
was reviewed every eight months. (Item 3.) 
 
 In reply to the FORM, Applicant submitted another letter from the IRS, dated 
September 8, 2016. It referenced her inquiry of August 29, 2016, and proposal to establish 
an installment agreement for monthly payments of $380. This letter listed the following 
years: 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.3 The letter did not state the total amount 
of unpaid taxes as of that date. (AI 4c.) She submitted a copy of her installment agreement 
activity from July 2014 to July 2015 that indicated she owed a total of $23,902 for those 
years. (AI 4b.) 
  
 (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant did not timely file her 2006 Federal income tax return. In 
January 2009, the IRS filed a substitute 2006 Federal tax return for her. She had received 
an extension for filing to October 2007.  (AI 1.) 
 
  (SOR ¶ 1.b) As of September 2016, Applicant owed the IRS $435 for unpaid 2006 
Federal taxes. In March 2009, she established a repayment plan with the IRS to resolve 
an additional assessed tax of $17,659 for that year. She did not make consistent 
payments on that plan or subsequent plans, as noted in the IRS transcript that reported 
in 2012, 2013, and 2014 she was removed from payment plans for non-compliance and 
assessed additional penalties. (AI 1.)   
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant did not timely file her 2008 Federal income tax return. It was 
filed on June 1, 2009. (AI 2.) 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.d) As of September 2016, Applicant owed the IRS $9,051 for unpaid 
taxes for 2008. According to that IRS transcript, she established payment plans in June 
2009, August 2012, December 2013, and August 2016, but made no payments on the 
plans. (AI 2.) 
  
 (SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant did not timely file a 2011 Federal income tax return. She 
filed it in April 2013. (AI 3.)   
  
 (SOR ¶ 1.f) As of September 2016, Applicant owed the IRS $5,954 for unpaid 
taxes for 2011. In exhibit AI 3, she stated she was on a payment plan for that year, but 
there is no evidence of that in the record.4 
 
                                                 
2 The SOR did not allege unpaid taxes for 2013. Derogatory facts not alleged will not be considered in an 
analysis of disqualifying conditions, but may be considered in evaluating Applicant’s credibility and 
analyzing mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept. 
3The SOR did not allege unpaid taxes for 2014. (See above.) 
4 AI 3 references a 2-page transcript from the IRS; only page 1 is attached.

 (SOR ¶ 1.g) Applicant did not timely file her 2012 Federal income tax return. She 
filed it on January 13, 2014.  (AI 4a.)  
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.h) As of September 2016, Applicant owe the IRS $5,676 for unpaid taxes 
for 2012. She established a payment plan in January 2014, but has not made any 
payments on it or a subsequent plan established in August 2016. (AE 4a.) 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.i) Applicant owed her state $5,680 for unpaid income taxes for 2011. 
Those taxes were resolved in 2015 through a payment plan. (AI 5.) 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.j) Applicant owed a state $2,735 for unpaid income taxes for 2012. Those 
taxes were resolved in 2015 through a payment plan. (AI 5.) 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.k) Applicant made $25 monthly payments in June, July, and August 2016 
on the $403 delinquent retail debt. It is being resolved. (AI 7.) 
 
  (SOR ¶ 1.l) The alleged $22,294 delinquent debt referenced an individual account 
opened in March 2014. Applicant submitted an exhibit referencing a mortgage jointly- held 
with her husband and in a current status. There is no evidence confirming that the alleged 
SOR debt is her mortgage. The account numbers do not match. (GE 5; AI 9.) This is 
unresolved. 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.m) The $315 delinquent debt was paid in May 2016. (AI 8.) 
 
 Applicant did not provide evidence of financial or credit counseling.  According to 
the IRS, Applicant and her husband reported an adjusted gross income of $131,562 for 
2006; $126,461 for 2008; $157,570 for 2011; and $90,103 for 2012. She did not submit 
budget information from which to predict responsible management of her finances or 
continued payment of her taxes and the large outstanding debt. 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for national security eligibility, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant’s eligibility for a position of 
trust. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire 
process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of 
variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider 
 
 
5 
 
 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.  
 
 Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “[t]he applicant 
is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.” 
 
 A person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship 
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends 
normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a 
high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security 
eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant 
may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations 
are set out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
 
6 
 
 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and 
may be disqualifying in this case:  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for 2006, 2008, 2011, and 
2013. She failed to timely pay Federal income taxes for those years. She failed to timely 
pay state income taxes for 2011 and 2012. She also accumulated delinquent debts that 
she had been unwilling to resolve. The evidence raises the above trustworthiness 
concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those 
concerns.  
 
 The guideline includes five conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial problems: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant owes unpaid Federal taxes for six years: 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 
and 2014. Her tax problems have been ongoing since 2006 and continue to cast doubt 
 
 
7 
 
 
on her reliability. Based on the extent of the problem, there is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that such problems will not recur or establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(a). 
 
 Applicant asserted that her unpaid debts and taxes arose after three family 
members died between 2007 and 2009 or 2010, and she paid for their funerals. In 
addition, she stated that her husband’s salary decreased beginning in 2006 and continued 
into his retirement. Applicant’s family funerals may have contributed to her financial 
delinquencies and been beyond her control. However, her assertion that a decrease in 
her husband’s salary contributed to her financial delinquencies lacks merit, considering 
their joint income in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2012. There is insufficient evidence to 
establish full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) because she did not present sufficient evidence 
to conclude that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
 Applicant did not submit evidence that she participated in credit or financial 
counseling. She has not demonstrated that a large debt and her federal taxes are 
resolved, or that there are clear indications they are under control. The evidence does not 
establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant paid and resolved two debts. She 
demonstrated a partial good-faith effort to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 
1.m.  AG ¶ 20(d) applies to those debts. She resolved her 2011 and 2012 state tax debts 
in 2015 through a payment plan. She established mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g) for those 
debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct 
and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national 
security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 66-year-old 
woman, who has worked for her employer since 2004. From 2006 to 2014, she failed to 
 
 
8 
 
 
timely file some Federal income tax returns and pay taxes owed. In 2009, she began 
making payments to the IRS on an installment plan for unpaid 2006 taxes. She did not 
make those or subsequent payments on additional tax year plans consistently as she 
agreed to do. The amount of total federal taxes owed as of September 2016 for tax years 
2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 is unknown, as is a chronology of her payments. 
Her actions to date are not sufficient to outweigh a history of non-compliance with a 
fundamental legal obligation to file and pay taxes. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with these things is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). 
Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of 
those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).5  
   
The record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a position of trust. Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. National eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
