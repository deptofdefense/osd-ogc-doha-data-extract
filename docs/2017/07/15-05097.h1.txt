MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 12, 
2014. On February 29, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
On March 21, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR (SOR Answer), and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
May 25, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on February 2, 2017. On February 8, 
2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the 
hearing was scheduled for March 1, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. I appended to the record the Government’s exhibit list as HE I. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through G, which were 
admitted without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open to March 24, 
2017. Applicant did not provide any additional documents. DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on March 8, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG.1 Accordingly, I have applied 
the June 2017 AG.2 However, because the September 2006 AG were in effect on the 
date of the hearing, I have also considered the September 2006 AG. Having considered 
both versions of the AG, I conclude that my decision would have been the same had I 
applied the September 2006 AG. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 51, has never been legally married.4 She has three children, two 
of whom are now adults and one of whom is now deceased. She received a bachelor’s 
degree in 2010. She has steadily worked full time as an administrative assistant or data 
analyst for defense contractors since at least 2002. For the past five years, she has 
been contracted out to the same government agency. She previously worked as a 
civilian in the U.S. Navy from approximately 1986 through 1993. Applicant has held a 
security clearance since approximately 1984 or 1989.5 
 
The SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts totaling $94,883, as follows: 
 four apartment-rental accounts (three court judgments and one in 
collection status) totaling $6,334 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.o);  
 five medical accounts (one court judgment and four in collection status) 
totaling $32,320 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.k-1.n);  
 a $29,154 federal tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.e);  
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD-4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD-4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD-4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD-4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information. (SEAD-4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards). 
 
3 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from the SOR 
Answer, the SCA (GE 1), and the summaries of Applicant’s January 12, 2015 and April 15, 2015 
interviews with an investigator in connection with this security-clearance investigation (GE 2). 
 
4 In 1993, she was married briefly to a man whom she later discovered had been already married. Their 
marriage certificate was never filed and deemed null and void. Tr. at 28.

was not resolved.

 two State A tax liens totaling $6,379 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g);  
 a $10,576 federal student-loan account in collection status (SOR ¶ 1.h);  
 a $8,341 balance owed on an automobile loan after a voluntary 
repossession (SOR ¶ 1.i.);  
 a $1,047 charged-off furniture account (SOR ¶ 1.j); and  
 a $782 cell-phone bill in collection status (SOR ¶ 1.p).  
 
Applicant’s admissions to three of these debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.i, and 1.o) total $41,006. 
The SOR also alleged a 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 2006 (SOR 
¶ 1.q), use of a company-issued travel card for personal expenses (SOR ¶ 1.r), a 1984 
arrest for felony credit-card fraud (SOR ¶ 1.s), and a 1997 arrest for misdemeanor 
issuance of a bad check (SOR ¶ 1.t). Applicant admitted the allegations set forth in SOR 
¶¶ 1.q and 1.r. 
 
 Applicant moved out of her apartment, without sufficient notice under the terms of 
her lease, in 2013 when her father became ill and she needed to help with his care. Her 
landlord placed the account for collections in the amount of $3,511 (SOR ¶ 1.o). She 
plans to pay this debt once she resolves her IRS and student-loan debt.6 Before moving 
out, she paid her monthly rent late three times because of her pay-schedule. Each time, 
the landlord obtained a judgment against Applicant. The total amount for all three 
judgments was $2,823 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and 1.d). Applicant claimed, without providing 
any corroborating documentation, that she paid all rents due before the court dates of 
the judgments which resulted in them being dismissed.7 
 
Applicant incurred medical bills for services rendered by Hospital A in connection 
with her gall bladder surgery and follow-up appointments, which occurred on a date not 
specified in the record. By 2014, Hospital A had placed five accounts for collection in 
the total amount of $2,081, of which the Government alleged only three totaling $1,361 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.k-1.m). Only two of those accounts (both unalleged debts totaling $720) 
appeared on her credit report in 2015, and none appeared in 2016. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified that another $29,605 medical-collection account also related to this 
surgery (SOR ¶ 1.n). That account appeared on her credit report in 2014 but not in 2015 
or 2016. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that her health insurance should have 
covered 100% of these medical bills, and that she disputed the account with a credit 
bureau (on a date not specified). During her 2015 interview, Applicant explained that 
she changed jobs at the end of the month in which her surgery occurred and that, 
because the hospital did not file her claim until the following month after her insurance 
had expired, her insurance company refused to pay the bills. She did not mention 
whether the follow-up appointments occurred before or after her insurance expired. 
Applicant did not provide any corroborating documents in support of her claims.8

to evaluate mitigation and whole person.

In July 2013, the IRS filed a $29,154 tax lien against Applicant for taxes owed in 
tax years 2007 through 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant attributed the lien to taxes that 
accumulated from 1) a $7,000 inheritance she received in 2004; and 2) her employer 
not deducting enough taxes from her pay in 2010. Since then, she has incurred 
additional fees and penalties. In 2012, she hired Tax Firm A to assist her in negotiating 
with the IRS. Applicant claimed, during her 2015 interview, that she made monthly $200 
payments to the IRS beginning in 2011 until she was laid off in 2014. At the hearing, 
she could not recall having made any direct payments to the IRS, but rather that the IRS 
had taken her tax refunds over the years to apply towards the balance due. She 
admitted that she had not contacted the IRS until after she received a letter from them. 
Tax Firm A expected to receive a letter from the IRS within a few weeks of February 28, 
2017, confirming a proposal that they sent on a date not specified in the record. Without 
providing dates or specific details, Tax Firm A stated that Applicant has been on 
“various” resolution programs during the course of their representation. At the hearing, 
Applicant confirmed that the IRS had not yet made a decision on the proposal.9 
 
 In 2012, State A filed two tax liens against Applicant totaling $6,379 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f 
and 1.g). Applicant claimed that both liens had been released due to a residency status 
error. Applicant proffered a credit report evincing the release of the larger of these two 
liens (SOR ¶ 1.g/$5,863). She did not provide corroborating documentation as to the 
release of the other lien (SOR ¶ 1.f/$516).10 
 
In 2004, Applicant borrowed $6,618 from the federal government to help her 
daughter pay for school. In June 2016, the account had been placed for collections with 
a balance of $13,335 (SOR ¶ 1.h) and Applicant was accepted into a loan rehabilitation 
program. Under the terms of that program, she agreed to timely pay the collection 
company at least nine monthly payments of $181 beginning June 2016. At the hearing, 
without providing any corroborating documentation, Applicant claimed that she has not 
missed a payment.11  
 
In December 2006, Applicant leased a $26,400 car with monthly payments of 
$550. When she could no longer afford the monthly payment due to a salary reduction, 
she voluntarily surrendered her vehicle (on a date not specified in the record). By 2014, 
the lender had charged off the account in the amount of $8,291 for the balanced owed 
after the car sold (SOR ¶1.i). Applicant plans to pay this debt once she resolves her IRS 
and student-loan debt.12  
 
 In May 2013, Applicant financed the purchase of a bedroom set in the amount of 
$1,727. She stopped making payments due to a salary reduction. In February 2014, the 
creditor charged off the account in the amount of $1,047 (SOR ¶ 1.j). Without providing

any corroborating documentation, Applicant claimed that she disputed the account with 
a credit bureau on the basis that the debt was unknown to her. However, during her 
2015 interview, she acknowledged the debt and promised to pay it.13  
 
Applicant disputed SOR ¶ 1.p (cell-phone collection account/$786) on the basis 
that she does not have a cell-phone account with the originating creditor. At the hearing, 
without providing corroborating documentation, Applicant claimed (on a date not 
specified) that she filed a dispute on-line with a credit bureau. The account appears on 
her credit report in 2014, but not in 2015 or 2017. At the hearing, Applicant opined that 
she would make arrangements to pay the account if it were determined to be valid.14 
 
In 2005, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.q) because she was 
unable to pay her debts totaling approximately $10,000 after having “overextended 
herself financially” by “living beyond [her] means.” 15 
 
In 2007, Applicant used her company-issued travel credit card to pay for personal 
expenses totaling approximately $1,300 in violation of company policy (SOR ¶ 1.r). 
Applicant’s supervisor verbally reprimanded her and directed her to pay the account in 
full by a certain date, which she did. She may also have had a ten-day suspension.16  
 
Applicant was found guilty of credit-card fraud and credit-card theft (both 
misdemeanors) in June 1984 (SOR ¶1.s). She was also found guilty of issuing a bad 
check (a misdemeanor) in March 1997 (SOR ¶ 1.t). The 1984 charge involved Applicant 
using a calling card, which she knew to have been stolen by a friend, to make a phone 
call. In the SOR Answer and during the hearing, Applicant denied the 1997 charge and 
claimed that it related to her brother.17 
 
Applicant attributes her post-bankruptcy financial problems to a period of 
underemployment and to financially assisting her adult children (with school, living, and 
other expenses, as needed). She has been always been a single parent without the 
assistance of child support. During a ten-month period between 2013 and 2014, 
Applicant’s annual salary with Contractor A was reduced from $89,000 to $46,000 due 
to contract-funding issues. She left Contractor A to take a position with Contractor B for 
an annual salary of $76,000, which she continues to earn with her current employer who 
took over the contract for Contractor B. Besides the credit counseling that she 
presumably received in connection with her bankruptcy proceedings, she also received 
some credit counseling from her current employer. Applying what she learned from her

recent counseling, she created a spreadsheet to manage her finances each pay 
period.18  
 
At the hearing, Applicant opined that her financial situation was improving given 
that she had been current with her bills without incurring any new debt. However, 
Applicant’s 2016 and 2017 credit reports revealed two new debts in collection status 
that were not alleged in the SOR: a $425 pet hospital bill and a $588 medical bill. In 
September 2014, Applicant took a cruise that she financed via an installment plan in an 
amount less than $1,000. In September 2015, she purchased a new car to replace one 
that had “died.” Her current salary is approximately $3,600 per month. She uses any 
sums left after expenses to pay down her debt.19  
 
Applicant is highly regarded for both her trustworthiness and work performance 
by a former and a current co-worker. Her current employer commended her work 
performance.20 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”21 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”22 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”23 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”24 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.25 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”26 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.27 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.28 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.29 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”30 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”31 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or

unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . 
 
 Applicant’s financial indebtedness establishes three disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations), and AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax as required). Her 2005 bankruptcy filing establishes AG ¶ 19 (e) 
(consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which 
may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of 
late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators).  
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Given the passage of 20 years without any 
recurrence and the underlying circumstances, I find that Applicant’s financial-related 
crimes (SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.r.) are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. However, she has substantial delinquent 
debt that remains unresolved. The concerns about her misuse of a travel card and 
bankruptcy filing remain security significant in light of her ongoing financial 
indebtedness.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant’s surgery, Hospital A’s delay in filing her 
insurance claim, and her salary reduction were circumstances beyond her control. 
However, Applicant did not meet her burden to demonstrate that she acted responsibly 
to address the resulting debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant is credited with having 
received financial counseling and using a spreadsheet to manage her finances each 
pay period. However, because she did not avail herself of the opportunity to submit 
corroborating documentation post-hearing, I cannot conclude that she resolved the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c and 1.d; that she successfully disputed the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.k-1.n, 1.j, and 1.p; or that she established an agreement 
with or made payments to the creditors alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e or 1.h. Because she 
provided documented proof, I find that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g has been resolved. 
While I credit Applicant’s efforts to address her student loan and tax debt, I cannot 
conclude that her financial problems are under control at this time. 
 
AG ¶ 20 (e) is not established. Applicant articulated reasonable bases to dispute 
the legitimacy of her State A tax liens (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g), her Hospital A medical 
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.k-1.n), and her cell-phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.p). However, except as 
to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, she did not provide documented proof to substantiate 
the bases of the disputes or sufficient evidence to demonstrate actions taken to resolve 
them. She did not articulate a reasonable basis to dispute her furniture debt (SOR ¶ 1.j). 
 
AG ¶ 20 (g) is not established. Applicant has worked with a tax firm to negotiate a 
resolution to her federal tax debt (SOR ¶ 1.e) since 2012. Because she did not provide 
any corroborating documents, I cannot conclude that Applicant made monthly payments 
to the IRS between 2011 and 2014. She did not otherwise meet her burden to prove 
that she reached any agreements with the IRS and made direct payments pursuant 
thereto.  
 
For these reasons, I find that SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.s, and 1.t have been mitigated, and 
that SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.r. have not been mitigated. 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security
