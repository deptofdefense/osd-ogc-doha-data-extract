COACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: 
 
On February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on February 21, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 20, 2017. The 
hearing was held as scheduled on June 22, 2017. On June 29, 2017, I proposed that 
this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department 
Counsel did not object.  
 
Applicant presented documentation showing that she paid her federal tax liability 
through an offer and compromise agreement finalized in June 2017. The negotiations 
                                                          
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

with the IRS were ongoing for several years. The tax liability was not initially paid 
because of bad advice given to Applicant by a financial representative. She paid a state 
tax debt for 2015 and set up a payment plan to resolve her remaining state tax liability 
for 2013. She provided proof of settlement of a mortgage deficiency debt and 
Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy from 2003 is remote. Based on the record evidence 
as a whole, I conclude that the security concerns are mitigated under the following 
mitigating conditions: AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).  
 
The concerns over Applicant’s history of financial problems do not create doubt 
about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect 
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also 
gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she 
met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. This case is 
decided for Applicant.
