GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 5, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On June 21, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.2 The SOR

alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 30, 2016. On July 7, 2016, he responded to 
the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on August 12, 2016. The case was 
assigned to me on September 19, 2016.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 21, 
2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 14, 2017. 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, 1 Administrative 
exhibit, and 21 Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE U were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received 
on March 23, 2017. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took 
advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted several documents, which were 
marked and admitted as AE V through AE AB, without objection. The record closed on 
May 22, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.) of the SOR. 
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration 
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been an 
inspection technician with the company since February 2015. He previously held positions 
with other employers: security guard (June 2014 until February 2015); and electronic line 
installer (August 2013 until June 2014). He was the owner of a concrete finishing company 
(January 2005 until December 2012). He was unemployed from December 2012 until July 
2013. He is a June 1976 high school graduate, and he has two years of college credits, 
but no degree. Applicant has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted an interim 
secret security clearance in April 2015. Applicant was married in November 1993. He has 
no children.  
 
  
                                                          
2 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access 
to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were established to supersede all previously issued 
national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on 
September 1, 2006, under which this security clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the 
two versions, there is no substantial difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.

Financial Considerations3 
It is unclear what Applicant’s personal finances were like before they deteriorated. 
Applicant built his concrete finishing company into a very successful enterprise that 
employed approximately 35 employees, had a substantial quantity of equipment, did work 
all over a large multi-state region, and grossed $5,000,000 between 2005 and 2011. His 
wife handled all of the administrative and financial paper work (including payroll and 
billing) concerning the business, and maintained business records in both hardcopy and 
computerized form. Nevertheless, when Applicant’s wife became sick, he found that her 
record-keeping system was in complete disarray, and he found “boxes of stuff stacked 
up.” Applicant attributed his financial problems to five distinct factors: the unsteady 
national economy; competitive underbidding by other contractors because of the 
unsteady economy; poor weather conditions that resulted in reworking multiple jobs at 
additional costs; the chaotic record system; and his wife’s deteriorating medical condition. 
In October 2011, she underwent knee replacement surgery. In 2012, in anticipation of 
closing the business, Applicant’s wife was afflicted with a number of other medical 
conditions that led to depression and anxiety. She had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with 
neurological manifestations, uncontrolled. In 2013, she began having seizures due to scar 
tissue from brain surgery she had previously had several years earlier. She took a large 
number of daily medications.4  
Those factors had a cascading negative impact on Applicant’s financial problems.  
His wife was unable to focus on financial requirements of addressing the business 
finances, filing federal or state income tax returns, or locating the documentation to do 
either. She subsequently and candidly said that she was sick at that time and simply did 
not care. Applicant was dealing with a combination of lost income, his wife’s medical 
conditions, and income tax filings. They obtained filing extensions, and were confident 
that the extensions had been granted, but when the designated assistant income tax 
preparer encountered marital problems, things got sidetracked, and the extended 
deadlines were not met. In April 2013, Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.5  
That same month, a would-be purchaser of the house that Applicant used for his 
business moved into the building. The bank mortgage lender was already in the loan 
process, and the building was pending foreclosure, but it withheld approval of both the 
foreclosure and the new loan while awaiting a decision in the bankruptcy case. The would-
be purchaser began to have second thoughts about buying the property because of the 
bank’s actions, and in September 2013, the would-be purchaser vacated the property 
without making a single mortgage payment during the nearly six months in which he

resided in the building. The bank expected Applicant to pay the missed mortgage 
payments, and when he was unable to do so, it foreclosed on the property.6 
The SOR identified four financial issues. The current status of those issues, 
according to the May 2015 credit report, other evidence submitted by the Government 
and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This refers to Applicant’s failure to timely file federal income tax 
returns for the tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. As noted above, extension requests were 
filed, but the deadlines were not met. With the assistance of a certified public accountant 
(CPA), Applicant filed an individual income tax return (Form 1040) for 2012 (reflecting a 
total income of $283,859) on July 15, 2016;7 a Form 1040 for 2013 (reflecting a total 
income of $79,999) on July 15, 2016;8 and a Form 1040 for 2014 (reflecting a total income 
of $16,336) on July 15, 2016.9 His S corporation federal income tax returns (Form 1120S) 
were filed for both 2012 and 2013 on the same day.10  
On January 4, 2017, Applicant approached the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
and the IRS agreed to a single payment on the Forms 1040 of $64,768.82 by May 4, 
2017.11 Applicant actually made the payment on April 24, 2017.12  On January 4, 2017, 
the IRS was also approached regarding the establishment of an installment agreement 
covering the Forms 1120S. The IRS agreed to a monthly repayment plan calling for 
monthly payments of $131 to eventually resolve the $9,493 remaining balance.13 Two 
initial payments were made in January 2017 ($131) and February 2017 ($225).14 
Applicant made a third and final payment ($9,231) on April 24, 2017.15 Applicant’s federal 
income tax returns have been filed and his federal income tax liabilities have been paid. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This refers to Applicant’s failure to timely file state income tax returns 
for the tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. As noted above, extension requests were filed, 
but the deadlines were not met. With the assistance of a CPA, Applicant filed an individual

individual income tax return for 2013 (reflecting a total due of $2,542) on July 15, 2016;17 
and an individual income tax return for 2014 (reflecting a refund due of $409) on July 15, 
2016.18 His state corporate tax returns were filed for both 2012 (reflecting no payment or 
refund due) and 2013 (reflecting a refund due of $158) on the same day.19 According to 
the state revenue officer, Applicant’s tax liability for 2012 and 2013 has been resolved 
and paid in full.20 
 (SOR ¶ 1.c.): This refers to Applicant’s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Applicant had 
previously had a number of business-related accounts and lines of credit with various 
suppliers, including one for $400,000 with one concrete supplier, and $200,000 with 
another supplier. While many of his accounts were not yet past-due, he realized it would 
be impossible to pay off those accounts. He sought the guidance of an attorney, and 
following his attorney’s advice, he filed for bankruptcy in April 2013. With the exception of 
some small accounts that he reaffirmed, Applicant’s debts were discharged on August 5, 
2013.21 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This refers to a bank-issued mortgage loan for $85,000 on the 
property that Applicant used for his business. Since he was no longer residing in the 
building when his financial issues arose, it was his lowest priority for monthly payments. 
It was included in his bankruptcy. The property was foreclosed in late 2013, and on 
January 22, 2014, the building was sold at public auction at the courthouse for $40,792.22 
Since the amount the bank realized from the auction sale was over the $35,099.84 that 
Applicant had owed, there was no deficiency, and Applicant’s financial obligation to the 
bank was wiped out.23 
In April 2017, Applicant sold his primary residence for $184,250.24 That amount 
was well over the amount owed on the mortgage that was approximately $70,000. 
Applicant used the excess funds to pay off his income tax liabilities. On May 13, 2017, 
Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to reflect his monthly income; 
monthly expenses; or any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary 
spending or savings. The way he reported the various figures is confusing for while he

listed one particular expense ($550 for mortgage or rent) as a liability, he neglected to 
reflect it as a monthly expense. Recalculations indicate that his combined monthly income 
is $3,685; and monthly expenses are $1,175; leaving a monthly remainder of $2,510.25 
Much of the monthly remainder is deposited into their saving account. Now that 
Applicant’s wife’s health has significantly improved, she maintains the family budget. 
Other than the required financial counseling associated with his bankruptcy, Applicant 
denied receiving any other financial counseling. Applicant has no other delinquent 
accounts. Because Applicant has taken positive steps to resolve all of his accounts, his 
finances are under control and improving. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”26 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”27   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”28 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
                                                          
25 AE V (Personal Financial Statement, dated May 13, 2017).

modified.    
 
28 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.29  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”30  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”31 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
                                                          
 
29 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

31 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under ¶ 
19(a), an “inability to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying. In addition, ¶ 19(b) may 
apply if there is an “unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so.” 
Similarly, under ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
concerns. “Consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash 
flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators” 
may raise concerns under ¶ 19(e). In addition, under ¶ 19(f), “failure to file or fraudulently 
filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax as required” may raise concerns. Applicant failed to timely file 
federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2014; his financial 
liabilities were discharged by his 2013 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; and his business property 
mortgage was foreclosed. ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 19(e), and 19(f) apply. ¶ 19(b) does not apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition may 
be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under ¶ 20(b), 
financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in the 
financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted 
responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the individual has received or is 
receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such 
as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under ¶ 20(c). Similarly, ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-
faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”32 In addition, ¶ 20(e) 
                                                          
32 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
 
9 
                                      
 
may apply if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-
due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
In those instances where “the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements,” 
¶ 20(g), may apply. 
 
I have concluded that ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply, and ¶ 20(e) 
does not apply. Applicant built his concrete finishing company into a very successful 
enterprise that employed approximately 35 employees and grossed $5,000,000 between 
2005 and 2011. Things deteriorated from there. The nature, frequency, and recency of 
Applicant’s financial difficulties during 2012 until early 2017 make it difficult to conclude 
that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” His financial situation was caused 
by a combination of circumstances, most of which were largely beyond Applicant’s 
control, that are unlikely to recur: the unsteady national economy; competitive 
underbidding by other contractors because of the unsteady economy; poor weather 
conditions that resulted in reworking multiple projects at additional costs; his wife’s chaotic 
record system; and his wife’s deteriorating medical condition. Added to those factors was 
the issue involving their assistant income tax preparer. Applicant did not ignore his 
financial situation. He sought guidance and assistance from an attorney and a CPA. 
Business and some personal liabilities were discharged by bankruptcy; the foreclosure of 
his business property left him without any deficiency; and his arrangements with the IRS 
and state revenue authorities were made, and Applicant was in full compliance with the 
established filing requirements and repayment arrangements. He filed his federal and 
state income tax returns, and he paid his income taxes. 
  
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.  
 
It is clear that Applicant now has funds remaining at the end of each month for 
discretionary use or savings, and there is evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. When confronted with the combined issues that caused his 
financial problems, Applicant acted responsibly by seeking guidance from his attorney 
and a CPA, and by seeking assistance from his mortgage lender.33 Applicant’s actions

under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment.34 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35   
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
timely file his federal and state income tax returns for 2012 through 2014. He failed to 
timely pay his federal and state incomes taxes for those years as well. His business 
expenses and some personal expenses were too substantial for him to cover, so he 
obtained a bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He defaulted 
on a mortgage, and his business property was foreclosed.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, or 
mishandling protected information. He was the founder and owner of a successful 
business.  His financial situation was caused by a combination of circumstances, most of 
which were largely beyond Applicant’s control, that are unlikely to recur. He did not ignore 
his financial situation. Instead, he sought guidance and assistance from an attorney and 
a CPA. Financial liabilities were discharged by bankruptcy; the foreclosure of his business 
property left him without any deficiency; and he has resolved all federal and state income 
                                                          
4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to 
negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

tax return and unpaid income tax issues. He candidly acknowledged having some 
financial difficulties with several creditors when he completed his e-QIP.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:36 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a positive track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. His efforts were initially hindered by his wife’s medical issues and the 
chaotic situation related to his business and financial records. Overall, the evidence 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
