MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
by his financial circumstances. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 8, 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 On May 21, 2015, 
Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a determination on the 
administrative (written) record. He admitted most of the past-due debts listed on the 
SOR, and stated that he was in the process of cleaning up his credit. He asked for more 
time to execute his plan to resolve his past-due accounts.2 
                                                          
1 The CAF took this action under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The CAF 
adjudicated this case using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, which were applicable for 
all cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Directive between September 1, 2006 and June 7, 2017. 
 
2 Subsequently, Applicant claimed to have paid four past-due accounts and supplied updated credit 
reports. It is unclear whether the paid debts correspond to any of the SOR allegations.  
 
2 
 
 On May 10, 2016, Department Counsel sent Applicant the Government’s written 
case, known as a file of relevant material (FORM). With the FORM, Department 
Counsel forwarded to Applicant six exhibits (Items 1 – 6) that the Government offers for 
admission into the record.  
 
 On July 5, 2016, Applicant submitted a response to the FORM (Response). The 
Response consists of Applicant’s handwritten notations on a copy of the SOR and three 
documents (Exhibits A – C), which he offers for admission into the record. In the 
Response, Applicant again, as he did in his Answer, admits most of the SOR debts and 
promises to address and resolve them.3  
 
 On June 1, 2017, I was assigned Applicant’s case. After confirming Applicant’s 
continued sponsorship for a security clearance, I reopened the record to provide him an 
opportunity to provide updated information, including proof of the steps he had taken to 
address the SOR debts and the status of his current financial situation.4 Applicant did 
not submit any additional matters and the record closed on June 27, 2017. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
 On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence issued Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a “single, common adjudicative 
criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to 
classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.”5 The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (hereinafter “adjudicative guidelines” or “AG”), which are found 
in Appendix A to SEAD-4, are to be used in all security clearance decisions issued on or 
after June 8, 2017.6 Accordingly, I have applied the current version of the adjudicative 
guidelines.7 ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security clearance 
decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards). 
 
                                                          
3 Specifically, Applicant admitted the 16 debts referenced in SOR 1.a – 1.c, 1.e – 1.h, 1.j, 1.m – 1.r, 1.t 
and 1.u. He stated that he would resolve the majority of these debts in early July 2016, and would follow-
up with proof of payment by email. No such proof of payment was submitted. These unresolved debts 
total over $30,000. In his Answer and Response, Applicant denied the two debts listed in 1.d and 1.i, 
totaling nearly $20,000. He did not submit documentation to support the basis of his dispute of these two 
debts. However, he did provide proof showing that he satisfied the $2,000 debt referenced in SOR 1.s 
(Exhibit B). He also submitted documentation showing that he resolved a federal debt through wage 
garnishment (Exhibits A and C; Answer, 11/2/2015 Credit Report at 2). Thus, Applicant addressed and 
resolved the debts referenced in SOR 1.k, 1.l and 1.s, which total about $2,500. 
 
4 Confirmation of Applicant’s continuing sponsorship for a security clearance and the email sent to the 
parties reopening the record were marked as Appellate Exhibits I and II, respectively.

6 SEAD-4, ¶ C, Applicability.  
 
7 Nonetheless, I have considered the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines and my ultimate 
decision in this case would have been the same.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant, 53, is currently working overseas as a contractor supporting the U.S. 
Government. He served in the U.S. military from 1988 to 2011. He was unemployed for 
three months after retiring from the military and before being hired by his current 
employer in July 2011. He was enrolled in an online college from approximately January 
to July 2011, but did not earn a degree. 
 
 Applicant was initially granted a security clearance in approximately 1988, while 
serving in the U.S. military. He submitted a security clearance application in connection 
with his current job as a federal contractor in February 2013. In response to questions 
about his financial record, Applicant asserted that he had no delinquent accounts or 
other negative financial information to report. He certified the accuracy and truthfulness 
of his responses. A few days later, background investigators accessed Applicant’s credit 
report. The credit report reveals that Applicant had numerous accounts that were in 
collection, charged off, or seriously past due.8 
 
 In March 2014, a security clearance investigator asked Applicant if he had any 
delinquent debts or accounts in collection status. He denied having any such debts. The 
investigator then confronted Applicant with the negative information from his March 
2013 and March 2014 credit reports. These credit reports reflect numerous debts that 
were in collection, charged off, or seriously past due. Applicant denied any knowledge 
of these delinquent accounts, but promised to look into them and address them.9  
 
Many of the negative accounts Applicant discussed with the investigator over 
three years ago are listed on the SOR. As of the close of the record, sixteen SOR debts 
totaling about $30,000 remain unresolved. Two additional SOR debts, totaling about 
$20,000, also remain unresolved. Applicant disputes these two debts, but provided no 
documentation to substantiate the basis of his dispute. He has (apparently) taken no 
action to address these debts beyond filing a dispute with the credit agencies following 
the issuance of the SOR.10  
 
 Applicant also told the investigator during his March 2014 clearance interview 
that his net monthly income was approximately $10,600. He claimed monthly expenses 
totaling less than $6,000, which left him with over $4,000 in monthly discretionary 
income.11 Applicant states in his Answer that his financial problems were attributable to 
                                                          
8 Items 2, 3.  
 
9 Items 1, 3, 4, 6. Applicant’s apparent lack of candor about his finances was not alleged in the SOR and 
is only being considered, if at all, in assessing mitigation, credibility, and the whole-person concept.

Applicant to a financial specialist to improve his credit. 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified 
information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to 
authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2; SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions. The guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  
commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a 
fair and impartial decision. AG ¶ 2. 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts 
alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting 
“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a 
favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
Administrative Judges make certain that applicants: (a) receive fair notice of the 
issues, (b) have a reasonable opportunity to address those issues, and (c) are not 
subjected to unfair surprise. Directive, ¶ E3.1.10; ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). In deciding a case, a judge must resolve any doubt raised by the 
evidence in favor of the national security. AG ¶ 2(b). See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4. Moreover, 
the Supreme Court has held that officials making “security clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of 
trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. 
Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may 
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions 
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
                                                          
12 Applicant did not further elaborate or provide evidence as to how his and his wife’s mental health 
condition impacted their finances. Although the negative impact depression and other serious mental 
health conditions can have on a person are well known, Applicant bore the burden of showing how this 
matter impacted his family’s finances and what, if anything, they have done to address the issue. 
Additionally, as Applicant did not report this mental health issue on his clearance application (Item 2 at 
32), it appears this condition surfaced after the negative financial matters at issue began.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .13  
 
Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial 
issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other 
illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances 
giving rise to delinquent debt cast doubt upon a person’s judgment, self-control, and 
other qualities essential to protecting classified information.14 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered all the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, including the following: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts . . .; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, . . . or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control . . . and the individual acted 
responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial 
counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.

 A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection process. Instead, an 
administrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal 
financial obligations to assess how they may handle their security responsibilities.15 
Moreover, the resolution of past financial issues alone without evidence of true reform 
and rehabilitation is of limited probative value in the security clearance context.16  
 
Applicant admits he accumulated 16 debts totaling over $30,000. He discussed 
the majority of these debts during his March 2014 security clearance interview. He has 
repeatedly promised to address and resolve these debts during the course of the 
present security clearance review. He has been gainfully employed since 2011 and, as 
of 2014, reported over $4,000 in monthly discretionary income. A vast majority of the 
SOR debts at issue are for amounts far less than Applicant’s reported monthly 
discretionary income. Notwithstanding his apparent financial ability to repay his debts, 
Applicant has yet to take action to address the vast majority of his delinquent debts. The 
only SOR debts that he had resolved as of the close of the record were three debts 
totaling about half his monthly net income and two of which were satisfied through 
garnishment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) – 19(c) apply. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply.  
 
Individuals applying for a security clearance are not required to be debt free. 
They are also not required to resolve all past-due debts simultaneously or even resolve 
the delinquent debts listed in the SOR first. However, they are expected to present 
evidence to refute, explain, or mitigate security concerns raised by their circumstances, 
to include the accumulation of delinquent debt. Moreover, they bear the burden of 
showing that they manage their finances in a manner expected of those granted access 
to classified information.17 Applicant failed to meet his burden of proof and persuasion. 
His financial situation continues to raise a security concern. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 An administrative judge must make a commonsense judgment about a person’s 
security clearance suitability after considering all available, reliable and relevant 
information. This is referred to as the whole-person concept.18 A judge’s assessment in 
these cases is informed by the guidelines, as well as the non-exclusive factors set forth 
in AG ¶¶ 2(d) and 2(f). I hereby incorporate my above analysis and highlight some 
additional whole-person factors.  
                                                          
15 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). 
 
16 Compare, ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. July 3, 2014) (despite the presence of unresolved debt, 
Board affirmed judge’s grant of a clearance because clear evidence of reform and rehabilitation), with, 
ISCR Case No. 15-03481 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016) (applicant’s resolution of alleged financial issue (filed 
overdue tax returns) was insufficient to mitigate security concerns, because no extenuating 
circumstances to explain financial issue and no evidence of financial reform). 
 
17 ISCR Case 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 15-02585 (App. Bd. Dec. 
20, 2016) (reasonable for judge to expect an applicant to present documentary evidence).  
 
18 See generally AG ¶ 2. See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4; Directive, ¶ 6.3.

 Applicant served in the U.S. military for over 20 years, and for the past six years 
he has supported the U.S. military in a dangerous overseas location. However, he has 
yet to take the necessary responsible steps to put his financial house in order. This is 
despite being aware for some time that his delinquent debts placed his clearance 
eligibility (and his likely continued employment as a federal contractor) in jeopardy. He 
may in the future be able to re-establish his eligibility by demonstrating that he is 
responsibly managing his personal finances in the manner expected of all clearance 
holders. At present, however, the questions and doubts about his eligibility, which were 
raised by his financial situation, remain. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility for continued access to classified information.19 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j:         Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l:        For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.m – 1.r:         Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.s:          For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.t and 1.u:        Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly 
consistent with the interest of national security to continue Applicant’s access to 
classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.

19 I considered the exceptions listed in Appendix C to SEAD-4, and do not find that any are warranted in 
this case. Notably, in light of Applicant’s repeated unkept promises to provide proof that he is repaying his 
past-due debts, continuing his clearance upon condition of proof of repayment and maintenance of 
financial stability would not be appropriate in this case. Furthermore, Applicant’s apparent lack of candor 
during the security clearance investigation also weighs against exercising this discretionary authority. See 
SEAD-4, ¶ E.3 and AG ¶ 2(h); contrast with ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011) 
(under previous version of the guidelines, judges had “no authority to grant an interim, conditional or 
probationary clearance.”)
