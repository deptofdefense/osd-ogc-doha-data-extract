Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges, and the record establishes 
Applicant has seven delinquent debts totaling $23,360. He did not provide sufficient 
evidence of resolution of financial issues or inability to make greater progress. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On June 9, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE 1)) On June 24, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information, which became effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 
AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
 
2 
                                         
 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On August 9, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a hearing. 
On September 13, 2016, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On January 10, 
2017, the case was assigned to me. On February 27, 2017, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals issued a notice setting the hearing for March 14, 2017. The hearing 
was held as scheduled. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, 
and location of his hearing. (Tr. 12-13) Department Counsel offered three exhibits into 
evidence; Applicant offered five exhibits into evidence; and all exhibits were admitted 
without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-18; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-E) On March 
22, 2017, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. On May 15, 2017, Applicant 
provided eight exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 52; AE F-M)  
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for 
all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. He also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact. Additional findings of fact follow. 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old senior quality assurance engineer who has been working 
for a defense contractor since 2002. (Tr. 5, 20) He held a security clearance in the 1990s 
and from 2005 to present. (Tr. 21) There is no evidence of security violations. In 1977, he 
graduated from high school. (Tr. 5) In 1986, he received a bachelor’s degree, and in 1992, 
he received a master’s degree in industrial technology. (Tr. 6) He served in the Navy from 
1976 to 1981, and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 6) When he left active service, 
he was a petty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 7) In 1977, he married, and his two children 
are ages 37 and 38. (Tr. 7)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his spouse’s illness, which affected 
his finances beginning in April 2011. (Tr. 22, 25) He had excellent credit before his 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.  
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits.

spouse’s illness. (Tr. 50) She was not working for three or four months. (Tr. 22) She was 
earning $45,000 to $50,000 each year before April 2011. (Tr. 23) She returned to the 
workforce in July or August 2011. (Tr. 23) About two years ago, she started working as 
an independent contractor out of Applicant’s home. (Tr. 24) Her current annual income is 
about $25,000 to $30,000. (Tr. 24) Applicant has medical insurance; however, his 
deductible is high. (Tr. 25) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage account that went to foreclosure in 2012. Applicant 
allowed family members to live in his home with the mortgage while he lived in another 
home. (Tr. 26-27) When his spouse became ill in April 2011, he fell about $2,500 behind 
on his mortgage. (Tr. 27) The mortgage was about $88,000; the fair market value was 
about $125,000; and the mortgage company accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. (Tr. 
28; AE E at 9; AE G) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h allege three bank credit card debts for $6,568, $2,958, 
and $9,638. The three debts became delinquent in 2011. (Tr. 30) Applicant provided a 
receipt showing payment of $113 in June 2011 to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, and the 
amount owed at that time was $1,609. (AE C; AE E at 12) He made three or four payments 
on one of the debts in 2011; he did not remember the amount of the payments; he did not 
have records of payments; he believed the creditor violated the verbal agreement he had 
with the creditor; and the creditor continued to claim he owed the full amount of the debt. 
(Tr. 30-32) He decided not to make payments or pay these three debts because he did 
not believe the escalating fees and interest charges were fair. (Tr. 32-33) He did not 
attempt to make a written settlement agreement with two of the creditors. (Tr. 33) He 
wanted to wait for the creditors to sue him, and then the judge could decide the amount 
of the debt. (Tr. 33, 47, 51) Then when the four-year state statute of limitations elapsed, 
he recognized that he could not be legally compelled to pay the debts. (Tr. 33; AE F; AE 
L)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $3,163. Applicant co-signed on this debt 
with his daughter. (Tr. 34-35) The debt became delinquent in 2011. (Tr. 35) He 
acknowledged he was responsible for this debt, and he did not take any action to pay it. 
(Tr. 35) He believed his daughter would take care of this debt. (Tr. 36) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off bank debt for $1,893. In 2005, Applicant obtained 
a loan for his daughter to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 36) In 2011, payments to the creditor 
stopped. (Tr. 36) His daughter became divorced. (Tr. 50) The vehicle was repossessed. 
(Tr. 37) In 2015, Applicant received an IRS Form 1099C discharging him from 
responsibility for paying this debt. (Tr. 37; AE H) Applicant paid taxes on the released 
debt. (Tr. 37-38; AE B) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a medical debt for $261. Applicant was billed for ambulance 
transportation in 2015. (Tr. 38) He said he made some payments; he changed banks; and 
the automatic payments lapsed. (Tr. 38) He has not paid this debt; however, he did plan 
to pay it. (Tr. 39) He was focused on family and work for the past year. (Tr. 39) 
 
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $259. The debt became 
delinquent in 2011 and went to collections in 2012. (Tr. 40) Applicant has not done 
anything to resolve this debt. (Tr. 40) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a telecommunication debt placed for collection for $513. This 
debt became delinquent in 2011. (Tr. 40) In May 2011, he paid the creditor $148, and the 
amount due was $295. (AE D) He asked the company to terminate the account; however, 
services continued. (Tr. 41) He said he did not make any payments. (Tr. 41) 
 
Applicant uses a budget. (Tr. 43-44; AE A) He has about $110,000 in his 401(k) 
account. (Tr. 44) In 2015, Applicant and his spouse’s adjusted gross income was 
$167,050. (AE B) In 2015, he purchased two vehicles, and he financed $42,000 for one 
and $22,000 for the other. (Tr. 45) His two vehicle loans are either current or paid. (AE J)                  
About two years ago, he purchased a home for about $210,000, and he financed the 
purchase of a boat in 2014 or 2015. (Tr. 46) He does not currently use any credit cards 
for his personal expenses. (Tr. 51) He noted that several of the SOR debts do not appear 
on his current credit report. (AE E) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
A senior manager has known Applicant for 14 years and supervised him for 4 
years.3 A retired senior manager has known Applicant for 15 years. Another manager has 
known Applicant for 13 years. A customer lauded his attention to detail and 
professionalism. His supervisors described Applicant as honest, reliable, responsible, 
professional, diligent, and trustworthy. He has an excellent reputation in his industry, and 
he received superb employee evaluations. (AE B; AE M)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
                                            
3 The three character-reference letters and email from a customer are the sources for the 
information in his paragraph. (AE B) 
 
5 
                                         
 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
 
6 
                                         
 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” 
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and hearing. The record establishes the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)).  
 
7 
                                         
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
 None of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant disclosed some 
circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. Applicant’s spouse 
was unable to work for several months in 2011, and then when she returned to the 
workforce her pay was reduced. Applicant provided the deed to his residence in lieu of 
foreclosure, and his delinquent mortgage debt is resolved. He received an IRS Form 
1099C, indicating his debt owed to one creditor was cancelled. Applicant is credited with 
mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e.      
 
“[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence 
of debt resolution.” ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires 
removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first 
date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of 
limitations, whichever is longer.6 Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute 
when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, when the debt has been charged 
off, or when the creditor fails to timely authenticate the debt.  
 
All states have statutes of limitations upon collectability of credit card debts, which 
range from three to six years. The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained 
the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations: 
 
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that 
they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving 
security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration 
underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and 
achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide 
potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will 
not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations 
periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of 
limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. 
   
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. 
Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As a general statement, 
under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of limitations 
for collections cannot be mitigated solely because they are not collectable.7  
                                            
6Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit 
Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-
act.pdf.  
 
7The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant’s legal responsibility to pay 
the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of decisions 
the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, which is the 
law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 20(d). See 
ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 
2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 29, 2008) ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007) (stating, “reliance upon legal defenses 
such as the statute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and reliability; 
therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative value in resolving trustworthiness concerns arising out 
 
9 
                                         
 
Recently, the DOHA Appeal Board reinforced its position on statutes of limitations 
not mitigating financial considerations concerns stating: 
 
In this case, the Judge noted that Applicant explained that he did not owe 
any of the alleged debts because they had either been deleted from his 
credit report or soon would be deleted, and he also relied on a state statute 
of limitations to absolve himself of debts. The Appeal Board has long 
recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance purposes even 
if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute of 
limitations or cannot be legally listed on a credit report due to the passage 
of time. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) 
and ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).8 We also have 
held that reliance on a state’s statute of limitations does not constitute a 
good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited mitigative 
value. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 01-
09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003)). 
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). 
 
Applicant relied upon the four-year statute of limitations in his state of residence 
as his rationale for not paying some of his SOR creditors.9 He realized that those debts 
were not collectible after four years elapsed with no payments; however, those debts, 
                                            
of financial problems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).”). This opinion 
does not assert that the statute of limitations provides any mitigation under Guideline F; however, this 
aspect of Applicant’s financial situation is a circumstance that may explain Applicant’s failure to take more 
timely and aggressive actions to resolve his delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has not defined how long 
after the statute of limitations expires an Applicant must wait before receiving a fresh start similar to that 
received when debts are discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.     
     
8Compare ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2014) (holding anti-deficiency act barred 
collection of first mortgage debt and the debt was mitigated). In that case, Applicant corroborated efforts to 
settle a charged-off second mortgage debt. Also, that Applicant had received financial counseling. 
Ultimately, the Board affirmed the Judge’s favorable decision. 
 
9 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for contracts); 
16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont’l Casualty Co. v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 
F.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d 508, 
513-514 (5th Cir. 2004) (discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts).  Debts barred by 
a state statute of limitations are legally uncollectible. However, payments on his debts could have reinstated 
them, ending the statute of limitations defense to collection. See Stine v. Stewart, 80 S.W.3d 586, 591, 45 
Tex. Sup.J. 966 (Tex. 2002). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that creditors can legally 
enforce because of the application of a state statute of limitations reduces the potential vulnerability to 
improper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is “financially overextended,” is also reduced. 
However, it does not negate the debtor’s past conduct in which he or she failed to take more aggressive 
actions to resolve his delinquent debts.

even the ones removed from his credit report, remain unresolved for security clearance 
purposes.10  
 
Applicant did not provide enough details about what he did to address his SOR 
debts over the last five years. Aside from proof of a $113 payment to one SOR creditor in 
May 2011, and a $148 payment to another SOR creditor in May 2011, he did not provide 
sufficient documentation relating to the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.i: 
(1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or 
a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) 
correspondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact;11 (3) credible 
debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and why he 
held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as 
settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve these debts; 
or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to establish mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to substantiate the 
existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. 
   
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress resolving his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial 
problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all 
the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns 
are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
                                            
10The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).   
 
11“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old senior quality assurance engineer who has been working 
for a defense contractor since 2002. He held a security clearance in the 1990s and from 
2005 to present, and there is no evidence of a security violation. In 1986, he received a 
bachelor’s degree, and in 1992, he received a master’s degree in industrial technology. 
He honorably served in the Navy from 1976 to 1981. Applicant’s character evidence 
established his attention to detail, professionalism, honesty, reliability, responsibility, 
diligence, and trustworthiness. He has superb employee evaluations.  
 
Applicant had excellent credit before his spouse’s illness. She was not working for 
three or four months. She is earning considerably less than she was before her illness in 
2011. This illness and reduction in income adversely affected Applicant’s finances. 
Applicant is credited with the resolution of his mortgage account through deed in lieu of 
foreclosure and one SOR creditor cancelled one debt. He generated a budget, his 401(k) 
account has $110,000 in it, and all of his recent debts, such as his mortgage, boat 
payment, and car payments, are current.  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for seven delinquent SOR debts totaling $23,360. 
He provided insufficient corroborating or substantiating documentary evidence of 
payments and established payment plans for his SOR debts. He did not provide a detailed 
plan about how he intended to resolve all of his delinquent SOR debts. His actions show 
lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG 
¶ 18. More documented information about inability to pay debts, financial history, or 
documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able 
to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent 
 
12 
                                         
 
with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this 
time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.i:  Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
