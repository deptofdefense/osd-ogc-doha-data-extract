Decision 
______________ 
 
MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86 (SF86) 
on December 3, 2014. On October 12, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging 
security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 2, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
November 29, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on January 25, 2017. On 
February 28, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 30, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record a letter the Government sent to Applicant as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which I admitted into 
evidence, without objection. At the hearing, three witnesses testified on behalf of 
Applicant. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open to April 13, 2017. Applicant 
timely provided additional documents that I admitted into evidence as AE B and C, 
without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG.1 Accordingly, I have applied 
the June 2017 AG.2 However, because the September 2006 AG were in effect on the 
date of the hearing, I have also considered the September 2006 AG. Having considered 
both versions of the AG, I conclude that my decision would have been the same had I 
applied the September 2006 AG. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 49, divorced his second wife of 19 years in August 2014. They 
had previously separated in 2012. He has two adult children, ages 21 and 19. Since 
receiving a high school diploma in 1986, he has taken some college courses through a 
program at work. The same defense contractor has employed Applicant since 1988. 
Applicant has maintained a security clearance for over 28 years.4 
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges five delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.d, and 1.f), totaling approximately $31,302, and a 2015 foreclosure (SOR ¶ 1.e).  
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2014 (SOR ¶ 2.a), 
and that he deliberately failed to disclose it on his SF86 (SOR ¶ 2.b). It also alleges that 
he deliberately failed to disclose on his SF86: 1) the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.e (SOR ¶ 2.c); and 2) that he was hospitalized for an emotional or mental health 
condition in 2014, and subsequently treated on an outpatient basis for that condition 
(SOR ¶ 2.d). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD-4 ¶ B, Purpose).  The 
SEAD-4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD-4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD-4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information.  (SEAD-4 ¶ C, Applicability).

through 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 2.a. At the hearing, he admitted the facts alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d.5 
 
Guideline F  
 
A medical creditor placed Applicant’s account in collection status in the amount 
of $55 in July 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).6 In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that he was in 
the process of “organizing his finances [in order] to pay this debt.” At the hearing, 
Applicant claimed no knowledge of the debt and revealed that he had made no effort to 
investigate or research it.7 This debt remains unresolved. 
 
In June 2004, Applicant opened a charge account with a credit limit of $6,000 to 
purchase a computer, television, and other electronics through a computer company. In 
November 2013, that company charged off the account in the amount of $8,406. In April 
2015, that company placed it in collection status in the amount of $7,907 (SOR ¶ 1.b). 
In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that this debt was “being paid.” At the hearing, 
Applicant stated that, at an unspecified time, he tried to withdraw funds from his 401(k) 
plan to pay this debt but his request was denied since the debt was not an eligible 
expense.8 This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant opened a credit-card account in October 2011 with a credit limit of 
$5,000. In December 2014, Applicant was 120 days or more past due in the 
approximate amount of $823, with a total balance of $5,205. By September 2015, the 
creditor had charged off the account in the amount of $5,295. By September 2016, the 
balance increased to $5,822 (SOR ¶ 1.c). In his SOR answer, he stated that he would 
pay this debt “as soon as [the debt alleged in ¶ SOR 1.b was] paid.” Sometime after he 
received the SOR, the creditor garnished Applicant’s wages to collect the debt. At the 
hearing, without providing any corroborating documentation, Applicant claimed that the 
garnishment was fully satisfied in January 2017. He acknowledged that he made no 
effort to resolve the debt prior to the garnishment, which was issued against him 
involuntarily.9 This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant financed an automobile for his wife in October 2011 with a loan in the 
amount of $22,177. By September 2015, the lender had charged off the account in the 
amount of $13,216 (SOR ¶ 1.d). By September 2016, the balance had decreased to 
$5,559. At the hearing, Applicant was unable to recall any specifics about this debt and 
acknowledged that he had not made any effort to investigate or research it. He admitted 
that the decreased balance was not due to any action on his part, given that he never

reached out to the creditor to resolve or otherwise address it.10 This debt remains 
unresolved. 
 
Applicant purchased a home in December 2003, financing 100% of the $173,000 
purchase price through a home-mortgage loan. He refinanced the loan in 2007. 
Applicant acknowledged that he and his wife fell behind with the loan payments when 
they separated in 2012. However, Applicant claimed that, when they met with a divorce 
mediator in mid to late 2013, they were only a month or two behind. However, by 
December 2014, the loan was 120 days or more past due in the amount of $26,605, 
with a remaining balance of $199,404. By September 2015, it was $44,820 past due. 
Between 2007 and September 2015, his monthly payment was between approximately 
$1,341 and $1,972. By August 2014, the home was in foreclosure status.11 On a date 
not specified in the record, the lender foreclosed on the mortgage loan. In September 
2016, the lender reported a $0 balance. Applicant was unaware of whether he owed a 
deficiency balance on the loan and has not contacted the lender to find out. He was 
“waiting to see what happens.”12 The SOR alleged the fact of the foreclosure, but not 
any indebtedness on the mortgage-loan account (SOR ¶ 1.e). 
 
Applicant financed an automobile for his wife in 2008 with a $24,132 loan. In July 
2010, the lender charged off the account in the amount of $4,202 (SOR ¶ 1.f).13 At a 
point not specified in the record, the lender repossessed the automobile. In his SOR 
answer, Applicant stated that his ex-wife was responsible for paying this debt. At the 
hearing, Applicant stated that he believed he did not owe the debt because he has not 
heard anything from his lender. He acknowledged that he had not made any effort to 
resolve this debt.14 This debt remains unresolved. 
 
Applicant attributes his financial indebtedness to his wife’s mismanagement of 
their finances, which she handled during their marriage. Applicant claimed that he was 
unaware of her mismanagement until approximately 2007 when a creditor repossessed 
his wife’s car for nonpayment. Thereafter, he did not take a more active role in 
managing their finances. While “he knew [they] were struggling” and that “things were 
[not] always the way they should [have] been with the amount of money [he] was 
making,” he never thought that his finances were “bad, bad.” He acknowledges that he 
overspent at times in an attempt to “keep [his wife and two children] happy [by, 
financially,] giving them what they want[ed].”15 Applicant reported having “financial 
problems” to a medical provider in June 2014.16

While separated and during their divorce proceedings, marital debts were 
allocated between Applicant and his wife. Applicant claimed, without providing sufficient 
corroborating documentation, that the parties agreed to divide equally their marital 
debts, including the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d, and that his wife was solely 
responsible for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.17 However, because these debts were in 
his name, he acknowledged that he was ultimately responsible for them.18 
 
As of March 2017, Applicant earned an annual salary of approximately $109,600 
plus overtime pay totaling approximately $200 and a $750 annual bonus. During the 
marriage, his wife worked part time and earned approximately $300 per week. Between 
2012 and 2014, Applicant voluntarily paid his wife $1,200 per month. Since August 
2014, he has paid alimony to his ex-wife of $1,800 per month. He does not have any 
obligation to pay child support as his youngest child has resided with him since January 
2014. Applicant described his current finances as “living paycheck to paycheck,” and 
stated that he has nothing extra to pay his delinquent debt. While he has “zero” dollars 
in his checking account, his 401(k) has a balance of $107,000. He has not incurred any 
additional delinquent debt beyond that alleged in the SOR. 19 
 
Applicant has not sought out any financial counseling or assistance. At the 
hearing, he stated that while he has been advised that bankruptcy is an option to 
resolve his debt, he wants to pay his bills and considers bankruptcy to be “copping out” 
or “trying to weasel out of” paying what he owes.20 Without referencing specific debts, 
Applicant stated that he intends to pay his delinquent debts once he is financially able. 
He hopes to end his alimony soon. If not, then he will “have to figure out [his] options.” 21  
 
Guideline E  
 
On June 8, 2014, Applicant intentionally overdosed on prescription medication. 
He took 20 tablets of 1 mg Xanax pills and drank either one beer or two drinks, which a 
doctor described as a “sincere suicide attempt.” That night, Applicant was involuntarily 
held at a hospital’s emergency room for psychiatric evaluation, where he was diagnosed 
with major depression, intentional overdose of Xanax, and suicidal ideation. The next 
day, he was transferred to another hospital for inpatient-psychiatric stabilization. There, 
he was diagnosed with depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, and then 
discharged on June 11, 2014. Applicant submitted to an outpatient-psychiatric

evaluation with a psychiatrist on June 12, 2014 and had one follow up visit with that 
provider on June 26, 2014. She diagnosed him with major depressive affective disorder, 
single episode mild degree. Applicant received outpatient therapy (involving family, 
marital, and psychological services) with a licensed mental health professional seven 
times in 2014 (October 23rd, October 30th, November 7th, November 14th, November 
21st, December 5th, and December 19th) and on January 16, 2015.22  
 
On September 27, 2014, Applicant’s security officer (SO) advised him by email 
that his periodic reinvestigation was due the following month. The SO attached to that 
email a worksheet in word format titled “SF86 FINAL w.add’l pages.doc,” and advised 
Applicant that he could either complete the worksheet and return it to the SO for typing 
or “[complete it] on line.” The record does not contain a copy the referenced 
attachment.23 
 
On October 31, 2014, Applicant signed a security form acknowledging receipt of 
a blank SF86 to be completed jointly by the Applicant and his company’s security team 
(Security). Therein, Applicant also acknowledged 1) that he would be required to 
complete the SF86 and that Security would type the information into the required 
government system, 2) that once Security typed the information, Security would contact 
Applicant to review the paperwork for final submittal, 3) that the SF86 instructions are 
very explicit and must be followed precisely, and 4) that he was to read the SF86 
questions carefully.24 
 
On November 5, 2014, Applicant sent a document in PDF format titled “Periodic 
reinvestigation-Secret clearance.pdf” to the SO by email. The record does not contain a 
copy of the referenced attachment.25 
 
On November 8, 2014, the SO advised Applicant by email that he had typed up 
his “security clearance periodic reinvestigation” and provided him a list of questions that 
Applicant needed to answer, none of which were the subject of the falsification 
allegations in the SOR. The SO also attached to that email a worksheet in PDF format 
titled “TANNER, ROBERT SECTION 26.pdf.” The referenced attachment was a blank 
two-page form asking questions related to Section 26 (Financial Record) of the SF86.26 
 
During an argument that Applicant had with his wife on November 9, 2014, he 
pushed her. His wife’s sister, to whom his wife was talking on the phone during the 
incident, called the police. When the police arrived, they arrested Applicant, transported 
                                                          
22 GE 3. The record contains unresolved discrepant information about how much alcohol Applicant 
consumed: one beer (GE 3 at 20) or two drinks (GE 2 at 31). The discrepancy is not material.

him to the police station, and fingerprinted him. Before he was eventually “let go,” the 
police charged him with unlawful restraint and disorderly conduct (SOR ¶ 2.a), and 
issued a temporary-restraining order against him, which included a requirement that he 
have no contact with his wife and that he stay away from the marital home.27 On a date 
and for a term not specified in the record, a longer-term restraining order was issued 
against Applicant, which prohibited him from having any physical contact with his wife or 
harassing her.28 After he completed required classes through his local superior court, 
the charges were dropped. He has not either spoken to or been around his ex-wife 
since November 2014.29 
 
On December 1, 2014, Applicant replied by email to his SO to answer the 
questions posed in the SO’s November 8, 2014 email and to return the completed 
worksheet in PDF format titled “section 26.pdf.” The referenced attachment was the 
same two-page form provided by the SO, on which Applicant had handwritten details in 
response to questions about the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.30  
 
On December 3, 2014, Applicant signed his SF86 certifying that the statements 
he made therein were “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and 
belief and [were] made in good faith.” On March 17, 2015, he was interviewed in 
connection with his security-clearance investigation to discuss, among other things, the 
contents of his SF86. 
 
In section 17 (Marital Status) of the SF86, Applicant reported that he was 
“married” and did not report his August 2014 divorce or his earlier two-year separation. 
During his March 2015 interview, he acknowledged that he was separated from his wife, 
but claimed that they would “be filing for divorce soon.” He referenced his “soon to be 
ex-wife” in response to a question about his finances in section 26 of the SF86. During 
the hearing, he claimed that he “definitely was [not] divorced before [he] filled out [the 
SF86].31  
 
In section 22 (Police Record) of the SF86, Applicant answered “No” to the 
question of whether he had been, in the last seven years, “arrested by any police 
officer, sheriff, marshal or any other type of law enforcement official?” (SOR ¶ 2.b). He 
also answered “No” to whether there was then “currently a domestic violence protective 
                                                          
27 Because this fact was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only for the purpose of evaluating 
mitigation and whole person. 
 
28 As of November 14, 2014, the restraining order was in effect. (GE 3 at 49). It was also in effect as of 
March 17, 2015. (GE 2 at 8).

order or restraining order issued against [him]?”32 During his March 2015 interview, 
Applicant voluntarily disclosed the 2014 arrest and related temporary-restraining order. 
When asked about why he failed to disclose them on the SF86, he claimed that the 
events occurred “after he completed his [SF86.]” When asked at the hearing about why 
he failed to report his November 2014 arrest, he initially claimed that he “believed [it] 
happened after [he] filled out the [SF86].” In fact, more than once, he stated that he 
could have “sworn” it happened after. When further questioned, he claimed alternatively 
that he “did [not] think it was an issue” since “no charges were filed.”33 
 
In section 21 (Psychological and Emotional Health) of the SF86, Applicant 
answered “No” to the question of whether he had, in the last seven years, “consulted 
with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition [or 
had been] hospitalized for such a condition.” (SOR ¶ 2.d). During his March 2015 
interview, Applicant voluntarily disclosed that he “misused prescription drugs” in 
November 2014 while in possession of a security clearance. He stated that he had been 
“taken to the hospital” after “accidentally overdos[ing]” on a prescription drug that he 
had been previously prescribed after he misread the label. He claimed that he failed to 
disclose his hospitalization on the SF86 because the events occurred “after he 
completed his [SF86.]” When asked at the hearing about why he failed to report his 
June 2014 hospitalization, he claimed that he “believed [it] happened after [he] filled out 
the [SF86].”34 
 
In section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of the SF86, Applicant 
answered “No” to the question of whether he had, “intentionally engaged in the misuse 
of prescription drugs” in the last seven years.35 Neither during his March 2015 interview 
or the hearing did Applicant discuss why he failed to answer “Yes” to this question. 
 
In section 26 (Financial Record) of the SF86, Applicant answered “Yes” to 
whether he had any “possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or 
foreclosed” in the past seven years. He reported that he had defaulted on an automobile 
loan in the approximate amount of $24,132 with the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, who 
had repossessed a vehicle because his wife had not made the payments. He further 
explained that it was his “soon to be ex-wife’s responsibility.” He did not report any other 
delinquent debts on his SF86 (SOR ¶ 2.c), nor did he provide a “Yes” response to 
whether he had, in the past seven years: 1) “defaulted on any type of loan,” 2) “bills or 
debts turned over to a collection agency,” 3) “any account or credit card suspended, 
charged off, or cancelled for failing ot pay as agreed,” or 4) been “over 120 days 
delinquent on any debt not previously entered;” or whether he was then “currently, over

120 days delinquent on any debt.” During his March 2015 interview, he claimed that he 
did not report the foreclosure because it occurred “after he completed [the SF86].” As to 
the debts alleged in ¶¶ SOR 1.a and 1.b, he claimed that he had no knowledge of them. 
However, he did acknowledge, generally, that he had outstanding “medical bills to pay,” 
and had been organizing them in order to have them all satisfied by the end of 2015. He 
did not discuss the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. As to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, he 
believed that it had been “on track” because he had been in the process of paying off 
certain bills. As to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, Applicant acknowledged that it had 
gone unpaid because his wife “was spending money that they did not have.” 
 
He also answered “No” to whether he, in the past seven years, 1) had “failed to 
file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance” within the 
past seven years;” or 2) had his “wages, benefits, or assets garnished or attached for 
any reason.” He did not otherwise report that that he had failed to timely file his 2013 tax 
returns, and that his wages had been garnished in 2012 to pay his 2011 taxes.36 During 
his March 2015 interview, he claimed that he failed to disclose these facts on his SF86 
because he was “unable to provide all the specific details” because he was prohibited 
by a restraining order from contacting his wife, who “[had] all the paperwork.” He 
attributed this restriction to his failure to timely file his 2013 tax returns. At his hearing, 
Applicant claimed to be current with his tax-return filings and tax payments to both the 
state and federal government.37 
 
When asked at the hearing why he failed to report the delinquent debts or the 
foreclosure listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e., he initially claimed that he “believed” that 
he did not know about them at the time he filled out his SF86. When further questioned, 
he admitted that he knew that his mortgage-loan payments were delinquent at the time 
that he filled out his SF86, but did not list them because he thought that he was going to 
“catch up” on them, and did not think that they were “that far” behind. He claimed that 
they were only one or two months behind when he filled out his SF86. He did not review 
his credit report or speak with his ex-wife about the status of their debts before filling out 
the SF86.38 
 
At the hearing, Applicant verified that he signed the SF86 on December 3, 
2014,39 that he completed it at work and without any time constraints, and that he was 
not rushed in any way nor distracted or otherwise prevented from answering the 
questions fully and completely.40 However, he claimed that he signed more than one 
SF86 and that the original one that he filled out would have occurred before the 
                                                          
36 Because this fact was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only for the purpose of evaluating 
mitigation and whole person.

incidents at issue in SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d.41 He further claimed that if an event 
happened before he signed his SF86, then he would have disclosed it and “would [not 
have] lied about it.”42 He also stated that he filled out an electronic version of the SF86 
questionnaire first and then completed some supplemental paperwork about his 
reported financial issue (SOR ¶ 1.f).43

Applicant’s current manager, who has known him for three years and interacts 
with him daily, commended Applicant’s work performance. He also found him to be 
trustworthy.44 Applicant’s friend of 24 years, who is also a co-worker, currently interacts 
with him approximately once a week. Between approximately 2013 and 2016, he 
interacted with Applicant daily because he worked for Applicant. He opined that 
Applicant was a trustworthy individual who exercises good judgment.45 Another friend 
and co-worker, who currently interacts with Applicant two or three times a week, also 
commended Applicant’s work performance and trustworthiness.46 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”47 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”48 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”49 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An

administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.51 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”52 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.53 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.54 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.55 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”56 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”57

Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”) and 
AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). I do not find facts sufficient 
in the record to support the application of AG ¶ 19(e) (“consistent spending beyond 
one's means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of 
non-payment, or other negative financial indicators”), as the Government argued should 
apply at the hearing.58 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
                                                          
58 Tr. at 145 
 
13 
 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that 
remain unresolved. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant’s separation and divorce were 
circumstances beyond his control. However, Applicant has not acted responsibly to 
resolve his delinquent debts since then.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant has not received financial 
counseling. Because he has not initiated any action to resolve his delinquent debts, I 
cannot conclude that Applicant’s financial problems are under control at this time. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result 
in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security 
clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security 
eligibility: 
 
(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo 
or cooperate with security processing, including but not 
limited to meeting with a security investigator for subject 
interview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation 
with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph 
examination, if authorized and required; and 
 
(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to 
lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other 
official representatives in connection with a personnel 
security or trustworthiness determination. 
 
 
14 
 
Applicant’s arrest establishes the following disqualifying condition: 
 
AG ¶ 16(d)(2): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered 
under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an 
adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available 
information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that 
the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive 
information. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any 
disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior . . . . 
 
His deliberate failures to disclose security-significant derogatory information on 
his SF 86; including facts about his arrest, his hospitalization and treatment for an 
emotional or mental health condition in connection with his suicide attempt, and the full 
extent of his financial problems potentially establishes the following disqualifying 
condition: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national 
security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government 
has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. 
An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an 
applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission.59 An applicant’s level of education 
and business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose 
relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate.60  
 
Applicant’s arrest and suicide attempt occurred before the date that he certified 
his SF86; the arrest less than a month prior, and the suicide attempt less than seven 
months prior. After his suicide attempt, he was diagnosed with psychological conditions 
for which he was hospitalized and treated on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. He 
was hospitalized and treated prior to the date that he certified his SF86. Within two 
months of certifying his SF86, he had attended five outpatient-therapy sessions. 
Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to corroborate his claim that he completed 
an SF86 prior to his arrest and suicide attempt. However, even if he had, it would not 
excuse his failure update his SF86 prior to certifying its accuracy on December 3, 2014, 
especially given his experience with the security-clearance investigations process over 
28 years.  
 
                                                          
59 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). 
 
60 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). 
 
 
15 
 
I did not find credible his explanations and excuses for failing to report any 
potentially derogatory information on his SF86. Applicant’s disclosure of one delinquent 
debt, which he claimed was not his responsibility, is neither derogatory nor sufficient to 
put the Government on notice of the significant financial problems with which he knew 
he was plagued since at least 2012. Regardless of whether he knew the particulars or 
had access to documents in his wife’s possession, at the very minimum, he should have 
reviewed a credit report prior to certifying his SF86.  
 
Applicant also failed to report his divorce or separation, his intentional misuse of 
a prescription drug, his failure to timely file tax returns, and his wage garnishment, all of 
which were reportable events that occurred prior to the date that he certified his SF86. I 
find that these additional omissions, collectively, further evince Applicant’s intent to 
exclude derogatory information from his SF86. Given these facts, I find substantial 
evidence of an intent on the part of the Applicant to omit, conceal, and falsify security-
significant facts from and on his SF86. Therefore, AG ¶ 16(a) is established.  
 
While I do not consider any physical assault of a spouse to be a minor offense, I 
find that Applicant’s arrest resulted from isolated circumstances that are unlikely to 
recur. I considered that Applicant volunteered information about his arrest, 
hospitalization, prescription drug misuse, wage garnishment, and failure to file tax 
returns during his March 2015 interview. However, because he minimized the 
circumstances of his hospitalization during that interview and failed to acknowledge at 
his hearing any wrongdoing with respect to his deliberate failures to disclose any 
potentially derogatory information on his SF 86, I have serious doubts about his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the potentially applicable 
mitigating conditions under this guideline applies except for AG ¶ 17(c) as to the facts 
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a.61 Accordingly, I find SOR ¶ 2.a in favor of Applicant and ¶¶ 2.b 
through 2.d against him. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                                          
61 AG ¶ 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or 
falsification before being confronted with the facts); and AG ¶ 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much 
time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment). 
 
16 
 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in 
the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his financial indebtedness and his deliberate omission of security-
significant derogatory information from his SF86. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried 
his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.f: Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:  For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 2.b – 2.d: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
