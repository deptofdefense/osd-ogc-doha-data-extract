Decision 
______________ 
 
MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 12, 2015 
(SCA1), and another SCA on March 13, 2016 (SCA2). On October 24, 2016, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines G and E. The 
DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 22, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
December 21, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on January 25, 2017. On 
February 27, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 29, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled.  
 
2 
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record a letter the Government sent to Applicant as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted into 
evidence, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open to April 12, 
2017. Applicant timely provided additional documents that I admitted into evidence as 
AE B and C, without objection. I appended the associated post-hearing email 
exchanges to the record as HE III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG.1 Accordingly, I have applied 
the June 2017 AG.2 However, because the September 2006 AG were in effect on the 
date of the hearing, I have also considered the September 2006 AG. Having considered 
both versions of the AG, I conclude that my decision would have been the same had I 
applied the September 2006 AG. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 59, divorced his wife of 31 years in 2011. He has two adult 
children and one 16-year-old child. He received his high school diploma in 1977, and 
has taken some college and technical-school courses. He honorably served in the U.S. 
Navy from 1977 through 1981.4  
 
Applicant has worked for his current employer since January 2017, after being 
unemployed for approximately one and a half years. He had previously been employed 
by a defense contractor (Employer A) for about 31 years, for whom he maintained 
security clearances at various times. Employer A fired Applicant in June 2011, rehired 
him in June 2013, and then separated him in January 2015 pending adjudication of his 
security clearance. Applicant is subject to rehire by Employer A.5 
 
The SOR contains 10 allegations under Guideline G involving Applicant’s 
excessive alcohol consumption between 1977 and May 2015, including five DUI arrests 
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD-4 ¶ B, Purpose).  The 
SEAD-4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD-4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD-4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information.  (SEAD-4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards). 
 
3 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from 
Applicant’s SOR Answer, his two SCAs (GE 1 and GE 2), and the summary of his 2015 subject interview 
with an investigator in connection with this security-clearance investigation (GE 6).

(in 1992, 1993, 1998, 2011, and 2014),6 one non-DUI but alcohol-related arrest (in 
1987), 1994 treatment for a condition diagnosed as alcohol dependence, and a 2011 
termination from employment (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j). Under Guideline E, the SOR 
cross-alleges each Guideline G allegation (SOR ¶ 2.a) and also alleges that Applicant 
deliberately failed to disclose on SCA1 his 1994 treatment (SOR ¶ 2.b) and his 1987, 
1992, 1993 and 1998 arrests (SOR ¶ 2.c). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the 
facts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, 1.e. through 1.j, and ¶ 2.a (except as to ¶ 1.d). 
Applicant denied that he was arrested in 1993 as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d and that he 
deliberately falsified SCA1 as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c. 
 
Guideline G 
 
 In 1987, Applicant destroyed a public phone receiver after consuming 
approximately four to five beers in a local bar. A court found him guilty of property 
destruction, ordered him to give $150 to a charitable organization, and placed him on 
probation for one year.7 (SOR ¶1.b). 
 In August 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (after registering a 
BAC of .17%). A court found him guilty of DUI, placed him in a pretrial education alcohol 
system for a one-year period, and required him to attend at least eight weeks of alcohol-
education counseling.8 (SOR ¶ 1.c). 
 
 In July 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (after registering a 
BAC of .17%). A court found him guilty of DUI, sentenced him to six months in jail 
(suspended), ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service, fined him $563, 
and placed him on probation for one year.9 (SOR ¶ 1.d).  
 
 Seeking to address a self-described “alcohol problem” stemming from marital 
and financial problems to which he attributed his excessive drinking, Applicant 
voluntarily entered an inpatient alcohol-treatment program in January 1994. He 
withdrew from the program after a few days because he was unable to afford it without 
insurance coverage. Instead, he enrolled in an outpatient alcohol-treatment program, 
which he attended twice in February 1994 before discontinuing enrollment due to his 
suspended driver’s license and heavy job commitments.10 (SOR ¶ 1.e).  
 
                                                          
6 I considered that Applicant was charged in 1992 and 1994 with driving under the influence (DUI) and in 
1998, 2011, and 2014 with operating under the influence (OUI). However, for ease of reference, I will 
refer to each of them as DUIs in my decision.

 Applicant admitted that he was treated in 1994 “for a condition diagnosed as 
Alcohol Dependence” (SOR ¶ 1.e) in his SOR answer. However, at the hearing, 
Applicant denied that he was ever diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol 
abuser during his 1994 treatment or otherwise.11 Another DOHA administrative judge 
who had access to the actual medical record for the 1994 treatment did not find it 
sufficient to conclude that Applicant was so diagnosed, because it was unsigned and 
missing pertinent details. In this case, the Government did not provide either a medical 
record or other evidence that Applicant was so diagnosed.12 
 
 In January 1995, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant alleging under Guideline G 
his 1987, 1992, and 1993 arrests and his 1994 treatment. The SOR also alleged under 
Guideline E that Applicant falsified a 1994 SCA by omitting his 1992 arrest and his 1994 
treatment. Applicant chose to contest that SOR and requested a hearing. At his hearing, 
Applicant acknowledged that he was a recovering alcoholic, who was strongly 
committed to future abstinence. A DOHA administrative judge found both Guidelines G 
and E in Applicant’s favor after concluding that his omissions were not intentional and 
that he demonstrated a commitment to “sustained sobriety,” which at the time was 14 
months.13  
 
In August 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (after he had been 
out drinking beer with his wife, and swerved his vehicle). A court found him guilty of 
DUI, placed him in an advanced rehabilitation program, ordered him to complete 100 
hours of community service, and placed him on probation for one year.14 (SOR ¶ 1.f). 
 
In January 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (after he had 
been drinking four beers at a bowling alley, and drove off the side of the road). A court 
found him guilty of DUI, sentenced him to six months in jail (all but 15 days suspended), 
ordered him to complete an alcohol-treatment program and 100 hours of community 
service, fined him $750, and placed him on probation for one year.15 (SOR ¶ 1.g). 
 
In June 2011, Employer A fired Applicant because of excessive absences due to 
his 2011 DUI sentence-related obligations.16 (SOR ¶ 1.h).  
 
In November 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI (after he had 
been out drinking at a bar with his friends, and swerved his vehicle). A court found him 
guilty of DUI sometime in 2015, sentenced him to two years in jail (all but 200 days

suspended), ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service and to install an 
ignition interlock device (IID) on his vehicle for three years, fined him $1,000, and 
placed him on probation for two years. He served part of his jail time on house arrest.17 
(SOR ¶ 1.i). 
 
Applicant’s consumption of alcohol from 1977 through present has varied. He 
began consuming alcohol at age 18. His heaviest drinking occurred during his time in 
the Navy. Following each DUI, he would modify his alcohol consumption. He abstained 
from consuming any alcohol for at least 14 months between 1994 and 1995, for a year 
approximately five years ago, and while prohibited from doing so during his probation 
for his 1998 and 2011 DUIs and his house arrest for the 2014 DUI. Prior to his 2014 
DUI, he consumed approximately four or five beers per night, and since then 
approximately one or two beers per night. He has not consumed alcohol to the point of 
intoxication since his 2014 DUI. At the hearing, Applicant reported that he further 
reduced his alcohol consumption to a couple of beers while bowling and maybe a beer 
at home.18 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant proclaimed that did not have a problem with alcohol, nor 
was he ever an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. As such, he has no future intent to 
participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings or any other alcohol counseling. 
Applicant attended 14 AA meetings prior to the court date for his 2014 DUI at the 
suggestion of his attorney, who thought it would benefit his case. A licensed alcohol 
counselor evaluated Applicant during three sessions at his office in May 2015, and did 
not assess him to have a substance abuse disorder. In August and October 2015, a 
licensed alcohol counselor evaluated Applicant, diagnosed him as an alcohol abuser, 
and recommended that he participate in group therapy for relapse prevention and 
recovery promotion.19 
 
Applicant attributed his DUI history to a failure to realize that he was too impaired 
to drive.20 He averred that the IID helps him to better gauge how many alcoholic 
beverages will impair his driving ability because it locks his vehicle whenever his BAC 
registers above a certain limit. On at least three or four occasions (most recently in 
approximately January 2017), the vehicle locked because his BAC was over the limit. 
On those occasions, he either waited until his BAC dropped or had someone else drive 
him home. Once his IID is removed, Applicant claimed, alternatively, that he will either 
not drive at all if he has been drinking any amount of alcohol, or will not drive if he has 
more than one alcoholic beverage. Applicant claimed that he does not intend to repeat 
his past mistakes with respect to drinking and driving because he has “lost too much” 
and wants to be present for his youngest child, who has special needs.21

Guideline E 
 
On March 12, 2015, Applicant signed SCA1 certifying that the statements made 
therein were “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and 
[were] made in good faith.” On March 13, 2016, he signed SCA2 certifying same. He 
was interviewed in connection with his security-clearance investigation on May 1st and 
7th of 2015 to discuss, among other things, the contents of SCA1. He completed SCA1 
in connection with a ten-year periodic reinvestigation, which was never completed. He 
completed SCA2 in order to restart the reinvestigation.22 
 
In section 22 (Police Record) of SCA1 and SCA2,23 Applicant reported his 2011 
and 2014 DUI arrests. However, he answered “No” to the question of whether, in 
addition to his listed arrests, he had “EVER been charged with an offense involving 
alcohol or drugs” and otherwise failed to report his alcohol-related arrests in 1987, 1992, 
1993 and 1998 (SOR ¶ 2.c).24  
 
In section 24 (Use of Alcohol) of SCA1 and SCA2, Applicant answered “No” to 
the question of whether he had EVER “been ordered, advised, or asked to seek 
counseling or treatment as a result of [his] use of alcohol . . . voluntarily sought 
counseling or treatment as a result of [his] use of alcohol . . . [or] received counseling or 
treatment as a result of [his] use of alcohol in addition to what [he had] already listed . . . 
.”25 He did not otherwise report either his court-ordered or voluntary alcohol counseling 
or treatment in connection with his 1992 DUI, as alleged, and otherwise.26 (SOR ¶ 2.b).  
 
During his May 1, 2015 interview, Applicant discussed only his 2011 and 2014 
DUIs, referring to his 2011 DUI as his “first DUI.” After being confronted during his May 
7, 2015 interview, Applicant acknowledged and discussed his 1998 DUI but “could not 
remember” a 1993 DUI. He claimed that he did not list the 1998 DUI on SCA1 because 
he “forgot about it.”27 
 
Applicant claimed that he never intended to falsify SCA1 and “tried putting 
everything down that [he] could possibly think of.” He also claimed that he had problems 
completing it and sought out human resources to assist him. He complained about it 
being “long,” and although he was not rushed to complete it, he had to take the time to

find a lot of information that needed updating since his prior SCA. Concerning the 
alcohol counseling and treatment questions in section 24, Applicant claimed, 
alternatively, that he misunderstood the question and did not think it was asking about 
his “court-mandated” counseling and treatment, and that he forgot about his “voluntary” 
treatment.28  
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”29 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”30 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”31 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”32 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance.

 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.33 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”34 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.35 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.36 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.37 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”38 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”39 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) 
 
 The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 21:  
 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. 
 
 Applicant’s history of excessive alcohol consumption, including four DUI 
convictions between 1992 and 2014, establish the following disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving 
while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the 
peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the 
individual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with 
alcohol use disorder; and 
 
                                                          
33 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
34 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
35 See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). 
 
36 Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
37 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
38 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). 
 
39 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
9 
 
AG ¶ 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with 
alcohol use disorder. 
 
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant did not specifically admit to the allegation 
that he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 1994. He specifically denied it at the 
hearing. Therefore, that fact is controverted. In light of the record, the Government did 
not meet its burden to prove it. Moreover, even if it had, I do not find it disqualifying. 
Because none of the disqualifying conditions apply to the facts alleged therein, I find 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.j. in favor of Applicant. Receiving alcohol treatment alone (SOR ¶ 
1.e) is not a security concern. Applicant was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser in 2015, 
but not as alcohol dependent in 1994 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant’s continued consumption 
of alcohol, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j., is not itself a security concern unless it is preceded 
by a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (under the 2017 AG).40  
 
 The security concerns raised under this guideline have not been mitigated by 
either of the following applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, 
or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or judgment; and 
 
AG ¶ 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive 
alcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, 
and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified 
consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment 
recommendations. 
  
 Applicant’s four DUI convictions spanned a 22-year period, most recently in 
2014. He is not able to drive his vehicle without an IID through at least 2018. While the 
IID is helping Applicant understand the effect alcohol consumption has on his ability to 
drive, it is too soon to tell for how long its impact will last. In light of his DUI history, 
Applicant has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to 
conclude that the questionable judgment associated with his excessive alcohol 
consumption is behind him.  
 
                                                          
40 I considered that Applicant’s 2015 alcohol-abuse diagnosis and continued alcohol consumption 
thereafter could have established security concerns under the 2006 AG. AG ¶¶ 22(d), (e), and (f). 
However, because the SOR did not allege the 2015 diagnosis, it and his continued alcohol consumption 
would have been relevant only to my evaluation of mitigation and whole person. Whether alleged or not, I 
would have still concluded that Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline G concern as I have under the 
2017 AG.  
 
 
10 
 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result 
in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security 
clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security 
eligibility: 
 
(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo 
or cooperate with security processing, including but not 
limited to meeting with a security investigator for subject 
interview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation 
with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph 
examination, if authorized and required; and 
 
(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to 
lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other 
official representatives in connection with a personnel 
security or trustworthiness determination. 
 
Notwithstanding my adverse determination under Guideline G, Applicant’s history 
of excessive alcohol consumption also raises concerns under Guideline E. While none 
of the listed disqualifying conditions under this guideline strictly applies, I find that his 
conduct establishes the general concerns involving questionable judgment and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, which Applicant has not mitigated.41 
 
When a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of 
proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant’s state of 
mind at the time of the omission.42 An applicant’s level of education and business 
experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information 
on a security clearance application was deliberate.43

are not exclusive [citation omitted]. To the contrary, they are illustrative in nature, and, even when none of 
the DC’s under a particular Guideline can be applied with literal preciseness, it is not improper for a Judge 
to conclude that an applicant’s conduct sets forth concerns under that Guideline).

Applicant intentionally falsified materially relevant facts on SCA1, which 
establishes the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national 
security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
The security concerns raised under this guideline have not been mitigated  
by either of the following applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the 
facts; and  
 
AG ¶ 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
Applicant’s failure to report his entire alcohol-related arrest history or any of his 
alcohol counseling and treatment history on SCA1 is security significant, especially in 
light of his familiarity with the clearance process. Not only has he maintained a security 
clearance for a significant period of time, undergone several investigations, but he also 
appeared previously before a DOHA judge who adjudicated an SOR involving 
substantially similar SCA falsification allegations. I did not find credible his explanations 
and excuses for failing to report these materially relevant facts on his SCA1.  
 
Not only did Applicant fail to avail himself of the opportunity to correct his 
omissions before being confronted during his 2015 interviews, but he also failed to do 
so on SCA2. The fact that he referred to his 2011 DUI as his “first” DUI is troubling 
given the facts and circumstances of his earlier DUI arrest history. Although not alleged 
in the SOR, I find that his omissions and falsifications during his 2015 interviews and on 
SCA2 further evince Applicant’s intent to exclude materially relevant information from 
SCA1. Given these facts, I find substantial evidence of an intent on the part of the 
Applicant to omit, conceal, and falsify security-significant facts from and on SCA1. I 
have serious doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment 
based not only upon his falsification of SCA1 but also his history of excessive alcohol 
consumption.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and E in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and E, and evaluating all the evidence in 
the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his history of excessive alcohol consumption (including four DUI 
convictions between 1992 and 2014), and his deliberate omission of security-significant 
information from SCA1. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f – 1.i:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.b – 2.c:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
