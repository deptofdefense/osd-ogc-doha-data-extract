KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for 
access to classified information. Applicant mitigated the security concern raised by her 
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on December 10, 2014. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On March 4, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
2 
 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on April 13, 2016, and requested a decision based on the 
written record without a hearing.   
 
On September 19, 2016, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant September 20, 2016. She was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on October 3, 2016.3 Applicant 
did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 1, 2017.  
 
Because of the age of this case, I sua sponte reopened the record on July 25, 
2017, and so advised Applicant and Department Counsel. I did so to allow Applicant to 
(1) review the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (effective June 8, 2017), and (2) 
supplement the record to update the current status of her indebtedness. I left the record 
open until close of business August 18, 2017. By email dated August 18, 2017, Applicant 
submitted six documents, which I have marked as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through F, 
and which without objection are admitted into evidence.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were seven items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.4 Exhibits 1 through 3 and 5 are admitted into 
evidence. Exhibit 4 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interview 
that took place during the April 2015 background investigation. The ROI is not 
authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.5 Department Counsel’s 
written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not 
authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the authentication 
requirement. The footnote is prominently prefaced with a bolded, upper-case notice to 
                                                          
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My Decision and 
Formal Findings under the revised Guideline F would not be different under the 2006 Guideline F.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, 
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals’ (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 20, 2016, and 
Applicant’s receipt is dated October 3, 2016. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 
30 days after receiving it to submit information.   
 
4 The first item in the FORM is the SOR, and the second item is Applicant’s Answer. Because the SOR and 
the Answer are the pleadings in this case, they are not marked as Exhibits. Items 3 through 7 are marked 
as Exhibits 1 through 5.  
 
5 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Applicant and flagging for Applicant the importance of the footnote, which then explains 
the concepts of authentication and waiver. In a case such as this, where Applicant has 
responded to the FORM (although belatedly, after I reopened the record), it is fair to 
conclude that Applicant read the footnote, understood it, and chose not to object to the 
ROI. The ROI is, therefore, admissible.   
  
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 31 years old and a high school graduate with some college credits. 
She is unmarried but has a long-time boyfriend/cohabitant.6 Applicant has two daughters 
ages 8 and 11 who live with her and her boyfriend. Since January 2003, Applicant has 
been employed by a defense contractor.7  
 
The SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling $14,437. In her answer, Applicant 
admitted those debts and submitted documents showing the resolution of some of them. 
She showed evidence that she has resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.a, d, e, i, l, and m, totaling $9,264. 
The documents Applicant submitted in response to the reopening of the record showed 
that she has resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.b, c, k, and n, totaling $563. As for the remaining debts, 
Applicant provided documents evidencing her good-faith efforts to repay those overdue 
debts.  
 
Applicant attributes her financial problems to her boyfriend’s unexpected loss of 
employment and his income in 2014. This is consistent with Applicant’s credit history.8 As 
of her background interview in April 2015, he still was unemployed but actively looking for 
another job. Three of the debts are for medical accounts incurred when one of her 
daughters needed to be hospitalized for asthma.9    
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.10 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”11 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
                                                          
6 Applicant’s security clearance application said that they began living together in January 2003. GE 1. In 
her interview, she said they began living together in May 2005. GE 4. In any event, this is a long-time 
relationship. 
 
7 GE 1.  
 
8 GE 3.  
 
9 GE 4. Those medical debts total $248 for which there was apparently no insurance coverage.   
 
10 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to 
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a 
security clearance).

whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.12 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.13 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.14 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.15 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.16 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.17 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.18 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.19 
 
     Discussion 
  
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,20 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.21

 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial 
history going back to 2014. This raises security concerns under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).  The 
next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  
 
  Applicant’s boyfriend has been a long-time contributor to the household finances. 
His unexpected loss of employment in 2014 is a condition completely beyond Applicant’s 
control. AG ¶ 20(b) applies, subject to inquiring whether Applicant acted responsibly 
under the adverse circumstances she faced. By payment, payment plans, or otherwise, 
Applicant reduced the SOR debts from $14,437 to $4,600. That shows responsible 
conduct under AG ¶ 20(b). It also shows that AG ¶ 20(d) applies.22 An applicant is not 
required to show that every debt in the SOR has been paid. Rather, an applicant is 
required to demonstrate that he or she has “established a plan to resolve his [or her] 
                                                          
 
22 In my view, having less than $300 of unresolved medical debt does not reflect adversely on Applicant’s 
suitability for a security clearance.

financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.”23 The dramatic 
debt reduction that Applicant has achieved is evidence of a successful plan.  
 
The record does not raise doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion 
to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for 
access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.n:                   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant access to classified information.
