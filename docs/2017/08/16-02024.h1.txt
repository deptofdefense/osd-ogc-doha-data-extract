Decision 
______________ 
 
MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 3, 2015 
(SCA). On August 15, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guidelines F, H, J, and G. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on September 10, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 
27, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on January 25, 2017. On February 28, 
2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the 
hearing was scheduled for March 30, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  
 
2 
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were admitted into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record a letter the Government sent to Applicant as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted into 
evidence, without objection. Two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. At 
Applicant’s request, I left the record open to April 13, 2017. Applicant timely provided 
additional documents that I admitted into evidence as AE B and C, without objection. 
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2017. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG.1 Accordingly, I have applied 
the June 2017 AG.2 However, because the September 2006 AG were in effect on the 
date of the hearing, I have also considered the September 2006 AG. Having considered 
both versions of the AG, I conclude that my decision would have been the same had I 
applied the September 2006 AG. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 38, has been separated from his wife of 10 years since 2014. He 
has one daughter, age 16, and one son, age 18. He received his high school diploma in 
1997. He honorably served in the U.S. Army for two months in 1999. He is a sheet 
metal worker employed by the same defense contractor (Employer A) on and off for 
almost 13 years. He has held a security clearance since 2005.  
 
Employer A placed Applicant under notice of layoff on numerous occasions and 
laid him off three times. The first layoff period was March 2007 through April 2008; the 
second, March 2012 through May 2012; and the third, October 2012 through November 
2012. During the first layoff period, he was able to secure alternate employment for 
approximately five months. He received unemployment compensation during each 
period that he was unemployed.4  
 
The SOR contains four allegations under Guideline F involving a mortgage-loan 
foreclosure with a deficiency balance of $135,000 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and three medical debts 
(two judgments and one collection account) totaling $801 (SOR ¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d). It 
also contains allegations and cross-allegations under Guideline H (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b), 
J (SOR ¶¶ 3.a through 3.f), and G (SOR ¶¶ 4.a), primarily involving Applicant’s 
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD-4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD-4 ¶ B, Purpose).  The 
SEAD-4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD-4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which are found at Appendix A to SEAD-4, apply to determine eligibility for 
initial or continued access to classified national security information.  (SEAD-4 ¶ C, Applicability).

excessive alcohol consumption and marijuana use. In his SOR answer, Applicant 
denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d ($70, medical account in collection status) on the 
basis that it was unknown to him. He admitted the remaining allegations. The credit 
reports establish the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.5 
 
Financial 
 
 Applicant purchased a $217,000 home with his wife in March 2007. They 
financed 100% of the purchase price through an adjustable-rate loan with Lender A. 
Applicant deposited his paycheck into a joint account from which his wife agreed to 
make the monthly loan payments. In about 2009 or 2010, Applicant learned that the 
loan was in default. Applicant attributed the default to his wife not making payments, 
and the loan’s interest rate increasing to an amount that they could not afford.6  
 
Despite Applicant’s years-long efforts to modify the loan, in approximately April 
2014, Lender A initiated foreclosure proceedings. Lender A was granted a foreclosure 
judgment in April 2015 and took possession of the property in July 2015. Applicant 
remains indebted to Lender A for a deficiency balance owed on the loan in the 
approximate amount of $135,000 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant has not contacted Lender A to 
resolve the debt, nor does he intend to since he does not want to trigger action by 
Lender A to collect the debt. If Lender A contacted him, Applicant would endeavor to 
arrange an affordable payment plan to resolve the debt.7 
 
 Although he has considered it, Applicant would prefer not to file bankruptcy for 
fear that it would negatively impact his security clearance, and because he would rather 
attempt to take care of his debts on his own.8 When he was contacted by a creditor six 
months ago about an unpaid $1,000 electric bill incurred by his wife, he immediately 
negotiated a monthly payment agreement, which satisfied the debt in full in March 
2017.9 
 
 Applicant attributed all of his alleged and unalleged medical debt to services 
rendered by Hospital A and Hospital B to either his wife or children.10 Hospital A 
obtained a $594 judgment in June 2012 (not alleged), which was satisfied through an 
involuntary garnishment in June 2016. Hospital B obtained a $494 stipulated judgment 
in June 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and a $237 default judgment in March 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.b), 
both of which were resolved by garnishment. A medical creditor, which Applicant

believed to be either Hospital A or Hospital B, obtained a $418 judgment in July 2012 
(not alleged). An unspecified medical creditor placed a $70 account in collection status 
in December 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.d).11 
 
 During his 2016 security-clearance interview, Applicant believed the $70 debt to 
be included among those owed to either Hospital A or Hospital B. However, in his 
answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he claimed no knowledge of the creditor. He has 
not disputed the debt, and promised to pay it once the creditor is known. However, as of 
the hearing date, he had not made any effort to determine who the creditor is.12 
 
 Applicant has not sought or received financial counseling. He earns $29.39 per 
hour working full time, with “very limited” opportunities for overtime which, at most, 
average two or three days per month. In 2016, he earned an annual salary of about 
$50,000 to $60,000. He does not have a savings account as he lives “paycheck to 
paycheck.” Applicant financed a $480 purchase by opening a retail credit card with a 
credit limit of $500 in April 2016. By July 2016, he was past due on his payment to that 
creditor, and also on his car payment.13 
 
Marijuana Use and Criminal Conduct 
 
 Applicant was arrested twice for incidents involving marijuana, in May 2008 (SOR 
¶ 3.f) and May 2013 (SOR ¶ 3.c). At the time of his 2008 arrest, he was in possession of 
marijuana as a passenger while parked in a vehicle with co-workers. Although he had 
planned to smoke the marijuana, he had not yet done so when he was arrested. At the 
time of his 2013 arrest, he had been smoking marijuana while parked in a vehicle with 
Friend A and remained in possession of it. In each instance, Applicant was charged with 
possession of marijuana to which he pled guilty. Applicant held an active security 
clearance in May 2013 (SOR ¶ 2.a). His clearance was inactive in April 2008 because 
he was not working for Employer A at the time.14  
 
Although he knew that marijuana use was prohibited while he held a security 
clearance, Applicant did not think about that on the occasion of his use in 2013. He 
attributed that use to stress related to his separation and financial situation, during 
which time he “was [not] thinking straight.” Applicant continued to associate with Friend 
A through at least March 2016. At his hearing, he stated that they now remain in contact 
only occasionally through social media. He has not used marijuana since May 2013.15

Criminal Conduct 
  
 Applicant was charged twice with breach of peace, in October 2011 (SOR ¶ 3.e) 
and July 2015 for which he was also arrested (SOR ¶ 3.b). 
  
 In October 2011, while attending his son’s football game, Applicant became 
upset about the coach’s calls and his son’s playing time and verbally argued about it 
with the league’s vice president so loudly and with such profanity that a third party 
bystander called the police. As Applicant approached the police officer, he “used the F 
bomb,” for which he was charged with breach of the peace. The court fined him $70. 
Since then, Applicant has not had any similar incidents at either of his children’s 
sporting events.16 
 
In July 2015, Applicant verbally argued and exchanged profanities with an 
individual who was upset that he lingered in a parking lot while dropping off a friend with 
whom the individual did not get along. The argument escalated when the individual, 
armed with a pipe, smashed the hood of Applicant’s car, and then swung it at him seven 
or eight times. The argument began while Applicant was inside of his car and continued 
after he exited the car, which he acknowledged was a mistake. Applicant sustained 
bruising to his body and, because he used it to block the pipe from hitting his head, 
severe injury to his hand, which required reconstructive surgery involving twelve screws 
and two plates. His hand has never fully recovered. Although he was charged with 
breach of the peace for being involved in the incident (SOR ¶ 1.b), the court ultimately 
dismissed it after identifying him as the victim of the assault.17 
 
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct 
 
Applicant was arrested and charged twice for driving while under the influence of 
alcohol (DUI), in July 2012 (SOR ¶ 3.d) and August 2015 (SOR ¶ 3.a).  
  
 In July 2012, Applicant had consumed approximately one alcoholic beverage 
(either a beer or a shot) per hour over the course of about 10 hours while at a bar with 
friends. Because he thought his friends were “more intoxicated than he was” and he had 
stopped drinking a few hours prior, he believed he was okay to drive everyone home. 
He was pulled over by law enforcement for speeding. After failing a field sobriety test, 
he was arrested, charged with DUI, and taken to jail. In October 2014, a court found him 
guilty of the charge, sentenced him to 364 days in jail (with all but one day suspended), 
fined him $5,000, ordered him to install an ignition interlock system (IIS) on his vehicle 
for an unspecified period of time, and placed him on probation for five years.18

Applicant’s vehicle.  
 
 
6 
 
 In August 2015, Applicant had consumed “more than a few” alcoholic beverages 
during the day while at home to cope with stress he was under at the time. At the same 
time, he had taken Percocet for the hand injury he sustained in July 2015. He left home 
in an agitated state while his “adrenaline was up” and drove a vehicle. Because he was 
driving slow and entered the highway the wrong way, he was pulled over by law 
enforcement. After “significantly” failing a field sobriety test, he was arrested, charged 
with DUI, and taken to jail where he remained overnight. In January 2016, the court 
sentenced Applicant, who pled guilty, to six months in jail (all but 15 days suspended), 
fined him $1,000, ordered him to complete a treatment program, and placed him on 
supervised probation for 18 months, which was scheduled to terminate in July 2017 
assuming he was compliant with the conditions of his probation. He is prohibited from 
consuming alcohol while on probation.19 
 
 In addition to the court-ordered treatment for his 2015 DUI, which he completed 
by attending a 12-week program, Applicant voluntarily attended an alcohol treatment 
program for an unspecified period following his 2012 arrest, and Alcohol Anonymous 
(AA) meetings for about six months following his 2015 arrest. At the hearing, Applicant 
claimed that he had last consumed alcohol a few days after his 2015 arrest. However, 
as of his March 2016 security-clearance interview, he reported then consuming alcohol 
approximately twice a week, but was not driving after any consumption. Nevertheless, 
at the hearing, he professed an intent not to consume alcohol in the future. He believes 
that he will be successful because of the tools he learned through AA and during his 
2015 DUI treatment program, which he has since applied. He has been able to socialize 
with others who are consuming alcohol without doing so himself, and has learned to 
have fun without it.20 
  
Whole Person 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant accepted full responsibility for the poor judgment 
revealed by his excessive consumption of alcohol and marijuana use. He maintained 
that he has changed his behavior and found other outlets to manage stressful situations 
to which he attributed his past errors in judgment. Applicant’s two children have resided 
with him full time since November 2016. As such, he has been their primary caregiver. 
His son’s biological father has never been around so Applicant has raised his son from 
the time he was six-months old. He continued to provide for his children financially after 
his separation from their mother, including a voluntarily monthly child support payment 
of $200 while they lived separately from him. He also provides health insurance for 
them and his wife, and pays for other expenses incurred by the children, as needed.21 
  
Applicant volunteered to serve as a union steward at his place of employment in 
the summer of 2016. His chief steward (Witness A) and another union leader (Witness

B), both of whom work with him daily, praised his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. Witness A, who has also known Applicant personally on and off for 30 years, 
said that Applicant has become his “best steward” in the relatively short time he has 
held the position. Witness A reported that Applicant is highly regarded by his peers and 
superiors. Witness B, who has known Applicant as a co-worker and friend for 
approximately ten years, also praised Applicant’s work performance. Both Witness A 
and B lauded Applicant’s evolution over the past three or four years into a responsible 
man who has moved well beyond the mistakes of his past.22 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”23 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”24 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”25 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”26 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met

the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.27 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”28 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.29 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.30 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.31 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”32 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”33 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .

33 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
9 
 
 Applicant’s financial indebtedness establishes the following disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG ¶ 19(c): a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 None of the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are 
established: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
Applicant’s $70 medical debt is not security significant on its own, especially as 
to the amount owed. However, together with his $135,000 mortgage debt, it evinces 
Applicant’s irresponsibility towards his financial obligations. Although I find in favor of 
Applicant as to the medical-account judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, the fact 
that they were resolved by involuntary garnishments further underscores the concern. 
While his marital separation, three layoffs, and wife’s failure to pay the mortgage were 
circumstances beyond his control, Applicant failed to take any proactive steps to resolve 
his mortgage deficiency or to ascertain information that would enable him to pay his 
unknown medical creditor. I credit Applicant with the pre-foreclosure efforts he made to 
resolve his delinquent mortgage account and with recently resolving his wife’s electric 
bill in a responsible manner. However, those efforts are insufficient to overcome his 
inaction with respect to the mortgage deficiency and medical debt. At this time, 
Applicant’s finances are not under control and a substantial debt remains unresolved. 
 
Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 24: “The illegal use of 
controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, 
and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used 
in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to 
 
10 
 
physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's 
ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance 
means any "controlled substance" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the 
generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.”  
 
Applicant’s possession of marijuana in 2008 and his use of marijuana in 2013 
while in possession of security clearance establish the following disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  
 
AG ¶ 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including 
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or 
possession of drug paraphernalia; and 
 
AG ¶ 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified 
information or holding a sensitive position. 
 
The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are established: 
 
AG ¶ 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and 
 
AG ¶ 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and 
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this 
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not 
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) 
changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) 
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement 
and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or 
misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. 
 
Applicant’s marijuana use in 2013 while holding a security clearance is troubling. 
However, Applicant has not used marijuana in over four years and acknowledged its 
incompatibility with his maintenance of a security clearance. He accepted full 
responsibility for his marijuana use and possession, not only during the hearing but also 
with respect to his earlier legal consequences. Applicant and his witnesses credibly 
testified that he has substantially changed the behaviors and circumstances underlying 
his marijuana use and possession such that I conclude that they are not likely to recur.  
 
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) 
 
 The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 30: Criminal activity creates 
doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it 
 
11 
 
calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
 
 Applicant’s record of arrests and charges between 2008 and 2015, together with 
the associated court dispositions, establish the following disqualifying conditions under 
this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own 
would be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which 
in combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness; 
 
AG ¶ 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; 
and 
 
AG ¶ 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. 
 
The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 32 (c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed 
the offence; and 
 
AG ¶ 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but 
not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, 
restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or 
higher education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
 
 AG ¶ 32 (c) is established to fully mitigate the 2015 breach of peace charge. 
Applicant’s criminal misconduct involving the other five allegations under Guideline J 
spans a seven-year period. Arguably, one or more of these five incidents would lack 
security significance if viewed in isolation. However, they collectively establish a pattern 
of behavior that casts doubt about Applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, 
and calls into question his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and 
regulations. Assuming that Applicant completed his probation for his second DUI in July 
2017, he remains on probation for his first DUI, which is not scheduled to end until 
2019. Based on all the evidence, there has not been a passage of time sufficient to 
conclude that Applicant’s criminal misconduct will not recur. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) are 
not established. 
 
 
12 
 
Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) 
 
 The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 21: Excessive alcohol 
consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to 
control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and 
trustworthiness. 
 
 Applicant’s excessive alcohol consumption, resulting in his 2008 and 2015 DUIs, 
establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving 
while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the 
peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the 
individual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with 
alcohol use disorder; and 
 
AG ¶ 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with 
alcohol use disorder. 
 
 Neither of the applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are 
established: 
 
AG ¶ 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, 
or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or judgment; and 
 
AG ¶ 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive 
alcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, 
and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified 
consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment 
recommendations. 
  
 The security significance of Applicant’s dated 2012 DUI is brought current by his 
recent 2015 DUI. Together they evince a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that 
raises questions about Applicant’s good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Of 
particular concern is the fact that he was arrested for his second DUI, within a year of 
the conviction for his first DUI, and while on probation for his first DUI. Although 
Applicant and his witnesses credibly testified that he has changed the behaviors 
underlying his excessive alcohol consumption, it is too soon to tell whether those 
changes will endure once his IIS is removed and probation terminates. In light of his 
DUI history, Applicant has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for 
me to conclude that the questionable judgment associated with his excessive alcohol 
consumption is behind him.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, J, and G in my whole-
person analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Applicant is devoted to 
his children and highly regarded by his employer. He was candid, sincere, and contrite 
at the hearing. Undoubtedly, the stressors of his marriage and finances contributed to 
the misconduct alleged in the SOR. While Applicant has made significant strides to 
rehabilitate himself, Applicant has not carried his heavy burden of overcoming his 
extensive history of questionable judgment.34 After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, H, J, and G, and evaluating all the evidence in 
the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his drug involvement, but not as to his financial indebtedness, 
excessive alcohol consumption, and criminal misconduct. Accordingly, Applicant has 
not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.”ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3
