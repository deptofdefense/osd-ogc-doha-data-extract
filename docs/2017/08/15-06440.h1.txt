Decision 
___________ 
 
TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining under Guideline F (financial 
consideration). Clearance is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On November 6, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF-86). On February 28, 2016, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, which became effective on 
September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On April 8, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. On July 1, 2016, Department 
Counsel was prepared to proceed. On August 4, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
 
2 
                                         
 
and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On September 27, 2016, DOHA issued a 
notice of the hearing, setting the hearing on October 24, 2016. The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, 
which were received into evidence without objection. Applicant did not call any witnesses, 
testified, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P, which were received without 
objection. On November 1, 2016, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). I held the 
record open until November 30 2016, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence. 
Applicant timely submitted AE Q(1) through Q(11), which were received without objection. 
Applicant also submitted four DOHA case citations, that were marked as Exhibits (Ex) I 
through IV for administrative notice purposes. 
 
On December 13, 2016, I forwarded an e-mail to Department Counsel and 
Applicant stating that I intended to issue a summary decision granting Applicant’s security 
clearance. On the same day, Department Counsel replied by e-mail stating without 
elaboration that the Government objected to issuance of a summary decision in this case. 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs) which he made applicable to all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for 
all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs, as required.1 
 
                                           Procedural Matters 
 
Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to read, “You failed to file your 
(Federal) income tax returns for at least tax years 2005 through 2014.” Without objection 
from Applicant’s counsel, I granted Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 59-60) 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the sole SOR allegation, with 
explanations. Applicant’s admission is accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of 
fact follow.

Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old junior engineer employed by a defense contractor since 
October 2011. He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his current employment. 
He previously held a secret security clearance for approximately five years with a former 
employer in the 1990s. (Tr. 12-15, 17-18) 
 
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1978. (Tr. 15) He was awarded an 
associate of arts degree in January 1982, and attended a four-year university from 
January 1990 to January 1992, but did not earn a degree. (Tr. 15-16, 54) He has never 
married and has no dependents. (Tr. 16-17)  He did not serve in the U.S. armed forces. 
(Tr. 17) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2005 through 2014. (SOR ¶ 1.a) This allegation is established 
through Applicant’s admissions; his November 6, 2014 SF-86; his April 9, 2015 Office of 
Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); and his hearing 
testimony. (GE 1, GE 2) 
 
Applicant stated in his SOR answer, his SF-86, and his OPM PSI, that he did not 
file his federal income taxes because he always had the maximum withholdings withheld 
from his pay and did not owe any taxes. (SOR answer, GE1, GE 2) He reiterated that 
point in his testimony stating that he always had maximum payroll withholdings and had 
“no financial obligation in terms of liability.” Furthermore, he never owed the IRS money 
and had he filed, he would have received a refund. He stated, “…, I know it sounds maybe 
unusual, but I felt that that was a good cause, if you will. So, I forfeited those returns.” (Tr. 
19) Alternatively stated, Applicant believed that since he was owed a refund, he was not 
required to file.  
 
Department Counsel thoroughly questioned Applicant on this point. Applicant 
never wavered in his belief that he was not required to file a tax return if owed a refund. 
(Tr. 27-52) Applicant’s counsel questioned him further on this point and his testimony 
remained the same. (Tr. 55-59) Having had a chance to observe Applicant’s demeanor 
and listen to his testimony, I found him to be credible, albeit mistaken.  
 
When Applicant was informed that he was required to file his federal income tax 
returns, regardless of whether he was due a refund, he took immediate corrective action. 
(Tr. 19-20) In 2016, he hired an accountant and filed all required tax returns with the IRS, 
which in his case was for the previous seven years. (Tr. 20-22) Applicant submitted copies 
of his income tax returns for tax years 2009 to 2015, corroborating what he has been 
stating from the onset, that the IRS owed him a refund for every year he did not file. 
Broken down by year, a summary of refunds follows:  2009 - $520;  2010 - $641; 2011 - 
$1,307; 2012 - $1,130; 2013 - $1,054; 2014 - $1,974; 2015 - $982 (Tr. 20-21; AE B – AE 
P, AE Q(3) - AE Q(8)) Tax returns filed more than three years late are not eligible for 
 
4 
                                         
 
refunds. Applicant provided copies of IRS refund checks for tax years 2012 – 2015. (AE 
A, AE Q(1)) In short, Applicant is now current on all of his Federal income tax obligations.  
 
Applicant lives in a mobile home that he owns outright. Similarly, his automobile is 
paid for. Applicant’s budget reflects that he lives within his means and leads a modest 
lifestyle. His net monthly remainder is $2,824 and he has approximately $80,000 in his 
savings account. (Tr. 22, 61-62; AE Q(2)) He lives in a farming community and his family 
has a long-standing farming tradition. For a hobby, he grows vegetables and sells them 
at a local farmer’s market. (Tr. 23-26) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant’s 2016 annual performance review reflects sustained superior 
performance. It is clear from his performance review that his company views him as a 
valued employee. (AE Q(9)). Applicant submitted a personal and professional reference 
letter from an individual who has known him for 34 years. This individual described 
Applicant as loyal, hardworking, and professional.  (AE Q(10)) Additionally, Applicant’s 
employer recognized him with a technical award for submitting a work-related provisional 
patent application. (AE Q(11)) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
 
5 
                                         
 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
 
6 
                                         
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax 
returns . . . as required.” The record establishes the disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 19(f), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2005 to 
2014. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.3 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns 
against him as a federal crime, since his actions were not alleged under the criminal 
conduct AG.  
 
Two financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are applicable: 
“(a) the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;” and “(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.”  
 
 Applicant negligently failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 
2005 to 2014. He was due refunds for all of those tax years. The DOHA Appeal Board 
has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
                                            
3 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
7 
                                         
 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016)  
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when the tax returns were filed in ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance, “By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted 
access to classified information.” ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) 
(citations omitted).  
 
On June 8, 2017, the new AGs went into effect. In 2016, Applicant “made 
arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file [all required federal income tax 
returns] . . . and is in compliance with those arrangements.” AG ¶ 20(f). There is sufficient 
assurance that his financial problems are resolved, are under control, and will not recur 
in the future. Under all the circumstances, financial considerations security concerns are 
mitigated.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration” 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old junior engineer employed by a defense contractor since 
October 2011. His employer values him as an employee and supports him for a security 
clearance. Applicant successfully held a security clearance for five years during the 
1990s.  
 
Once Applicant became aware that he was required to file federal income tax 
returns, regardless of whether he was owed a refund, he took prompt corrective action. 
He is current on the filing of all of his income tax returns. I agree with Applicant’s 
admission of negligence; however, it is important to note that he was entitled to refunds 
for all of those tax years. Applicant’s error in judgment is less serious because it was not 
motivated by a desire to withhold funds due to the IRS. This process has had a sobering 
effect on Applicant and I am confident that he will endeavor to timely file and his taxes in 
the future.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865,  and the 
new AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly consistent with 
the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
