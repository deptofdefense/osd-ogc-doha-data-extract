MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns 
under Guideline F, financial considerations, about his unfiled tax returns, unpaid past-due 
taxes, and other delinquent debts. Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 8, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective 
within the DOD for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). The AGs 
 
2 
 
 
became effective on June 8, 2017, for all adjudicative decisions on or after that date. Any 
changes resulting from the implementation of the new AGs did not affect my decision in 
this case.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on July 1, 2016, and elected to have his case decided 
on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. On August 18, 2016, Department Counsel 
submitted the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents 
identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant received the FORM on August 31, 2016. He 
was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant’s undated response was received by the Defense 
Office of Hearings & Appeals (DOHA) on September 30, 2016. It was marked as Applicant 
Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. Applicant did not object to the 
government’s evidence. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in 
the case. Items 3 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection.  
 
The case was assigned to me on June 6, 2017. On June 8, 2017, I reopened the 
record to enable Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documents.1 On June 19, 
2017, Applicant sought and received additional time to respond.2 On June 21, 2017, I 
provided him a copy of the new AGs.3 He submitted additional documentation by e-mail 
on July 21, 2017, and July 27, 2017. Applicant’s e-mails and documents were marked AE 
B through AE J and admitted without objection.4    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
  Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. His 
admissions and other comments are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a 
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 50 years old. He was married from 1989-2010, and he remarried in 
2015. He has three children from his first marriage (ages 19, 21 and 25) and two 
stepchildren (ages 11 and 15).5 He earned an associate’s degree in 2001 through the 
military. He retired from the U.S. Air Force in 2009 as a master sergeant after 20 years of 
honorable service. He was granted a secret clearance in 2005.6   
                                                          
1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  
 
2 HE II 
 
3 HE III.  
 
4 Applicant’s July 21, 2017 e-mails (AE B & AE F) included two recommendation letters (AE C & AE D) and 
two pages of a July 21, 2017 letter from the IRS. (AE E). AE E was not a complete document, so I re-
opened the record to enable Applicant the opportunity to submit a complete exhibit, as well as other 
documentation. (HE IV) Applicant did so on July 27, 2017. (AE G – AE J). 
 
5 AE A.  
 
6 Item 3.  
 
3 
 
 
Since retiring from the Air Force, he has worked as an air traffic controller for his 
current employer in the defense industry. He submitted a security clearance application 
(SCA) in April 2015. He disclosed unfiled tax returns and delinquent debts, including 
consumer accounts, taxes and a mortgage.7   
 
 In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant: failed to file his state and 
federal tax returns for tax years 2012 -2014 (SOR ¶ 1.a);8 owed unpaid federal taxes to 
the IRS for 2010 and 2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, totaling $5,295); had a mortgage in 
foreclosure (SOR ¶ 1.f, for $144,000); a delinquent home improvement loan (SOR ¶ 1.g, 
for $24,391); and three other consumer debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e and 1.h, totaling $1,835).  
 
 In addressing his tax returns and past-due taxes in his answer, Applicant 
acknowledged that he failed to file tax returns for tax years 2012-2014. He indicated that 
he was in the process of finding a CPA (certified public accountant) to complete his taxes 
and that he was coordinating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a repayment 
plan. He stated, “I have no valid reason for not filing other than money the last 5 years 
has been very tight.”9 He indicated in his interview that he was living paycheck to 
paycheck and could not afford to pay or file his taxes. His former wife was granted half of 
his military retirement pay.10 
 
 For a time, Applicant was supporting two households: his own and his wife’s, in a 
neighboring state. He also incurred unspecified legal expenses not only from the divorce 
proceedings, but also from two DWI charges she incurred around this time. After the 
divorce, he was unable to maintain his home after a foreclosure. (SOR ¶ 1.f) A home 
improvement loan was also charged off. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He indicated that he was required 
to count the charged-off amount as income and report it on his tax returns. However, he 
provided no documentation concerning the current status of either debt.11  
 
 Applicant indicated that as of September 26, 2016, he had filed all of his past-due 
tax returns. He acknowledged owing back taxes and stated that beginning in October 
2016, he would be paying $297 a month until the debt was paid off. He had also adjusted 
his tax exemptions to zero. He provided no documentation with his FORM Response of 
any returns, and no documentation of any tax payments, towards either SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 
or later, unalleged tax years. (AE A) 
 
                                                          
 
7 Item 3.  
 
8 Applicant’s answer to SOR ¶ 1.a did not address state taxes. Since 2009, he has lived in Texas, a state 
that has no income tax. The Government did not establish that Applicant had a duty to file state tax returns. 
 
9 Item 2.  
 
10 Item 4 at 3.  
 
11 Item 2; AE A.  
 
 
4 
 
 
   
 On July 21, 2017, Applicant and his wife submitted an installment agreement to 
the IRS. (AE G) He indicated that this was “a new payment agreement to increase the 
amount I paid. With my 2016 taxes I was owed 3500 dollars and that went directly to my 
taxes. This will help me pay off my owed taxes more rapidly,” (AE F)  
 
The installment agreement covers past-due taxes owed for tax years 2010 and 
2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b & 1.c) as well as for tax years 2012-2016. Applicant acknowledged 
that he owed $26,321 in past-due taxes. Applicant is to pay $328 per month, by automatic 
withdrawal, beginning August 28, 2017. (AE H) The first payment includes a $225 “user 
fee.” (AE E).  
 
 The IRS’s correspondence references Applicant’s federal tax filings for tax years 
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. Tax year 2014 is not mentioned. (AE E, AE H)  
Applicant did not provide copies of his federal tax returns for tax years 2012-2014, though 
he indicated that he filed them by September 2016. (AE A).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a $1,317 past-due credit card debt. Applicant made five monthly 
payments on the account between March and July 2017, totaling $210. (AE I) This 
account is being resolved. SOR ¶ 1.h is a past-due energy bill for $80. Applicant submitted 
screenshots showing that the account is closed or inactive with no balance owed. (AE J) 
This account is resolved.  
 
Applicant provided no documentation about SOR ¶ 1.e, a $438 consumer debt, or 
about the foreclosed mortgage or the charged-off home equity loan (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g). 
These accounts remain unresolved.  
 
 Applicant indicated that he joined a financial counseling program at work. It offers 
help with weekly and monthly budgeting and weekly “webinars” on various financial 
situations. (AE A). He provided no documentation about assets, or his monthly income or 
expenses. 
  
 Applicant’s manager has worked with him for the past three years. She noted that 
he was recently promoted. She considers Applicant to be responsible, task-driven, and 
detail oriented. Another co-worker and friend has known and worked with Applicant since 
2009. He regards Applicant as competent, efficient and highly respected. He is a good 
leader. He is friendly and has good communication skills, so he relates well with others. 
He volunteers as a coach for young athletes in his community.12   
                                                          
12 AE C, AE D. Applicant also relies on the following statement from his interview summary: “There is 
nothing in the subject’s background or regarding the subject’s character or conduct that could result on 
exploitation, blackmail, or coercion to include his financial issue.”  AE A at 2; AE B (citing Item 4 at 4). He 
believes this is the conclusion of the investigator who interviewed him. That reliance is misplaced. The 
DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that such statements represent the interviewer’s summary of 
Applicant’s statements during the interview, not the interviewer’s opinion of Applicant’s status as a security 
risk. ISCR Case No. 14-04124 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 19, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-03069 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 
30, 2015); ISCR Case No. 12-02859 at 3 (May 16, 2014); ISCR Case No. 11-08118 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 
2013).

 Applicant described himself as a proud veteran and employee in the defense 
industry. He indicated that he understands the importance of living within his means and 
paying down his debts. He described himself as embarrassed and remorseful for finding 
himself in this position.13  
 
Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.14 As noted by 
the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”15 
  
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out 
in AG & 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .  
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified 
information.16 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and  
 
(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax 
returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. 
 
 Applicant accrued several delinquent debts after his retirement from the Air Force 
and his divorce. This included a foreclosed mortgage and a charged-off home equity loan, 
and several other debts. He also accrued unpaid federal income tax debt and for several 
years he failed to file his federal income tax returns as required. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c) and 
19(g) apply.  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file 
tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
                                                          
16 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).

judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). 
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
 Applicant paid SOR ¶ 1.h and is making payments on SOR ¶1.d. SOR ¶ 1.e 
remains unpaid. He did not provide documentation of the current status of SOR ¶¶ 1.f or 
1.g. 
  
 Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his tax returns for 2012-2014 (SOR 
¶ 1.a). He indicated in his FORM Response that that he had filed all his prior returns by 
September 26, 2016, and entered into an installment agreement to begin a month later. 
(AE A). He did not provide copies of any of his tax returns, and did not document any 
payments made. He did not document the September 2016 installment agreement.  
 
8 
 
 
 The only documentary evidence that Applicant has filed his late tax returns is the 
IRS’s July 2017 correspondence, which references tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 
2015. (AE E, AE H). I therefore infer that Applicant did file those returns, and that the IRS 
used the information from them in calculating what he owed. I cannot make that inference 
as to the 2014 tax return, which is not mentioned in AE E or AE H, and is also not in the 
record. 
 
 Applicant’s July 2017 installment agreement with the IRS covers $26,321 in past-
due taxes owed for tax years 2010 and 2011 (SOR ¶¶1.b and 1.c), as well as for 
subsequent years (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015). (AE G, AE H) His first payment, of $328, 
is to be made on August 28, 2017. (AE H). 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems began in about 2010, after he retired from the Air 
Force. For a time, he maintained the expenses of two households, as he and his wife 
began living separate lives. He had unspecified legal expenses relating to the divorce, as 
well as for her two DWI charges. These were circumstances beyond his control which 
impacted his finances. His home was foreclosed, and a home equity loan was charged 
off. He also fell behind on his taxes and other debts. The first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) applies.  
 
 For full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. He has not shown sufficient evidence that he acted 
responsibly. While he acknowledged that he could not afford to pay his taxes (or other 
debts), he also failed to file his federal tax returns as required for at least three years 
(2012-2014). These returns were due in April 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively – three 
years or more after he was divorced. He also was gainfully employed at all times during 
this period. Even though his debts occurred as a result of his divorce, I cannot find that 
he has acted responsibly in resolving them. AG ¶ 20(b) does not fully apply.  
 
Applicant indicated that he pursued financial counseling through his employer. 
However, he provided insufficient information to establish that his financial problems are 
being resolved or is under control. AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply.  
 
 Applicant provided no documents concerning his current financial situation, such 
as his assets or his monthly income or expenses. There is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. His past-due tax debt is 
significant and remains ongoing. He has only recently begun making a serious effort to 
resolve it. These debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
I cannot find that either AG ¶ 20(d) or 20(g) fully applies. Applicant acknowledged 
that he failed to timely file his federal tax returns as required for tax years 2012, 2013, 
2014 (as alleged) and 2015 (not alleged, but which he acknowledged filing late). (AE A) 
He owes approximately $26,321 (covering tax years 2010-2011, which were alleged, and 
2012, 2013 and 2015, which were not).  
 
 
9 
 
 
Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in July 2017, and is 
to begin paying $328 a month in late August 2017. He referenced, but did not document, 
an earlier installment agreement, begun in September 2016. He provided no documentary 
evidence of any payments made towards his significant past-due tax debt. He provided 
no documents to show when he filed his past due returns.  
 
Under AG ¶ 20(g), Applicant has an arrangement in place with the IRS, but did not 
provide sufficient evidence to show that he is in compliance with those arrangements, as 
required. Under AG ¶ 20(d), the steps he took to begin resolving his significant past-due 
federal tax debt are insufficient to establish that he “initiated and is adhering to a good-
faith effort to repay” it. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
       
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination 
on the written record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility 
based on demeanor.17  
 
 Applicant is a 50-year-old Air Force veteran and long-time defense contractor. He 
experienced significant financial difficulties after retiring from the Air Force in 2009 and 
divorcing a year later. Most troubling is the fact that he failed to timely file his federal 
income tax returns for several years, from 2012 to at least 2014. He only recently began 
to address his significant tax issues. Applicant made recent efforts to resolve his debts, 
but he does not have a reliable financial track record at this time. His finances and taxes 
                                                          
17 ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul 23, 2003).

remain a security concern. He has failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record 
evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability 
for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for 
access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
