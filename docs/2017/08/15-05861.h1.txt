Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient evidence of resolution of her financial issues, and 
financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On October 21, 2014, Applicant completed and signed her Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 25, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
2 
                                         
 
On April 29, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On June 23, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 30, 2016, the case was assigned to 
an administrative judge, and on April 24, 2017, the case was reassigned to me. On April 
24, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, 
setting the hearing for May 4, 2017. (HE 1) Applicant waived her right to 15 days of notice 
of the date, time, and location of her hearing. (Tr. 10-11) Applicant’s hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant presented 
seven exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 14-18; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-F) On May 15, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. On July 20, 2017, Applicant provided one 
exhibit, which was admitted without objection. (AE G) 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which he made applicable to 
all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 
2006 AGs and are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. 
Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new 
AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.r. She provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 34 years old, and she has been employed as a computer programmer 
for DOD contractors since 2014. (Tr. 5, 8, 18-19; GE 1) In 2001, she graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 7) In 2012, she received a bachelor’s degree in computer networking. (Tr. 8) 
She served in the Navy from 2005 to 2008; she held a security clearance while she was 
in the Navy; when she left active service, she was a petty officer third class; and she 
received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7, 22) In 2007, Applicant married, and she has an 
eight-year-old child. (Tr. 6) There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to her irresponsibility, immaturity, her  
unemployment, and her spouse’s injury. (Tr. 22-26, 41) Applicant was unemployed from 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.  
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
October 2016 to January 2017. (Tr. 20; AE A) She earned $70,000 annually at her 
previous employment with a DOD contractor. (Tr. 21) Her current annual salary is 
$93,000. (Tr. 20) In November 2015, her husband was seriously injured at work. (Tr. 22-
23; AE E) He received worker’s compensation until October 2016. (Tr. 23) His 
compensation ended because he had reached his point of maximum improvement. (Tr. 
23) Applicant’s husband is suing his employer for wrongful termination and for negligence. 
(Tr. 24-25) They expect to receive a settlement of about $100,000 for each of the lawsuits 
by the end of the summer of 2017, and she plans to use the funds to resolve her debts. 
(Tr. 25, 48) The receipt of the SOR was a shock, and she began taking her finances more 
seriously. (Tr. 26) Applicant’s SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling $57,532, and their 
status is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a utility debt for $1,234. Applicant said she paid this debt “little 
by little” over the years; however, she did not have documentation showing resolution. 
(Tr. 28-29) She said it was not on her current credit report. (Tr. 29)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d allege two telecommunications debts owed to the same 
company for $228 and $208. Applicant said she paid it about two months before her 
hearing. (Tr. 30) She said she had documentation showing payment at home, and she 
would provide it. (Tr. 30-31) The $228 debt is shown as paid on her May 2, 2017 credit 
report. (Tr. 49; GE 4) It is reasonable that these debts are duplications of each other, and 
she is credited with mitigating SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an after care school debt for $253. Applicant said she paid this 
debt in 2016; however, she did not have documentation showing payment. (Tr. 31) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.r allege the same Internet debt for $76. Applicant intended to 
pay this debt. (Tr. 33, 38; GE 4) She is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r as 
a duplication. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges an apartment debt for $4,402. Applicant said she is paying the 
creditor $50 monthly with the first payment being made in April 2017. (Tr. 33-34) She said 
she did not have any documentation showing payment. (Tr. 34) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.n allege eight federal student loans past due in the following 
amounts or in collections:  $8,836 for $346; $1,266 for $49; $8,050 for $315; $8,229 for 
$322; $5,991 for $127; $1,118 for $35; $5,032 for $131; and $5,162 for $167. In 2014, 
Applicant was in a student loan rehabilitation program; however, when her husband lost 
his employment, she stopped paying this debt. (Tr. 35-36) On April 27, 2017, the creditor 
for her eight U.S. Government guaranteed student loan accounts indicated: her principal 
balance is $49,017; her fees and costs are $11,838; her interest is $4,719; and her current 
balance owed on the eight accounts is $60,476. (AE C) The creditor wrote the monthly 
payment to rehabilitate her student loan debt is $216. (AE C) She said she is currently 
paying $216 monthly, and her first payment was made in April 2016. (Tr. 35)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p allege two student loans in collections from a bank for $4,147 
and $3,121. Applicant intends to get the two debts consolidated. (Tr. 36) She plans to 
 
4 
                                         
 
start paying $50 monthly in May 2017. (Tr. 36, 49) Her $1,651 federal income tax refund 
was used to pay these two student loans, and she currently owes about $7,000 on them. 
(Tr. 37; AE D)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.q alleges a book club debt for $103. Applicant did not recognize this debt; 
she disputed it; and it was removed from her credit report. (Tr. 37-38; GE 4) She is 
credited with mitigating this debt. 
 
Applicant received financial counseling. (Tr. 27) She provided a budget. (Tr. 32; 
AE F) When she received the raise to $93,000, she used some of the money to bring her 
rent and other bills to current status. (Tr. 27) In November 2016, her vehicle was 
voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 45) She does not use any credit cards. (Tr. 47) She said she 
paid a telecommunications non-SOR creditor $200, and she scheduled payment of the 
remainder of that debt for May 15, 2017. (Tr. 28) 
 
In sum, for the first four months of 2017, Applicant may have paid about $500 total 
over those four months to the SOR creditors. (Tr. 49-53) After her hearing, she provided 
a communication from a collection agent indicating a debt was paid; however, she did not 
show that it was connected to any SOR creditor. (AE G) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s landlord indicates she is an excellent tenant. (AE B) She timely pays 
her rent and is a good neighbor. (AE B)      
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
 
5 
                                         
 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
  
 
6 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions. 
 
Six financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;4   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for 
proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
                                            
 
4 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
 Applicant provided some mitigating information. She and her husband’s 
unemployment and his injury were circumstances beyond her control that harmed her 
finances. She received financial counseling, and she generated a budget. When she 
received the raise to $93,000, she used some of the money to bring her rent and other 
bills to current status. She is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.q, 
and 1.r.  
 
The evidence against mitigating financial considerations security concerns is more 
substantial. Applicant did not provide enough details with documentary corroboration 
about what she did to address her SOR debts. She made some uncorroborated claims of 
payments and payment plans. She was given ample time and guidance that 
documentation was necessary to support her claims of payment. She did not provide 
documentation relating to any of the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e through 1.p such 
as: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, 
or a letter from the creditor proving that she paid or made any payments to the creditors; 
(2) correspondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact; (3) 
copies of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies 
indicating she did not believe she was responsible for the debts and why she held such 
a belief; (4) evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement offers 
or agreements to show that she was attempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other 
evidence of progress or resolution.   
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
documented progress resolving her SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance that her 
financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. 
Under all the circumstances, she failed to establish that financial considerations security 
concerns are mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
 
9 
                                         
 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 34 years old, and she has been employed as a computer programmer 
for DOD contractors since 2014. In 2012, she received a bachelor’s degree in computer 
networking. She served in the Navy from 2005 to 2008; she held a security clearance 
while she was in the Navy; when she left active service, she was a petty officer third class; 
and she received an honorable discharge. In 2007, Applicant married, and she has an 
eight-year-old child. She and her husband’s unemployment and his injury are 
circumstances beyond her control that harmed her finances. She received financial 
counseling, and she generated a budget. She brought her rent and other bills to current 
status. There is no evidence of security violations.  
 
 Applicant admitted responsibility for 18 SOR delinquent debts totaling $57,532. 
She is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($228), 1.d ($208), 1.q ($103), 
and 1.r. ($76). The total delinquent debt is about $56,000. She did not make any 
documented progress addressing her other SOR debts. Her failure to act more 
aggressively to establish her financial responsibility indicates “poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations” and this conduct “raise[s] 
questions about [her] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information.” See AG ¶ 18. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an Appellant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). 
Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude that granting a 
security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform 
necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior 
consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence 
of her security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e through 1.p:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.q and 1.r:   For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
