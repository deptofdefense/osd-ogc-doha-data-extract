APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. 
On April 16, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On July 13, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant’s request for a
trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s brief does not raise an issue of harmful error by the Judge.  Rather, it consists
of information about events that have occurred since the close of the record.  We cannot consider
new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  We do not review a case de novo.  Our jurisdiction
is limited to cases in which the appealing party contends that the Judge committed harmful error. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01734 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Jan 19, 2017).  Accordingly, the Decision is
AFFIRMED.
