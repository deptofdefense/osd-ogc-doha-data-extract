MOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 3, 2016, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 
5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DoD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F.1 (Item 1.) The SOR 
further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD 
adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. 
 
 On June 18, 2016, Applicant submitted a written reply to the SOR with six 
attachments (RSOR A-F), and she requested that her case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 3.)  On July 19, 2017, Department Counsel issued the 
Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
                                                          
1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new 
Adjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was 
considered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006.

provided to Applicant. In the FORM, Department Counsel offered six documentary 
exhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit 
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on August 25, 
2016. Applicant submitted no additional documents. The case was assigned to this 
Administrative Judge on June 5, 2017. Based upon a review of the pleadings and 
exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and exhibits, I make the 
following findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 38 years old. She was born in Saigon, Vietnam. She became a 
naturalized United States citizen in 1983. Applicant is married. She is employed by a 
defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her 
employment in the defense sector. (Item 3.) 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
 
 The SOR lists nine allegations (1.a. through 1.i.) regarding financial difficulties, 
specifically overdue debts, under Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the SOR allegations 
will be discussed below in the order they were listed on the SOR: 
 
 1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgment filed against her in 
February 2013, in the amount of $27,245. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, but 
she wrote that the debt had been paid, and that the final payment was posted on 
February 9, 2015. She also wrote that she has made multiple attempts to have the 
creditor update her credit reports, and she has filed disputes with the credit reporting 
agencies. RSOR A establishes that this debt has been resolved.  
 
1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the 
amount of $1,282. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is 
currently enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that she is 
currently working with the program to have her debt negotiation accelerated. (Item 2.) 
While Applicant wrote on the update from FDR that she has settled this debt, the printed 
material from FDR states 0 payments have been made. (RSOR E.) No independent 
evidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or reduced. 
 
RSOR B includes a letter from Freedom Debt Relief (FDR), the debt settlement 
program referred to by Applicant in her RSOR, which states that Applicant enrolled in 
their program in June 15, 2015, which is scheduled to continue for 36 months. Applicant 
is scheduled to make monthly payments of $540, and she had 11 accounts enrolled in 
the program. RSOR C confirms that Applicant has made 25 payment of $270 to FDR.  
   
 1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the 
amount of $11,506. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is 
currently enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that the 
 
3 
 
account has been negotiated, and she is currently making timely payments according to 
the agreed upon terms. (Item 2.) The update from FDR states 5 of 18 payments of $200 
have been made toward this debt, and the debt has been reduced to $6,769. (RSOR E.)  
   
1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the 
amount of $1,291.  Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is 
currently enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that she is 
currently working with the program to have her debt negotiation accelerated. (Item 2.) 
The update from FDR states 0 payments have been made toward this debt. (RSOR E.) 
No independent evidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been 
resolved or reduced.          
  
1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the 
amount of $965. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is 
currently enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that she is 
currently working with the program to have her debt negotiation accelerated. (Item 2.) 
The update from FDR states 0 payments have been made toward this debt. (RSOR E.) 
No independent evidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been 
resolved or reduced. 
 
1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the amount 
of $4,783.  Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is 
currently enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that she is 
currently working with the program to have her debt negotiation accelerated. (Item 2.)  
The update from FDR states 0 payments have been made toward this debt. (RSOR E.) 
No independent evidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been 
resolved or reduced. 
  
 1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount 
of $1,222. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that she is currently 
enrolled in a debt settlement program through “FDR.” She added that she is currently 
working with the program to have her debt negotiation accelerated. (Item 2.) No 
evidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been resolved or reduced. 
 
1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the 
amount of $1,488. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that this 
debt was settled on May 19, 2016, according to the terms agreed to with the creditor. 
She is currently filing disputes through credit reporting agencies to have her status 
updated. (Item 2.) RSOR F shows that this debt was paid.  
  
 1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a charged-off account in the amount 
of $5,181. Applicant admitted this debt in her RSOR, and she wrote that this debt was 
settled on December 23, 2015, according to the terms agreed to with the creditor. She 
is currently filing disputes through credit reporting agencies to have her status updated. 
(Item 2.) RSOR D establishes that this debt has been resolved.

The evidence has established that Applicant currently owes more than $16,000 
in delinquent debts. Applicant did not submit a Personal Financial Statement or provide 
any other information or evidence about her current financial status. She also has failed 
to submit any other documents in mitigation.  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall 
be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
 
5 
 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
  Applicant had many delinquent debts for several years. While some of her debts 
have been reduced or resolved, she still has significant delinquent debt, and there has 
been no evidence introduced to establish that Applicant will be able to be more 
responsible in resolving her debts in the future.  
 
  The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The evidence is sufficient to raise disqualifying conditions (a) and (c) as 
potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing 
deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators; 
 
6 
 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required; 
 
(g) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, 
increase in net worth, or money transfers that are inconsistent with known 
legal sources of income; 
 
(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to 
fund gambling or pay gambling debts; and 
 
(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused 
by gambling.  
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered 
all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 including: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
7 
 
 
 Applicant has begun resolving her delinquent debts. However, there is still 
significant overdue debt, and no evidence has been introduced to establish that 
Applicant is current with all her recent debt, or will be able to live within her means in the 
future do not find that mitigation under AG ¶ 20 has been established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
 
8 
 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
