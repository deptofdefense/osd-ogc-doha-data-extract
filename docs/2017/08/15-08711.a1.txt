APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
9, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On May 31, 2017, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance. 
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He testified that his current
Federal tax debt is about $98,000.  His financial problems arose due to two business failures.  The
first business failed in approximately 2006.  The second business operated from about 2009 to 2014,
when his business partner passed away and the business lost a major contract to a competitor.  In
2014, he retained a tax attorney to handle his tax issues.  In late 2016, the attorney submitted a letter
stating he is working toward establishing a payment plan with the IRS to resolve the tax debt for
2008-2015 and the matter would be resolved in January 2017.  In February 2017, the attorney 
provided a follow-up letter advising an agreement was reached for Applicant to pay about $1,200 
monthly for 84 months, beginning in March 2017.  No documentation was submitted of the
agreement or of any payments.    
Applicant currently owes about $98,000 on student loans that he claims are in forbearance
and not delinquent.  He admitted the loans were delinquent from time to time starting in 2006.  He
documented that he started to resolve the student loans through a repayment plan and has made four
or five payments of about $300.
Applicant refuted an SOR allegation that he did not timely file his 2013 Federal income
taxes.  He also resolved some of the alleged delinquent debts.  He and his wife have a combined
gross income of about $120,000.  He provided budgets for a two-month period showing he had about
$100 of discretionary income each month.   He has taken a financial course.  He presented character
statements that reflect he has a reputation for being honest, loyal, trustworthy, and hard working. 
The Judge’s Analysis
Applicant’s tax debts are recent, have been unresolved since at least 2008,  and cast doubt
on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  While he provided correspondence from an
attorney concerning a repayment plan, he did not provide proof of the plan or of any payments.  He
only recently started making continuous payments on his student loans.  It is too soon to conclude
that his student loans are being resolved or are under control.  He has not established a meaningful
track record of financial responsibility in paying his student loans or Federal tax debt.
The failure of Applicant’s businesses and the death of his partner were events beyond his
control.  Although his tax problems date back to 2008, he failed to obtain professional tax assistance
until 2014 and an agreement with the IRS was not reached until February 2017.  These delays were
not responsible conduct. 
Discussion
Applicant contends the Judge noted that he and his wife have a combined annual income of 
$120,000, but the Judge did not indicate that was not their income for the entire period in question. 
We find no error in the Judge’s finding about Applicant’s annual income.  From our reading of the
decision, it was apparent the $120,000 was Applicant’s recent income because the Judge had already
discussed Applicant’s business failures in 2006 and 2014.     
Applicant argues the Judge did not consider important aspects of the case.  For example, he
cites to circumstances outside his control such as the economic volatility of the past 14 years and
that he is a person of high moral character.  His arguments, however, are not sufficient to rebut the
presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-
04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  Moreover, the presence of some mitigating evidence does
not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence
outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party’s disagreement with the Judge’s
weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01652 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.
7, 2017). 
The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may
be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department
of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of
the national security.”
