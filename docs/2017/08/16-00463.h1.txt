Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for 
access to classified information. She did not present sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from her failure to timely file state 
and federal individual income tax returns for tax years 2011-2014. Accordingly, this 
case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on September 9, 2015. This document is commonly known as 
a security clearance application. Thereafter, on June 9, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.

Applicant answered the SOR on July 5, 2016; she admitted failure to timely file 
state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2010-2014, but she stated she had no 
knowledge of a past-due balance of $11,186 for a second mortgage loan; and she 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The hearing took place as 
scheduled on December 8, 2016. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received December 
16, 2016. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters; she 
made a timely submission per e-mail on January 6, 2017; and those matters are 
admitted without objections as Exhibits G through O.     
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance.1 Her educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in business 
administration. She is employed as a buyer in a purchasing department of a federal 
contractor doing business in the defense industry. She has been so employed from 
November 2008 to present. Her total income for 2015 was about $91,000.2 
 
In her September 2015 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that 
she failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 
2013.3 She estimated owing $0 in back taxes because she had paid income taxes via 
payroll withholding. She also disclosed two delinquent credit card accounts that she had 
closed and then paid off with $1,000 monthly payments.  
 
Applicant provided additional information about these matters during her October 
2015 background investigation.4 She stated that her paperwork became disorganized 
due to a cross-town move in June 2009, which resulted in her failure to file tax returns 
for tax year 2010, and then the situation snowballed over the next several years. She 
also stated that she had since hired an accountant and was gathering up the necessary 
documentation to provide to the accountant. She further explained that her financial 
issues were the result of a downturn in the real estate business, which was her primary 
occupation until February 2007 and part-time job until November 2008, when she began 
her current employment.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b: failure to file state and federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2010-2014, as required. These matters are discussed together because they are 
factually interrelated. At the hearing, Applicant explained that she contacted an 
accountant in late 2014 or early 2015, but lacked sufficient funds to pay a retainer fee.5 
She then made installment payments to the accountant until the retainer was paid. The

accountant was unable to complete the work during the summer of 2016, but did so in 
the fall. Applicant presented reliable documentation showing that she is now in 
compliance with state and federal tax authorities; her state and federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2011-2015 were prepared and submitted for processing on 
October 15, 2016; and she has paid all back taxes.6  
 
For the state taxes, Applicant owed a total of $4,773 for tax years 2011, 2012, 
and 2013, while minor refunds for 2014 and 2015 were applied to the 2011 amount due. 
She resolved the state taxes with a payment of $4,977 on December 7, 2016.7 
 
For the federal taxes, Applicant owed $11,799 for tax year 2011, which she paid 
on December 21, 2016.8 She owed $5,256 for tax year 2012, which she paid in early 
January 2017.9 She was due a refund of $1,941 for tax year 2013.10 She was due a 
refund of $4,511 for tax year 2014, which was applied to an amount owed for 2011, 
reducing the balance to $11,799.11 And she was due a refund of $5,187 for tax year 
2015.12 
 
Applicant explained that she had sufficient funds to pay the state and federal 
back taxes because she obtained a $46,000 loan from her 401(k) account.13 She used 
the remaining funds to pay off the balances on the bulk of her credit card accounts and 
is finalizing a plan to pay off the remainder.14 She also participated in a cash-in of paid-
time-off hours through her employer whereby she traded 40 hours of time-off for 36 
hours of pay, less taxes and deductions, to assist in her overall debt reduction. 
Applicant owns her home, which has a market value of about $325,000. She moved into 
the house in June 2009, and she received the house as an inheritance after her mother 
passed away in 2010.  
 
                                                          
6 Exhibits B, C, D, and G-O. There is no paperwork for tax year 2010. As I understand IRS practice and 
procedure, the IRS requires a taxpayer to go back and file returns for the last six years to get in their good 
graces, and then make arrangements to pay what is owed. The six-year period for past-due returns is 
found in IRS Policy Statement 5-133 and Internal Revenue Manual 1.2.14.1.18. Given that Applicant had 
the assistance of a tax professional in preparing the tax returns, I’ll presume that there is no issue for tax 
year 2010.

SOR ¶1.c: past-due balance of $11,186 on a second mortgage with a total loan 
balance of about $78,426. Applicant explained that this loan stems from a home that 
was foreclosed upon in about mid-2010 after being in a short-sale status for several 
months.15 The primary mortgage loan was redeemed by foreclosure.16 After the 
foreclosure, she did not receive notice of a balance due from the mortgage lender. She 
learned about the past-due account during the security-clearance process. She has 
called the mortgage lender several times and was told the account has a zero balance. 
She was unsuccessful in her effort to obtain written verification of a zero balance from 
the mortgage lender.17 The past-due second mortgage loan appears in an October 
2015 credit report, but the account does not appear in more recent credit reports from 
November 2016.18 In addition, Applicant resides in a non-recourse state that has two 
anti-deficiency statutes that preclude deficiency judgments: one for mortgages and one 
for deeds of trust.19 
 
In addition to the above matters, Applicant described a series of circumstances 
or life events that contributed to her delay in addressing the past-due tax returns.20 
Those matters include the downturn in the real estate market during 2007-2008 that 
reduced her income and contributed to the foreclosure; her part-time employment so 
she could provide care to her mother who lived in another state; and a difficult teenage 
daughter with a serious alcohol problem that led to treatment via an inpatient 
rehabilitation program beginning in November 2011. At the time, Applicant described 
herself as consumed with self-doubt, but continued working to make ends meet, which 
included both legal (drunk driving) and medical bills for her daughter. As a result, 
Applicant did not take care of herself, which included the tax returns, as she then felt 
overwhelmed. She now feels embarrassed and ashamed about her circumstances, but 
believes her past emotional paralysis is not an indicator of her current competencies.21 
 
A longtime friend and co-worker provided highly favorable testimony for 
Applicant. The witness described Applicant as very reliable, highly ethical, and painfully 
honest. Given her high opinion of Applicant, the witness asked Applicant to be her 
matron of honor at her wedding. The witness also recommended Applicant for her 
current job.

Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.22 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.23 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”24 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.25 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.26 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.27 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.28 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.29 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.30

 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.31 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.32 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .33 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.

 The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic 
financial history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. With that said, 
the past-due balance for the second mortgage loan is now old business, as it is related 
to a foreclosure that occurred in 2010. Moreover, Applicant was unaware of any past-
due balance until a credit report was obtained during the course of her 2015 
background investigation. The mortgage lender, which does business in a non-recourse 
state, has informed her that the account has a zero balance. And the past-due account 
does not appear on the most recent credit reports from 2016. Given these 
circumstances, I have no concern about this particular matter.  
 
 Nevertheless, Applicant’s tax problem with both state and federal tax authorities 
is a serious matter. Not only did Applicant fail to timely file tax returns for multiple tax 
years, she also owed back taxes for multiple tax years. Her tax problem bears close 
examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal government.34 It suggests 
that she has a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and 
systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting 
classified or sensitive information. An applicant who has a history of not fulfilling their 
tax obligations may be said not to have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and 
reliability required for access to classified or sensitive information. 
 
 I considered Applicant’s evidence of mitigation, reform, and rehabilitation. First, I 
considered the series of circumstances or life events noted above. Obviously, the 
circumstances were largely beyond her control. I have empathy for any person who 
goes through such difficult circumstances, and I can see how the circumstances 
contributed to Applicant’s delay in addressing her tax problem. Still, many people go 
through similar or more difficult circumstances and at the same time continue to meet 
their tax obligations. Second, she deserves credit for taking action to hire a tax 
professional to prepare and file the tax returns. Likewise, she deserves credit for 
obtaining a loan from her 401(k) account to pay the back taxes. As of January 2017, it 
appears Applicant is in compliance with her state and federal income tax obligations 
through the most recent tax year of 2015.  
 
 I also considered both the timing and length of compliance, which are issues of 
fact I am allowed to weigh. Concerning the timing, I note that Applicant filed the tax 
returns in mid-October 2016 and she paid the back taxes in December 2016 and 
January 2017. Those events were in close proximity to the scheduled hearing in this 
case after years of neglect. Concerning the length of compliance, I note that Applicant 
has been in compliance with state and federal tax authorities for less than one year after 
years of noncompliance. Those circumstances, along with her age, experience, and 
maturity at the time of the conduct, militate against a favorable decision.  
 
 On balance, Applicant’s favorable evidence is outweighed by the nature, extent, 
and seriousness of her tax problem. Her tax problem does not amount to a per se rule 
                                                          
34 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

against a favorable clearance decision. But considering the totality of facts and 
circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that Applicant is an acceptable national 
security risk.   
 
 Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts or concerns 
about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect 
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice 
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she did 
not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
