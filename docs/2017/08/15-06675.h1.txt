TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 11, 2015, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF-86). On May 18, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, 
under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.  
 
On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence issued Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). These AGs 
apply to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. Any changes

resulting from the issuance of new Adjudicative Guidelines did not affect my decision in 
this case. 
 
 The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR detailed 
reasons why DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and referred his case to 
an administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted or 
denied. 
 
On June 23, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated August 19, 2016, was provided to him by letter dated August 
22, 2016. Applicant received the FORM on September 19, 2016. He was afforded a 
period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant did not submit any additional information within the 30-day period. 
On July 7, 2017, the case was assigned to me. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.  His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Background Information1 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor 
since March 2015. He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his current 
employment.    
 
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1991. He was awarded a 
bachelor’s degree in January 1998. Applicant married in August 2003, and has two 
minor children. He did not serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists six allegations, consisting of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed 
and dismissed in 2012, and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy also filed and dismissed in 2012. 
Also listed are four debts: (1) a charged-off credit card account for $30,256; (2) a 
charged-off credit card account for $4,699, (3) a charged-off home equity account for 
$39,712, and (4) a charged-off credit card account for $20,367. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – l.f; Item 
1) These allegations are established through Applicant’s admissions; his March 11, 
2015 SF-86; his March 31, 2015 and August 18, 2016 credit reports; his April 22, 2015 
Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); and his 
                                                          
1 The limited background information regarding Applicant was derived from the FORM and was the most 
current information available.

Chapter 13 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy summaries accessed on August 17, 2016. (Items 
1 – 7) 
 
 Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to three periods of unemployment: (1) 
April 2010 to March 2011; (2) March 2013 to November 2013; and (3) March 2014 to 
March 2015. In March 2015, he began his current job.  (Items 2, 3) 
 
 As a result of these periods of unemployment, Applicant was unable to make the 
house payments on his two homes. He immediately contacted his lenders seeking to 
refinance, but his overtures were rejected. With his lenders threatening foreclosure, he 
filed Chapter 13 and 7 bankruptcies in 2012 to delay foreclosure while he tried to sell his 
homes. Applicant was able to sell both homes by short sale and the bankruptcies were 
dismissed. (Items 1, 2, 3) Additionally, all of Applicant’s credit card debt was incurred to 
make mortgage payments on the homes he eventually lost. (Items 1, 3) 
 
 In his SOR answer, Applicant submitted copies of Form 1099-C cancelling the 
debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, a Form 1099-A disclosing the status of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.e, and a Form 1099-C cancelling the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. In short, all four of the 
creditors or lenders listed in the SOR cancelled or are not pursuing Applicant’s debts 
and issued Forms 1099-C or 1099-A. In Applicant’s April 22, 2015 OPM PSI, he 
reported that he included the cancellation of debts when he filed his Federal income 
taxes. (Items 1, 2, 3) 
 
 During that same OPM PSI, Applicant stated that he is trying hard to recover 
from the financial fallout following his periods of unemployment. He is living on a tight 
budget and is building up his savings. His wife is also working full-time which has 
helped with the household expenses. Applicant stated that he has a good, steady job 
that will allow him to maintain financial stability. (Item 3) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
  
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
  
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
  
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(b) 
unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;” and “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations.” Based on the information in the SOR, the record 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
  
AG ¶ 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.

The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because 
there is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. 
Therefore, his debt is “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG ¶ 
20(a) because the debt “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.”  Under AG ¶ 20(b), he receives full credit because his three lengthy periods 
of unemployment and downfall in the economy were largely beyond his control. When 
faced with income shortfalls, Applicant acted responsibly by attempting to work with his 
lenders and when that failed, he filed Chapters 13 and 7 bankruptcies to delay 
foreclosure. This strategy gave him additional time to sell his homes, which he did by 
short sale.2  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and (d) are partially applicable. Although there is no evidence in the 
record that Applicant sought formal financial counseling, it is clear that his financial 
situation is under control and his SOR debts have been resolved. It should be noted that 
Applicant gained no benefit from his bankruptcy filings other than acquiring additional 
time to sell his homes, thereby mitigating his losses. The remaining mitigating 
conditions are not applicable.  
 
Applicant’s financial situation is on the mend, but it will take additional time and 
steady employment for him regain his former financial status. The steps Applicant has 
taken support the notion that he takes his financial responsibility seriously and that this 
                                                          
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his 
debts current.

process has had a sobering effect on him. In addition to evaluating the facts and 
applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the 
record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG ¶ 2(d).  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.f:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.
