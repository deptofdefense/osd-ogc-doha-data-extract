Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for 
access to classified information. She presented sufficient evidence to explain and 
mitigate the security concern stemming from her use of marijuana. Accordingly, this 
case is decided for Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on September 16, 2015. This document is commonly known as 
a security clearance application. Thereafter, on June 17, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified 
information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
 
2 
 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline H for drug involvement. She 
answered the SOR with a one-page memorandum on July 15, 2016, and she requested 
a hearing.  
 
The case was assigned to me August 23, 2016. The hearing was held as 
scheduled on November 8, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1-3; Exhibits 1 
and 3 were admitted; and Exhibit 2 was not admitted due to lack of authentication. 
Applicant testified on her own behalf and offered Exhibit A, which was admitted. The 
transcript of hearing (Tr.) was received November 15, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 40-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for her job 
as a finance manager with a company doing business in the defense industry. She has 
worked for this company since December 2007. She passed a pre-employment drug 
test when she began working for the company.2 This is the first time she has applied for 
a security clearance because her previous work-related duties did not require it. She 
has a good record of employment.3 Her educational background includes a bachelor’s 
degree with an emphasis in accounting.4  
 
 Applicant has married and divorced three times. The first time, she married 
young at age 19, and the divorce occurred about a year later. She married for the 
second time in 2002, had a child in 2003, separated in 2006, and divorced in 2007. 
Because they had a child together, she agreed to remarry her second husband, but the 
marriage ended in divorce in 2016. The minor child, now a teenager, continues to live 
with her. 
 
 As alleged in the SOR, this case concerns Applicant’s illegal drug involvement 
consisting of use of marijuana. She disclosed using marijuana from about August 1992 
to August 2015 in her security clearance application.5 She stated that she used 
marijuana about once a month for migraine headaches and for upset stomach and 
during certain social events. She also stated that she believed that occasional use of 
marijuana was no worse than occasional consumption of alcohol and is safer than using 
tobacco products.   
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in 
the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

At the hearing, Applicant admitted using marijuana on a periodic basis from 
about the age of 16 (1993) to about August 2015. She explained that her use of 
marijuana fell roughly into the following periods: (1) during 1993-1996 when she used 
every couple of months with her teenage friends; (2) during 1998-2006 when she was 
dating and then married and living with her second husband, using it on average about 
once a month to treat her migraine headaches; and (3) from 2012 to 2015 when she 
reunited with her second husband, using it on average about once a month to treat her 
headaches.6  
 
Applicant stopped using marijuana immediately in about August 2015 when her 
company’s security officer reviewed her application and informed her it was a major 
issue.7 Her decision to stop using marijuana was prompted or motivated by the 
realization of the severe or serious impact it had on her ability to obtain a security 
clearance, her ability to progress in her career, and the fact that it called into question 
her integrity, honesty, and loyalty to her country.8 She also explained that she later 
informed her then husband that she was no longer comfortable with his lifestyle and told 
him to refrain from using marijuana at home.9 His habitual use of marijuana was one of 
the considerations or factors in the most recent divorce.10 
 
Applicant does not intend to use marijuana in the future. Although she still suffers 
from migraine headaches, she found other ways to obtain relief.11 She estimated the 
probability of her reuniting with her marijuana-using ex-husband as “less than zero.”12 
Likewise, she estimated the probability of her marrying or living with another man who 
uses marijuana as “less than zero.”13 Regarding her previous statement on her security 
clearance application, she explained the following: 
 
At the time when the question [on the security clearance application] was 
being asked, I didn’t understand that it was going to negatively impact the 
clearance, that it would have the weight, the significance. I was trying to 
just be as honest as I possibly could in the form and did not have the 
appreciation for the significance of the statement or the impact of the 
action.14

Applicant submitted Exhibit A, in which she agreed that she will not engage in 
any drug abuse or other illegal drug involvement, regardless of any state codes or laws 
permitting this behavior. She further agreed that any failure to comply as agreed will 
result in the automatic revocation of any security clearance held by her. 
 
 Applicant made a favorable impression on me during the hearing. She was 
sincere, respectful, and polite. Overall, I found her credible and worthy of belief. 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.15 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”16 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.17 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.18 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.19 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.20 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.21 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.22

clearance).

 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.23 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.24 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline H for drug involvement, the concern is that “use of an illegal 
drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about a [person’s] reliability 
and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises 
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and 
regulations.”25 In applying Guideline H to the facts of this case, I note that in an October 
24, 2014 memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed that the 
disregard of federal law concerning use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana is relevant in 
national security determinations regardless of changes in state laws concerning 
marijuana use. Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, 
which means it is a drug that has no currently accepted medical use and has a high 
potential for abuse.26   
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 25(a) any drug abuse; 
 
AG ¶ 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug 
paraphernalia; and  
 
AG ¶ 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, 
such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) 
changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; (3) an 
appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with 
automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.  
 
 I have considered the totality of Applicant’s periodic use of marijuana over more 
than a 20-year period. In my view, the most troubling aspect of this case is Applicant’s 
use of marijuana during 2012-2015 while employed by a defense contractor, which 
typically has a drug-free workplace policy. Plainly, that is not minor or trivial misconduct, 
and it needs to be weighed accordingly.

 Applicant presented a substantial case in reform and rehabilitation. Her initial 
period of marijuana use during 1993-1996 occurred during her teenage years and is 
discounted accordingly. Her subsequent periods of marijuana use during 1998-2006 
and 2012-2015 occurred when she was in a relationship with her marijuana-using ex-
husband. Marijuana was then readily available. She is no longer associating with her 
ex-husband, marijuana is no longer readily available in her home, and she has found 
other ways to treat her migraine headaches. She has not used marijuana since August 
2015, about 15 months before the record closed, which is a sufficient period of 
abstinence. Further, she has no intention of using marijuana in the future, and she 
submitted a signed statement of intent on that point. Taken together, the totality of facts 
and circumstances establish that Applicant has had a change of heart concerning 
marijuana use, and she will not use it again.   
 
 In addition, Applicant receives credit in mitigation because she voluntarily 
reported the information about her use of marijuana in her 2015 security clearance 
application, and she has been truthful and complete in responding to questions about 
her marijuana use.27 Her willingness to self-report her marijuana use is an important 
aspect of this case. Her willingness to self-report adverse information speaks highly for 
her integrity, her willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and her overall 
suitability for access to classified information.  
 
 Applicant’s history of marijuana use no longer creates doubt about her reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. Accordingly, I conclude 
that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline H:      For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:        For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
