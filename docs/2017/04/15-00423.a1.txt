APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
August 27, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E
(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)
(Directive).  Applicant  requested a hearing.  On January 23, 2017, after the hearing, Defense Office
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant’s request
for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s brief includes copies of documents that Applicant had submitted at the hearing
regarding the status of his debts.  These documents contain handwritten annotations by Applicant
that post-date the Judge’s decision.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶
E3.1.29.  In any event, they address the Guideline F allegations, which the Judge had resolved in
Applicant’s favor.  Applicant’s brief contains no assertion of harmful error concerning the Guideline
E allegation of deliberate falsification which the Judge resolved adversely to him.  Our scope of
review is limited to cases in which the appealing party has asserted that the Judge committed
harmful error.  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.  See ISCR Case No. 15-01778 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 2017). 
Applicant has not made such an assertion regarding the allegation of deliberate falsification. 
Therefore, the Judge’s decision is AFFIRMED.
