GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On December 7, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications 
and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed

reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 17, 2015. On January 5, 2016, he 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 22, 
2016. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
April 8, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 28, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, 6 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 6, and 16 Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE P were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 6, 2016. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely 
submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as Applicant exhibits 
(AE) Q through AE Z, without objection. The record closed on June 2, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a number of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b. and 1.f. through 1.j.). Applicant’s admissions 
and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
multifunctional manufacturing supervisor or project engineer with the company since 
August 2001. He is a 1996 high school graduate. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2004 
and a master’s degree in 2013. He has never served in the U.S. military. He was granted 
a secret security clearance in 2002, but it was administratively suspended in 2012 
following a prolonged absence due to surgery. He currently has an interim secret 
clearance. Applicant was married in January 2003. He has a son and three daughters 
with his wife, born in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, as well as a daughter, born in 1998, 
from another relationship.  
 
Financial Considerations2 
Applicant’s initial financial difficulties arose at some point during the period 2004 
to 2008. During an interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) in February 2015, Applicant described various financial 
issues arising in 2008 and 2009, but during his hearing, the focus changed to the period 
                                                          
2 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following 
exhibits: GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 11, 2014); GE 3 (Equifax 
Credit Report, dated March 15, 2016); GE 1, supra note 1; GE 4 (Personal Subject Interview, dated February 25, 2015); 
and Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated January 5, 2016. More recent information can be found in the exhibits 
furnished and individually identified.

2004 through 2006, and again in June 2007. In 2006, he had extensive repairs and 
remodeling done on his residence. Things were purportedly fine financially for about two 
years, but then a combination of events started taking their toll on his finances. In June 
2007, he purchased a new residence with a larger mortgage. While the exact timeline is 
rather murky given Applicant’s inability to be more precise with his facts, it appears that: 
(1) his wife took unpaid maternity leave on at least one occasion; (2) two of his children 
were born; and (3) his wife went through two lengthy involuntary periods of layoffs (March 
2004 until March 2006, and September 2007 until August 2008); (4) in 2012, Applicant 
underwent gastric bypass surgery; (5) not all of the medical expenses were covered by 
his insurance; and (6) he was unable to work for a lengthy period.3 The increased 
expenses placed too big a burden on his finances, and he was unable to maintain his 
accounts in a current status. Accounts were placed for collection, and some of them went 
to judgment. Applicant evaluated his financial situation, and he decided to prioritize his 
debts by focusing on the larger ones or the ones involved in garnishments. Because he 
had insufficient funds to make even minimum payments, he made a conscious decision 
to accept wage garnishments to use as a mechanism to satisfy his debts.4 
The SOR identified ten purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or filed as judgments, as reflected by his 2014 credit report or his 2016 credit 
report. Those debts, totaling approximately $44,692, and their respective current status, 
according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This refers to a bank credit card account with a $4,000 credit limit 
that was past due $4,667 when it was sold to a debt purchaser in 2012. In 2013, the debt 
purchaser obtained a $4,781 judgment against Applicant.5 Following the judgment, 
Applicant’s salary was involuntarily garnished, and in August 2015 – nearly four months 
before the SOR was issued – the judgment was satisfied with the final payment. Applicant 
had paid $5,022.52. A Satisfaction of Judgment was filed on September 1, 2015.6 The 
account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This refers to a medical account that was placed for collection and a 
$915 judgment was obtained against Applicant in 2013.7 Applicant acknowledged that he 
                                                          
3 GE 5, supra note 2, at 7-8; AE D (Wife’s Leave of Absence Record, undated); Tr. at 62-63. Applicant’s annual 
income was on an upward trajectory from  2005 until 2008 ($43,764, $45,184, $50,660, and $57,744), while his wife’s 
income during the same period was very erratic ($346, $30214, $19,434, and $21,131). See AE B (Form W-2 Wage 
and Tax Statements, various dates); AE C (Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statements, various dates); AE A (Combined 
Wages – 4 Year Average, undated).

has made no efforts to resolve the account, preferring to focus on other accounts.8 The 
account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.f.): These two allegations refer to snapshots of the same bank-
issued home improvement store charge account with a $3,500 credit limit and an unpaid 
balance of $5,062, of which $1,945 was past due and placed for collection. The account 
was sold to a debt purchaser.9 The debt purchaser obtained a judgment of $5,822.17 in 
September 2012, and instituted an income execution to garnish Applicant’s wages. 
Applicant’s wages were garnished, commencing in November 2013, and as of December 
2015 – the same month that the SOR was issued – $4,067.37 of Applicant’s wages had 
been garnished, leaving an unpaid balance of $2,990.25.10 The 2014 credit report 
erroneously reported that there had been no payments towards the judgment, but, in truth, 
$4,067.37 had already been paid. The account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This refers to an unspecified type of account that was placed for 
collection in 2012. The collection agent obtained a judgment of $6,793.25 in May 2012, 
and instituted an income execution to garnish Applicant’s wages. Applicant’s wages were 
garnished, commencing in December 2012, and as of April 2016, $7,312.59, including 
interest and fees, of Applicant’s wages had been garnished.11 Before the SOR was 
issued, the most recent payment on the judgment occurred on October 24, 2013.12 A final 
payment of $617.53 was made on May 11, 2016.13 The attorney representing the 
judgment-plaintiff indicated the judgment had been satisfied, and that a Satisfaction of 
Judgment would be submitted to the credit reporting agencies.14 The 2014 credit report 
erroneously reported that there had been no payments towards the judgment, but, in truth, 
$7,312.59 had already been paid. The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This refers to a bank second mortgage account with a high credit of 
$32,773 and unpaid and a past-due balance of $15,739.12 that was placed for collection 
in 2014.15 Applicant worked with the collection agent. In May 2014, Applicant paid the 
collection agent $400; in July 2014, after withdrawing funds from his 401(k) retirement 
account, he made another payment of $11,339.12; and in August 2014 – about 16 months

before the SOR was issued – he made a payment of $4,000, for a total of $15,739.12, 
resolving the delinquency.16 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This refers to an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid 
balance of $3,472 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser identified 
as a factoring company.17 In May 2016, the account was settled for $1,909.79, and 
Applicant made that payment to the debt purchaser which, according to the debt 
purchaser, resolved the account.18 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This refers to an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid 
balance of $2,147 that was placed for collection and sold to the same debt purchaser 
identified as a factoring company, identified above.19 Applicant acknowledged that he has 
made no efforts to resolve the account, preferring to focus on other accounts.20 The 
account has not been resolved. 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i. and 1.j.): These refer to two medical accounts with unpaid balances 
of $893 and $239 that were placed for collection.21 Applicant acknowledged that he has 
made no efforts to resolve the accounts, preferring to focus on other accounts.22 The 
accounts have not been resolved. 
 Applicant’s annual income since 2012 has continued on an upward trajectory: 
$76,541, $76,600, $79,240, and $81,137.23 His 2016 annual income was $87,288.24 
While his wife’s income during the same period continued to be erratic, it substantially 
improved over the previous period: $63,760, $48,171, $85,922, and $74,069.25 Because 
she is an hourly employee, her annual income for 2016 was more difficult to determine. 
Nevertheless, on May 2, 2016, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement that 
reported the combined family net monthly income as $9,972; with $6,445 (including a 
garnishment of $772 to the debt purchaser identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.f.) in monthly 
expenses; leaving a monthly remainder of $3,527 available for discretionary saving or

spending.26 He also reported separate 401(k) retirement accounts for his wife ($23,928) 
and himself ($26,975), as well as two pieces of real estate (their residence and a rental 
property).27 He has no other delinquent accounts. With the exception of meeting with a 
bankruptcy attorney about six years before the hearing, Applicant has never had financial 
counseling.28 After discussing the possible bankruptcy options, Applicant elected not to 
follow up with a bankruptcy because the estimated payment amount seemed intimidating. 
Instead, because he was unsure what to expect from any legal process, he simply allowed 
the garnishments to occur. In hindsight, now that he has experienced the garnishment 
process, he wishes he had taken a different approach.  
Applicant intends to reach out to his remaining creditors to pay them off. While he 
relied primarily on garnishments rather than his own affirmative actions, Applicant has 
made substantial progress in resolving his delinquent accounts. Given the relative modest 
amount remaining delinquent, and Applicant’s monthly remainder, it appears that 
Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly, and that his financial problems are 
finally under control.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s operations manager has known Applicant for approximately ten years 
in several different positions. He characterized Applicant as a person who completes 
tasks and is reliable, and he does his job with integrity.29 Applicant’s work performance 
ratings for 2015 and 2016 reflect an individual who has achieved or exceeded the variety 
of stated goals, and who has been proficient in stated behaviors, in the performance of 
his job.30 The president of the local little league noted that Applicant has been a volunteer 
coach for two years, requiring many hours of volunteer service per week. There is no 
reason to question Applicant’s integrity or honesty. Applicant has exceeded all 
expectations of Little League International. 31 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”32 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to

determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”33   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather

a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.

than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”36 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in 2004, and increased 
periodically during the ensuing years. Accounts became delinquent and some were 
placed for collection. Four judgments were filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person

has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”38 In addition, 
AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) apply, and AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(d) partially apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems are attributed to a variety of factors: (1) his wife took unpaid 
maternity leave on at least one occasion; (2) two of his children were born; (3) his wife 
went through two lengthy involuntary periods of layoffs; (4) in 2012, Applicant underwent 
gastric bypass surgery; (5) not all of the medical expenses of his surgery were covered 
by his insurance; and (6) he was unable to work for a lengthy period. Nearly all of those 
factors were largely beyond Applicant=s control.  
 
 As a seemingly financially naïve individual, Applicant embraced a rather 
unconventional course of conduct in resolving his debts. Unable to make what he 
considered to be minimum payments, and faced with streaming judgments on accounts 
he could not maintain in a current status, Applicant conceded to reality and avoided 
confrontation or legal fees by rejecting bankruptcy and accepting wage garnishments as 
the primary mechanism to satisfy his debts. One after the other, garnishments were filed, 
and eventually, judgments were resolved. As noted above, Applicant decided to prioritize 
his debts by focusing on the larger ones or the ones involved in garnishments. Of the ten 
SOR-related debts alleged (including one that was alleged twice), Applicant’s rather 
unconventional method of debt resolution has seen five accounts resolved, or in the 
process of being resolved, with only four rather modest debts remaining to be addressed. 
He has acknowledged an intention to do so. 
 
Applicant never received financial counseling other than potential bankruptcy 
counseling. There are no other delinquent debts. He and his wife have adjusted their 
lifestyle and, with her back in the workforce on a permanent basis, their combined family 
net monthly income is $9,972. After expenses, they have $3,527 available each month 
available for saving or spending. Those figures reflect that Applicant’s financial status has 
                                                          
38 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

improved significantly. With no other delinquent debts, except for the four unresolved 
ones listed in the SOR, Applicant’s financial problems are finally under control. He 
appears to have acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the 
circumstances confronting him, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.39 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.40       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain his normal monthly payments to a number of his accounts, and, over multi-year 
period, a number of accounts became delinquent, and they were placed for collection. 
Four judgments were filed against him. Applicant chose to see his debts resolved through 
garnishment rather than taking positive action to do so by himself. Given his monthly 
remainder, Applicant might have taken swifter action in commencing the resolution of his 
remaining debts. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems or mishandling 
protected information. Applicant’s financial problems were attributed to a variety of 
combined factors that were largely beyond Applicant=s control. Without the financial 
resources to maintain his accounts in a current status, they became delinquent. As early 
as 2012, years before the SOR was issued, largely due to Applicant’s unconventional

Jun. 2, 2006).

method of debt resolution, accounts started to be resolved. He has nearly completed his 
task as all but a few of the accounts have been resolved. Applicant followed through on 
his promises to address his debts.41  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 42 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a meaningful, though unconventional, track record of 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was 
issued. He keeps track of his expenses, maintains a budget, and has a substantial 
monthly remainder available for saving or spending. This decision should serve as a 
warning that Applicant’s failure to continue his resolution efforts with respect to his 
unresolved debts, or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect his 
future eligibility for a security clearance.43 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
                                                          
41 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
42 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
43 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. DOHA has no authority to attach limiting conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR 
Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See 
also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006);

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
