MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 31, 2009. 
On October 17, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on December 9, 2015, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 25, 
2016, and the case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on August 12, 2016. 
On January 12, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 2, 2017. On January 30, 2017, 
the case was transferred to me, and I convened the hearing as scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, 5 through 9, and 11 through 14 were 
admitted into evidence without objection. I admitted GE 4 and 10 over Applicant’s 
objection. I appended a letter that Government sent to Applicant as Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) I and Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, Applicant testified but did 
not submit any documents. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open to March 2, 
2017, and then I sua sponte kept the record open to March 24, 2017. I timely received 
documents that I admitted as AE A without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 
on February 13, 2017. 
 
SOR Amendment 
 
 At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel’s motion to amend the SOR to 
correct a typographical error in the section reference in SOR ¶ 1.k from 24 to 23, without 
objection from Applicant.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant, age 29, has been married for almost three years.3 He has one child 
born of this marriage, who is two years old.4 He received his G.E.D. in 2006. He served 
in the U.S. Army from 2006 through 2008, when he was involuntarily separated by a 
general discharge under honorable conditions.5 While in the military, he earned college 
credits as a lab technician and phlebotomist. Later, he earned multiple Information 
Technology (IT) certifications.6 He has been employed as an IT technician full time by 
federal contractors for over six years, including over four years with his current 
employer.7 Applicant has held a security clearance since 2006.8 
 
In his SOR answer, Applicant denied each of the 12 allegations. During his 
hearing, he amended his answer to the SOR to admit the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i,9 and affirmed his denial of the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 
and 1.j through 1.l.10

2 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from 
Applicant’s SOR answer, SCA (GE 1), and the summaries of his personal subject interviews (SI), which 
Applicant adopted as accurately reflecting the facts discussed during his December 11, 2009 and October 
21, 2009 interviews (GE 2 at 3-13 and 26).

Applicant assaulted individuals during fights that occurred in 2005 while he was 
in high school at age 17 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and in 2006 while he was in the military at age 18 
(SOR ¶ 1.b).11 At hearing, he acknowledged wrongdoing in both instances and 
attributed his actions to peer pressure and immaturity.12 Applicant denied committing an 
assault as charged in November 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.h), but did admit to engaging in a 
shouting match with a woman who believed he was threatening.13 Given the lack of 
evidence of any assault, the nature of the incident, and the fact that the associated 
criminal charges were nolle prossed,14 I find SOR ¶ 1.h in favor of Applicant. 
 
Applicant was convicted in 2008 of possession of a firearm while under the age 
of 21 relating to an incident that occurred in 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.c).15 I have considered his 
testimony denying actual possession or ownership of the firearm.16 I have also 
considered that he contradicted himself at hearing when he admitted ownership of the 
firearm and asserted his belief that he possessed it legally regardless of his age 
because of his military training.17  
 
In 2007, Applicant was charged criminally after ignoring the orders of a police 
officer, who observed Applicant to be yelling in a manner that he deemed to be 
disturbing the peace (SOR ¶ 1.d).18 While Applicant was not convicted of those charges, 
the matter was placed on the court’s stet docket and he was ordered to complete 32 
hours of community service.19 At hearing, Applicant denied any wrongdoing.20  
 
In 2007, Applicant was charged criminally after he operated a vehicle while 
intoxicated resulting in damage to the garage where it had been parked (SOR ¶ 1.e).21 
There is no evidence in the record about whether he was convicted of these charges. At

hearing, Applicant acknowledged wrongdoing and attributed his actions to being 
intoxicated.22  
 
In 2008, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana after he admitted to 
a police officer that the marijuana found in the vehicle that he was driving belonged to 
him (SOR ¶ 1.f).23 There is no evidence in the record about whether he was convicted 
of this charge. At hearing, Applicant initially denied any knowledge of this incident.24 
Later, after he was able to recall the incident, he denied any wrongdoing and claimed 
that the marijuana was not his but that he admitted to the officer that it was in order to 
protect his friends who were passengers in the vehicle.25  
 
In 2008, Applicant was involuntarily separated from the U.S. Army for a pattern of 
misconduct to include the incidents alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e (SOR ¶1.g).26 In his 
response to the separation action in 2008 and at his hearing, Applicant acknowledged 
wrongdoing.27 
 
In 2012, Applicant was convicted of driving with suspended registration (SOR ¶ 
1.i).28 At hearing, he explained that this incident related to a lapse in the insurance 
coverage required by State A’s motor vehicle administration.29 I have considered his 
testimony denying that he knowingly drove with a suspended registration and that he 
remedied the problem.30 Given the nature of the incident and the circumstances in light 
of the record as a whole, I find SOR ¶ 1.i in favor of Applicant. 
 
Applicant used marijuana in high school,31 twice in 2008,32 and once in 
approximately 2009 or 2010.33 He failed to list any marijuana use on either his 2006

(SOR ¶ 1.j)34 or 2009 SCA (SOR ¶ 1.k) by answering “no” to the relevant questions.35 
He also failed to disclose his complete history of marijuana use in his response to 2014 
Interrogatories propounded upon him by DOHA (SOR ¶1.l) by stating that he used 
marijuana in high school and “no use after.”36 Despite his claim at hearing to the 
contrary,37 he did not discuss his marijuana use during either his October 2009 or 
December 2010 security clearance interviews.38  
 
At hearing, Applicant claimed that confusion caused him to note in his response 
to 2014 Interrogatories that he used marijuana in high school “3 weekly.” Instead, he 
claimed that he only used marijuana “three or four times” in high school.39 While I do not 
find his confusion claim credible, I find that the discrepancy is not material to the issues 
at hand, which involve reporting his marijuana use regardless of the frequency. 
 
At hearing, Applicant firmly denied any intention to falsify information on either 
his 2006 or 2009 SCA or in his response to 2014 Interrogatories.40 He acknowledged 
that he marked “no” incorrectly on his 2006 SCA, but claimed that he was coached by 
his recruiter to do so after he told the recruiter about his high school marijuana use.41 
He also acknowledged that he marked “no” incorrectly on his 2009 SCA, but claimed no 
specific recollection as to why except for his belief that marijuana was not a drug and 
that since he only used it “rarely,” he did not see it as a problem.42 Similarly, he 
referenced a belief that his high school use was “here and there” and not “abuse” by 
way of explanation for his failure to disclose it.43 Applicant revealed his post-high school 
marijuana use only after being cross-examined by Department Counsel at hearing.44 
  
 Applicant acknowledged that youth, immaturity, and alcohol consumption 
contributed to his misconduct while in the military. He claims that he is not the same 
person and that he has matured over the years, especially since he got married and

became a father.45 A work colleague who has known Applicant for at least five years 
opines that he is a person of good moral character and judgment. His former manager 
found him to be dependable and an asset to his customer, his team, and his company. 
Another friend and work colleague who has known Applicant since 2012 describes him 
as an excellent problem solver who always exercises good judgment in stressful 
situations.46 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”47 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”48 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”49 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met

the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.51 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”52 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.53 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.54 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.55 
  
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”56 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”57  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
 
 The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15:  
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   
 
AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may 
be disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:

(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative; and 
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. 
 
 Applicant intentionally falsified materially relevant facts on both his 2006 and 
2009 SCAs and in his response to 2014 Interrogatories which establishes AG ¶¶ 16(a) 
and 16(b). Together with his pattern of misconduct between 2005 through 2008, his 
falsifications also establish AG ¶¶ 16(c). 
 
 AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. 
 
 
9 
 
AG ¶ 17(a) is not established. Applicant failed to avail himself of numerous 
opportunities to correct the falsifications of his 2006 and 2009 SCAs. Applicant did not 
discuss his marijuana use during either his October 2009 or December 2010 security 
clearance interviews. While he revealed his high school marijuana use in his response 
to 2014 Interrogatories, he failed to disclose post-high school marijuana use and, in fact, 
affirmatively denied it. Then, at his hearing, he admitted that he used marijuana after 
high school only after being questioned during Department Counsel’s cross-
examination. 
 
AG ¶ 17(b) is not established. I have doubts about whether Applicant’s recruiter 
specifically directed him to answer “no” to the relevant drug questions on his 2006 SCA. 
However, even if I were to find that he did so direct Applicant, this mitigating condition 
cannot apply given his repeated lack of candor about his marijuana use since then. 
  
AG ¶ 17(c) is not established. If Applicant’s pattern of misconduct and 
questionable judgment had ended in 2008, this mitigating condition could apply due to 
passage of time and I would have agreed that Applicant is reformed. However, this 
pattern is brought current by his lack of candor about his marijuana use not only in his 
2006 and 2009 SCAs but also in his response to 2014 Interrogatories and during the 
hearing. Having had an opportunity to evaluate his demeanor and credibility at hearing, 
I have serious doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
AG ¶ 17(d) is not established. While I credit Applicant with taking responsibility 
for his wrongdoing related to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g., he failed 
to take any responsibility for his actions related to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 
and 1.j through 1.l. Moreover, I am not convinced that the errors in judgment underlying 
his pattern of misconduct and dishonesty are unlikely to recur. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 
10 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(a). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his pattern of misconduct and questionable judgment, especially his 
repeated lack of candor about his marijuana use. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried 
his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a – 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.h – 1.i:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.j – 1.l:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is denied.
