DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant did not mitigate financial security concerns related to her failure to file 
state income tax returns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 6, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information effective within the DOD on September 1, 
2006.  
 Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on July 8, 2016, and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. On September 8, 2016, the Defense Office of 
 
 
 
 
2 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On November 23, 2016, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for December 8, 2016. The case was 
heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 
into evidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L into 
evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on December 19, 2016. The record remained open until January 20, 
2017, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence pertinent to the 
filing of state taxes for 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012. (Tr. 45.) On January 23, 2017, she 
submitted another document that I marked as AE M.  Department Counsel had no 
objection to the late filing, and AE M is admitted into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the sole allegation in the SOR. Her admission is incorporated 
into these findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 36 years old and divorced since 2011. She was married for nine 
years and has one child, eight-years old, from the marriage. She served in the Navy 
from 1998 until her honorable discharge in 2009 as an E-5. She deployed to the Middle 
East and other locations. While serving, she received two Navy Achievement Medals, a 
Good Conduct Medal, and other ribbons and awards. (Tr. 19-22; GE 1.) 
 
 After leaving the Navy, Applicant attended college full-time from 2010 until 2013, 
when she earned a bachelor’s degree. Between 2009 and 2013, she was unemployed 
and received unemployment compensation for two separate six-month periods. She 
then worked part-time until October 2013, when she obtained her current position with a 
defense contractor. (Tr. 22-23, 28, 34; GE 1.) She submitted a salary notification letter 
from 2015, noting her successful performance and a compensation bonus. (GE C.) 
 
 On April 8, 2014, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). In 
it, she disclosed that she had not filed her state income taxes for 2012, the reason being 
that she had been unemployed during that year. During a background interview in May 
2014, Applicant told the investigator that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified her 
in 2011 that she owed about $2,900 for unpaid 2010 federal taxes.1 She also mentioned 
that she had not filed her 2013 state tax return at this time. In her May 2016 response to 
the Government’s interrogatories, Applicant admitted that she had not timely filed state 
income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. In June 2016, DOD 
issued the SOR alleging that Applicant failed to file state income tax returns for years 
2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. (GE 1, 2.) 
 
 In response to a question about her answer to the Government’s interrogatories, 
in which Applicant admitted that she failed to file state returns for 2007, 2010, 2011, 
                                            
1 The SOR does not contain an allegation related to an outstanding state tax debt of $2,900 for the tax 
year of 2010. Hence, this fact will not be considered in an analysis of disqualifying conditions. It may be 
considered in the analysis of mitigating conditions, the whole-person concept, and Applicant’s credibility.

2012, and 2013, she testified, “I didn’t fail to file. I filed them. I just don’t have any 
documentation.” (Tr. 29.) She explained she had filed all of them, except 2007, of which 
she remained uncertain of the status. She then clarified that she did not file a state 
return for 2011 or 2012 because she thought, at the time, she did not have taxable 
income for those years, though she received unemployment benefits. Sometime in 
2011, she learned that those benefits were taxable. (Tr. 29-30, 34.)  
 
 Applicant attributed some tax filing problems to her former husband, who handled 
their finances until they separated in 2010. During 2007, she was deployed and she 
relied on him to file their taxes. After submitting her SF-86 in 2014, she learned that he 
had not filed the 2007 state tax return. She was now trying to determine how or whether 
she needed to file that state return because she was in the military in 2007 and a 
resident of another state. (Tr. 25, 31-32.)  
 
 Three weeks before this hearing, Applicant submitted a written request to the 
state for copies of all tax transcripts from 2007 to 2012. (Tr. 40.) She was also waiting 
for a response from the state about whether she was required to file a 2007 state return, 
because she was in the military and residing in another state in 2007. On or about 
January 20, 2017, she received a letter from the state indicating that her account for tax 
year 2007 was closed. (AE M.) 
 
  That letter also noted that on January 17, 2017, Applicant paid an outstanding 
2011 state tax bill for $589 and an outstanding 2014 state tax bill for $617.2 According 
to the state, those tax year accounts are now closed. (AE M.) The letter does not 
reference the status of 2010 and 2012 tax filings.  
 
 In summary, Applicant documented that she filed state tax returns for years 
2007, 2011, and 2013, as noted in the letter from the state and her tax preparer. The 
date on which she filed the 2007 and 2011 returns is unknown. She filed her 2013 state 
returns in April 2015. (Tr. 37, 43; AE H, M.) She did not submit documentation 
confirming that she filed or resolved state tax returns for 2010 and 2012.  
 
 Applicant’s annual salary is $68,000. She said her finances are stable. She 
submitted a credit report that indicates that she is resolving debts listed on it. (Tr. 46; AE 
K.) For the past six months, she has been working with a financial counselor to help her 
budget and pay expenses. (Tr. 27, 44-45.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list 
                                            
2 Neither of these facts regarding delinquent tax debts was alleged as a security concern in the SOR. 
Hence, they will not be considered in an analysis of disqualifying conditions. They may be considered in 
the analysis of mitigating conditions, the whole-person concept, and Applicant’s credibility.

potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
According to Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to 
establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an 
“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, 
and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance 
decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be 
“in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG & 18:  
 
 
 
 
 
5 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information.3 
 
AG ¶ 19 notes one disqualifying condition that could potentially raise security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
Applicant failed to file her state income tax returns on a timely basis for tax years 
2007 through 2013 as required. This conduct raises security concerns under this 
guideline, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those 
concerns. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with these things is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). 
Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of 
those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).4 
 
After the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying 
condition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of 
the security concerns. AG ¶ 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate 
financial security concerns under this guideline: 
                                            
3 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
4 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).

(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 Applicant’s conduct of security concern involved five years of disregard for her 
lawful income tax obligations to the state government. Except for 2007, her failure to 
timely file state tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 did not occur under unusual 
circumstances, and was relatively recent. She provided insufficient evidence that her 
disregard of state tax filing obligations was largely beyond her control. Additionally, she 
has not provided evidence that she filed or was excused from filing state returns for   
2010 or 2012. That omission continues to raise questions about her reliability, 
trustworthiness. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and (b) do not provide mitigation of the security concerns.  
 
 There is evidence that Applicant participated in financial and budgetary 
counseling. However, it is not clear whether that counseling included information 
regarding compliance with tax obligations. Her willful disregard of those obligations was 
lengthy, recent, and continues to date. The evidence does not support a determination 
that her financial problems are under control. Thus, she failed to establish mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant did not present sufficient evidence that she made a good-
faith effort to timely file or resolve any of the alleged tax years. AG ¶ 20(d) does not 
apply. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). They include the following: 
 
 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
 
 
 
 
7 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an intelligent and educated 
36-year-old woman, who honorably served in the military from 1998 to 2009. She 
documented that she is successful in her employment. These are positive factors in this 
case.  
 
However, Applicant’s history of failing to timely file state tax returns precludes her 
from present eligibility for a security clearance. She acknowledged that she failed to 
timely file her 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2013, in her SF-86, response to interrogatories, 
and Answer to the SOR. In a May 2014 interview, she discussed the unfiled tax returns 
for 2010 and 2013. During her testimony, she modified her admissions and said she 
filed all of the returns, except possibly 2007, but did not have documentation to prove it. 
The record remained open to give her an opportunity to submit that documentation. She 
subsequently demonstrated that she resolved three of the five alleged years: 2007, 
2011, and 2013. There is no evidence that she filed state tax returns for 2010 and 2012, 
or that she was not required to do so. At this time, she has not established a record of 
complying with state tax laws. Her actions to date are not sufficient to outweigh a history 
of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to file state tax returns.  
   
The record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:                      Against Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
