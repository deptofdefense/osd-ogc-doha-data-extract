GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 29, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On August 21, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to him, under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns 
                                                          
1 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated August 29, 2014).

under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the 
case file. On March 11, 2016, he responded to the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on May 2, 2016, and he was afforded an opportunity, 
within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material 
in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received 
the FORM on May 5, 2016. Applicant’s response was due on June 4, 2016, and on an 
unspecified date before then, he submitted some documents to which there was no 
objection. The case was assigned to me on February 10, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.q.). Applicant’s admissions and 
comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a cable 
installer with the company since July 2013, and before that, he was an installation 
supervisor for another employer from November 2007 until July 2013. Applicant was 
unemployed from May 2004 until August 2005. He is a high school graduate. He attended 
a university for approximately one school year in 2008-09, but did not receive a degree. 
He also attended a vocational college from 2010 until 2013, but did not receive a degree. 
He has never served in the U.S. military. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security 
clearance. Applicant was married in January 2009. He has no children.  
 
  
                                                          
2 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR was erroneously dated March 11, 2015. It should be noted that the affidavit 
form upon which Applicant was to choose either a hearing or a decision based upon the administrative record, and list 
his contact information, and which the notary public was to sign, was a boilerplate preprinted form with “2015” furnished 
to him. The correct date should be “2016.”

Financial Considerations3 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about the end of 2008. 
Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) in November 2014, and in that interview he acknowledged that 
during unspecified periods from November 2008 and November 2014, his wife had been 
“sporadically employed,” and they had to prioritize their accounts. Things apparently 
became worse towards the end of 2010, when she lost her job, and the entire family 
financial responsibility became his. Applicant’s resources were purportedly exhausted 
and accounts became delinquent. An automobile was voluntarily repossessed; student 
loans went into default; a rental property was foreclosed; and federal and state income 
tax returns were not timely filed. Applicant’s financial difficulties were exacerbated by his 
driving habits because he repeatedly received tickets from various municipalities for 
parking, speeding, or red light violations. Applicant stated that his salary had increased 
and he intended to repay all of his debts.  
In addition to the two allegations pertaining to the failure to timely file federal and 
state income tax returns, the SOR identified 15 delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, as generally reflected by the September 2014 credit report4 and 
the January 2016 credit report.5 Those debts, totaling $10,775, their current status, 
according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) refers to an automobile loan account with a high credit of $15,489 
that was $7,977 past-due and for which $8,031 was charged off in August 2012. In May 
2016 – five months after the SOR was issued – Applicant and the collection agent agreed 
to a repayment plan under which Applicant established pre-authorized $100 monthly 
payments, commencing on June 3, 2016.6 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.g.) refer to six student loan accounts with varying high 
credits ($4,000, $4,000, $4,500, $3,500, $3,500, and $2,625), unpaid balances ($4,595, 
$5,166, $4,783, $4,047, $4,047, and $3,036), and past-due balances ($415, $330, $433, 
$259, $259, and $194) that fell into a default status before Applicant was able to 
rehabilitate them.7 On January 20, 2015 – one year before the SOR was issued – 
Applicant and the U.S. Department of Education established a repayment plan under

exhibits: Item 3, supra note 1; Item 2 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated March 11, 2015); Item 5 (Personal Subject

September 10, 2014); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 11, 2016). More recent information can be found 
in the exhibits furnished and individually identified.

which he has been making monthly payments of $148.39, reducing the balance of 
$29,359.54 to $28,886.97.8 The accounts are in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h. through 1.m., and 1.o.) refer to seven tickets from various 
municipalities over a multi-year period (2010 through 2014) for parking, speeding, or red 
light violations in the amounts of $300, $100, $100, $100, $85, $85, and $55.9 On May 
24, 2016 – five months after the SOR was issued – Applicant paid off all of the fines.10 
The accounts have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.n.) refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $83.11 Applicant  
claimed that the bill simply slipped past him, and he contended that he had “paid it about 
a year ago,”12 also said to have occurred in August 2014,13 but he failed to submit any 
documentation, such as a cancelled check, receipt, credit card payment listing, etc., to 
support his contention that the bill had been paid. In the absence of such documentation, 
I conclude that the account remains unresolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.p. and 1.q.) refer to federal and state income tax returns for the tax 
years 2011, 2012, and 2013 that were allegedly not timely filed. In his e-QIP, Applicant, 
commented that “for my 2013 taxes, I filed an extension due to some documents that did 
not come in on time, and I believe my 2012 or [2011] have not been filed . . . and plan to 
get that resolved within this week.”14 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that 
he had not timely filed his federal income tax return for 2011 or his state income tax return 
for 2013, and indicated that both returns were “recently sent off.”15 Applicant’s federal 
income tax return for 2011 was received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on 
February 23, 2016, nearly four years late.16 His federal income tax return for 2012 was 
received by the IRS on April 15, 2013, indicating a timely filing.17 His federal income tax 
return for 2013 was received by the IRS on March 11, 2016, nearly two years late.18 It is 
unclear when Applicant filed his state income tax return for 2013, but he did file an

amended return shortly before May 25, 2016.19 The status of Applicant’s state income tax 
returns for 2011 and 2012 is unclear as Applicant failed to address those issues, and he 
failed to submit any documentation to indicate that he filed his state income tax returns 
for those years. 
According to Applicant’s federal income tax returns, he had adjusted gross 
incomes of $38,420 in 2011; $41,609 in 2012; and $58,363 in 2013.20 Applicant did not 
submit a Personal Financial Statement to reflect his current net monthly income; monthly 
expenses; or any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or 
savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of any financial 
counseling. It remains unclear if Applicant’s finances are under control. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”21 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”22   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”23 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.24  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”25  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”26 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
                                                          
23 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Under AG ¶ 19(g), security concerns may be raised when there is a 
“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in November 
2008, and increased during the ensuing years. Accounts became delinquent. A vehicle 
was voluntarily repossessed; student loans went into default; a rental property was 
foreclosed; and federal and state income tax returns were not timely filed. He accrued 
numerous parking, speeding, or red light violations. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”27  
AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d) minimally apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. 
Because of the nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties, I am unable to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
                                                          
27 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

As noted above, during unspecified periods from November 2008 and November 2014, 
Applicant’s wife had been “sporadically employed.” He claimed that things became worse 
towards the end of 2010, when she lost her job, and the entire family financial 
responsibility became his. He offered no documentation to reflect her income for the years 
during that entire period. He claimed that he exhausted his resources, but he never 
explained or offered documentation to identify those resources or how they were 
depleted. Furthermore, despite having exhausted his resources, Applicant still chose to 
obtain student loans to fund his education at a vocational college from 2010 until 2013. 
Applicant’s annual adjusted gross income increased from $38,420 in 2011 to 
$58,363 in 2013, but he still failed to take any positive action to resolve his delinquent 
accounts. Tickets accrued from 2010 through 2013 for various parking, speeding, or red 
light violations (with fines of $300, $100, $100, $100, $85, $85, and $55) were ignored 
until five months after the SOR was issued. There is little evidence to indicate efforts to 
contact his creditors to arrange repayment plans, and during the period November 2008 
until January 2015, Applicant simply ignored his creditors. In January 2015, he finally 
made the initial efforts to rehabilitate his student loans, and he started making modest 
monthly payments. He failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 
2011 and 2013 because of missing documentation. Applicant failed to adequately 
address his untimely filing of his state income tax returns for the tax years 2011 through 
2013. Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator in November 2014. That is when 
he should have started his good-faith resolution efforts. He failed to do so.  
The record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2011 and 2013, and his state income tax returns for the tax years 
2011, 2012, and 2013. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented:28 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information.

25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, 
does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course 
of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
Applicant procrastinated in taking steps to resolve his delinquent debts since 2010 
(when he first received various parking, speeding, or red light violations); since 2012 
(when his automobile loan was charged off); and 2013 (when a medical account went 
unpaid). It is unclear when his student loans went into default. With the exception of his 
delinquent student loans, which he finally took steps to rehabilitate after his OPM 
interview, Applicant offered little evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of his other 
accounts. His tickets for various parking, speeding, or red light violations were finally paid 
off, and he made his initial modest payments on his charged-off automobile loan, only 
after the FORM was issued. He addressed, to some degree, his federal and state income 
tax return issues, also only after the FORM was issued. He contended he paid off a 
medical account, but he failed to submit any documentation such as receipts, cancelled 
checks, account records, etc., to support his contentions.  
 
There is no evidence of a budget, financial counseling, or that his finances are 
under control. In failing to timely file his various federal and state income tax returns, and 
to resolve his long-standing delinquent debts until the FORM was issued, Applicant 
appears to have acted imprudently and irresponsibly. Applicant’s actions, or inactions, 
under the circumstances confronting him, continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.29 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have

evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.30       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. He candidly acknowledged having some financial 
difficulties when he completed his e-QIP. He finally took action to resolve some debts. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. Applicant’s explanation for his failure to comply with the law related to the 
timely filing of his federal and state income tax returns is simply too simplistic. He may 
have lost some documentation required to be attached to his income tax returns to meet 
the original filing dates, but he continued to ignore his filing responsibilities for several 
years thereafter. He offered no meaningful explanations for his failure to maintain his 
accounts in a current status, or why he did not take any earlier positive actions to resolve 
them well before the SOR or the FORM were issued. There is no evidence of a budget, 
financial counseling, or that his finances are under control.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
amended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b. through 1.g.:  For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.h. through 1.m.: Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.p. and 1.q.:  Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
