GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 6, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On October 31, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications 
and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed

reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, dated and notarized on December 1, 2015, Applicant responded to 
the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of 
a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on February 
11, 2016, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of 
the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the 
Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on February 17, 2016. 
On March 1, 2016, Applicant retained an attorney who immediately requested that the 
case be converted to a hearing in lieu of a decision to be made on the written record. The 
conversion was made, and on March 24, 2016, Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on June 6, 2016. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on June 28, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
July 13, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and 15 Applicant 
exhibits and sub-exhibits (AE) A through AE K, were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
July 21, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took 
advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted additional documents, which were 
marked and admitted as AE K through AE V, without objection. The record closed on 
August 10, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant specifically denied, with comments, all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶ 1.a. through 1.g.) of the SOR. 
Applicant’s comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been an 
assistant facility security officer and an administrative coordinator with the company since 
September 2009. He graduated from high school in 1983. He received an associate’s 
degree in 2009; a bachelor’s degree in 2010; and a master’s degree in 2014. Applicant 
enlisted in the U.S. Navy in September 1989, and he served honorably until he retired as 
an E-6 in September 2009. He has held a secret security clearance since approximately 
1990. Applicant was married in 1993. He has two children (a daughter born in 1994 and 
a son born in 1996).

Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his military career, Applicant was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps 
Commendation Medal; the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (4 awards); the 
Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (4 awards); the National Defense Service Medal (2 
awards); the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon (6 awards); the Good 
Conduct Medal (5 awards); the Navy Unit Commendation (2 awards); the Southwest Asia 
Service Medal; the NATO Medal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the Global 
War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; the Navy Pistol Marksman Ribbon; Navy 
Marksman Ribbon; and Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist. 
 
Financial Considerations2 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until he mandatorily retired 
from the U.S, Navy in September 2009. He had expected a promotion that would enable 
him to continue his military career for a few more years, but the promotion failed to 
materialize. The retirement left him ill prepared for the loss of income and benefits. In 
addition, his wife had been unemployed from some point in 2008 until January 2010, and 
again from November 2011 until November 2012. His current job paid him less than what 
he had been earning while on active duty. Applicant’s wife operated a home day care 
center under the auspices of the U.S. Navy, but when the military altered its program, 
Applicant’s wife was no longer eligible to operate such a center. The loss of income due 
to the variety of factors led to an inability to maintain his accounts in a current status. 
Various accounts, as well as his home mortgage, became delinquent. When his 
homeowners association (HOA) failed to repair a streetlight near his residence, Applicant 
withheld his $182 annual HOA dues. The HOA sued him and obtained a $1,738 judgment 
against him in September 2011.3  
 In 2011, Applicant contacted his creditors and collection agents in an effort to 
resolve his delinquent accounts. In 2012, he obtained a loan modification and reached 
out to address his other delinquent accounts. During the loan modification process in 
October 2012, Applicant received credit counseling, including guidance on establishing a 
bill paying system to pay off debts; establishing a flexible, yet realistic, budget; 
establishing a savings plan; increasing income; reducing expenses; recording daily 
spending; attending a financial event sponsored by his mortgage lender; and bringing his 
mortgage current.4

The SOR identified seven purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed 
for collection or gone to judgment, as reflected by the December 2012 credit report5 or 
the February 2015 credit report.6 Those debts, totaling approximately $13,543, and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the 
Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described 
below: 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a home mortgage with a high credit of $221,154 and a 
remaining balance of $217,601, of which $9,271 was reported as past due and in 
foreclosure as of November 2012.7 The February 2015 credit report reported a different 
scenario, reflecting a remaining balance of $224,286, of which $3,422 was reported as 
past due.8 In fact, commencing in 2012, working with the lender and a lender subsidiary, 
Applicant started the mortgage modification process, making the required monthly 
payments.9 The mortgage was eventually brought into a current status. Applicant’s April 
2016 loan account statement reflects no delinquency. His July 2016 credit report reports 
the account is current, and has been for the past seven months.10 The account has been 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a dental account with an unpaid co-pay balance of $19 that 
was placed for collection in 2012.11 Applicant’s wife was unaware that there was a 
delinquent co-pay, and she was under the impression that her dental insurance had 
covered the charges. She did not recall receiving any notices. When she first learned of 
the delinquency “a few years ago,” she paid it.12 The collection agent reported that the 
creditor had closed the account.13 The account is not reported in his July 2016 credit 
report. The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is the HOA account from which Applicant withheld his $182 
annual HOA dues. The HOA sued him and obtained a $1,738 judgment against him in 
September 2011.14 Applicant paid the judgment through a garnishment of his wages on

June 12, 2012, nearly three and one-half years before the SOR was issued.15 The 
account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a bank credit card account with $2,000 credit limit and unpaid 
and past-due balance of $4,546 that was placed for collection in 2012.16 Applicant learned 
about the account during his loan modification process, and he was initially under the 
impression that it was his account so he reported it in his e-QIP. He subsequently 
determined that the account belonged to his father who had passed away in 2011. 
Applicant and his father had the same names with different suffixes and a different 
spelling of their first names.17 Using an address listed in his credit report, Applicant initially 
sought to validate the account with a collection agent, but his correspondence was 
returned to him as not deliverable. He subsequently contacted the creditor to dispute the 
account and furnished certain requested information. Based on the information provided, 
the creditor researched the account and determined that the information in Applicant’s 
credit report was incorrect. The creditor removed the account from Applicant’s credit 
report.18 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a bank-issued warehouse club charge card account with a 
$500 credit limit and unspecified unpaid and past-due balances that was placed for 
collection and sold to a debt purchaser.19 The debt purchaser, referring to itself as a 
factoring company, reported that the high credit was $797 and the unpaid and past-due 
balance was $1,520.20 Using an address listed in his credit report, Applicant sought to 
validate the account with the debt purchaser, but his correspondence was returned to him 
as not deliverable.21 Applicant is unable to confirm that the account belonged to him and 
not to his father, and he had no further way to address the account in an effort to resolve 
it.22 However, he was eventually able to track the account through one collection agent to 
another collection agent, and in July 2016, the account was settled for the reduced 
amount of $600. Applicant made the first $300 payment on July 25, 2016, and the second 
and final $300 payment on August 1, 2016.23 The account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a bank-issued home improvement store charge card account 
with a $300 credit limit and unspecified unpaid and past-due balances that was placed 
for collection and sold to the same debt purchaser as above.24 The debt purchaser, again 
referring to itself as a factoring company, reported that the high credit was $533 and the 
unpaid and past-due balance was $1,017.25 Using an address listed in his credit report, 
Applicant sought to validate the account with the debt purchaser, but his correspondence 
was returned to him as not deliverable.26 Applicant is unable to confirm that the account 
belonged to him and not to his father, and he had no further way to address the account 
in an effort to resolve it.27 However, he was eventually able to track the account to another 
collection agent. He disputed the account and furnished certain requested information. 
Based on the information provided, the collection agent researched the account and 
determined that the information in Applicant’s credit report was incorrect. The collection 
agent removed the account from Applicant’s credit report.28 The account has been 
resolved. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance 
of $1,282 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.29 Applicant wrote 
the collection agent seeking validation of the account. In August 2016, the account was 
settled for the reduced amount of $720. Applicant made that payment on August 2, 
2016.30 The account has been resolved.  
In 2009, while on active duty, Applicant’s monthly income, including basic pay and 
allowances, totaled $5,090.77.31In August 2016, Applicant submitted a monthly budget 
reflecting a net monthly income, including his primary income, military pension, disability 
income, and wife’s income, of $6,166; monthly expenses of $4,639; and a monthly 
remainder of $1,527 available for discretionary saving or spending.32 In July 2016, 
Applicant estimated that he had $1,000 in savings, $200 plus in checking, and 
approximately $14,000 in his 401(k) retirement account.33 He has no delinquent debts,

history.34 
Work Performance and Character References 
 The facility security officer, who is also Applicant’s immediate supervisor at 
Applicant’s employer, is a retired U.S. Navy E-9 with 30 years’ service, and he has known 
Applicant since Applicant was hired in 2009. They have daily contact, eight hours per day, 
four or five days per week. He characterized Applicant in positive terms, using 
characterizations such as sensible, conscientious, reliable, and trustworthy.35 Applicant’s 
Annual Evaluations and Expectation Setting Forms from 2012 through 2016 reflect that 
Applicant’s compliance with the company core values were primarily “often exhibited,” 
with some items “always exhibited” or simply “exhibited.” His overall ratings over the 
period were generally “meets expectations,” although his most recent rating was “exceeds 
expectations.”36 Two former Navy colleagues, one of whom worked as a peer before 
being commissioned, have known and worked with Applicant for many years. They are 
both effusive in praise of Applicant’s character. One noted that Applicant was also active 
in the community and he has committed himself to developing young men and women.37 
Applicant’s sister handled their late father’s estate. She noted that their father had many 
debts when he died. She alerted Applicant to the possibility of a credit confusion regarding 
their father’s delinquent accounts being included in Applicant’s financial record. She 
characterized Applicant as reliable, trustworthy, and honest.38 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”39 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”40

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”41 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.42  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”43 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”44 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
                                                          
41 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose in 2009, and increased during the 
following few years. Several accounts became delinquent. One judgment was filed. AG 
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” In addition, under 
AG ¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that 
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.”45 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable basis 
                                                          
45 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
 
10 
                                      
 
to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence 
of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by his personal frivolous or irresponsible spending. In addition, it does 
not appear that he spent beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems arose during 
a period when the family income dropped significantly because of his retirement from the 
U.S. Navy and his wife’s business was terminated when the U.S. Navy altered the 
program under which she was operating. Accounts became delinquent only because of 
his insufficient income. To his credit, Applicant did not ignore his delinquent accounts, but 
instead, as early as 2011, he reached out to his creditors. The HOA issue arose when he 
withheld his annual $182 HOA fee in protest because they failed to repair a streetlight 
near his residence. Instead of resolving the street light issue, the HOA took the hard line 
and sued Applicant. The judgment the HOA obtained was eventually paid off by 
garnishment in June 2012, nearly three and one-half years before the SOR was issued, 
but because of inaccuracies in his credit report, that fact was never reported.  
 
Applicant’s major financial issue arose when his mortgage loan became past-due. 
In 2012, Applicant received credit counseling, and he obtained a mortgage modification. 
Following through on the modification process, he brought the mortgage current. Although 
there was an unsupported reference to the house being in foreclosure, that 
characterization proved to be false. The mortgage has been current for at least seven 
months. Two delinquent accounts were alleged to be Applicant’s accounts, but upon his 
disputes, it was determined that they were not, in fact, Applicant’s accounts. Applicant 
took repeated efforts to resolve other delinquent accounts, and his perseverance resulted 
in eventual resolutions.  
 
Applicant’s wife has returned to the workforce and their financial status has 
improved significantly. He now has a monthly remainder of $1,527 available for 
discretionary saving or spending. He has no other delinquent debts. Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. His perseverance and successful efforts reflect that he acted 
prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances confronting him, 
no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.46 
 
  
                                                          
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent 
to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.47       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His retirement from 
the U.S. Navy, and the loss of monetary benefits, occurred before he had adequately 
prepared financially for retirement. He failed to maintain his normal monthly payments 
regarding a number of accounts. A judgment was filed against him by the HOA. He fell 
behind in paying his home mortgage.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant is a well-respected employee and member of 
the community. His financial problems commenced when his anticipated promotion failed 
to materialize, and he was faced with a mandatory retirement. The retirement left him ill 
prepared for the loss of income and benefits. In addition, his wife’s income took a major 
blow when a home day care center she had operated under the auspices of the U.S. Navy 
was forced to close. Applicant chose not to ignore his delinquent debts. Instead, even 
before the SOR was issued, he extended himself to resolve the debts that existed. 
Applicant did not simply promise to address his debts, he actually did so.48 Applicant’s 
efforts have been successful, for all of the alleged delinquent accounts have either been 
                                                          
47 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
48 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

paid off or successfully disputed as not being his accounts. Applicant’s financial status 
has improved significantly, and he has no other delinquent accounts.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 49 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. He keeps track of his expenses and maintains a budget. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s security worthiness. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
