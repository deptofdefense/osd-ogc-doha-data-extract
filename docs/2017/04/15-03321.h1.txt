GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 17, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on March 16, 2016, and elected to have the 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government’s written case 
was submitted on June 6, 2016. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) 
was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and 
submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant 
 
2 
 
received the FORM on June 9, 2016. Applicant did not object to the Government’s 
evidence. The Government’s documents identified as Items 1 through 5 are admitted 
into evidence. Other than his Answer to the SOR, identified as Item 3, Applicant failed to 
submit any additional documentation. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 42 years old. He obtained his high-school diploma in 1993, attended 
community college from 1993 to 1996 but did not earn a degree, and received a 
certificate in 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from April 2002 until he 
was honorably discharged in March 2009, with a deployment to Iraq from August 2007 
to November 2008. He was granted a DOD security clearance when he served in the 
U.S. military. He worked for a prior federal contractor from April 2009 until December 
2012, when he began his current job with a federal contractor. He was previously 
married from 2001 to 2010, and has a 16-year-old daughter.1  
 
 The SOR alleges Applicant’s failure to timely file, as required, his federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012, as he had not done so until November 
20, 2015. It also alleges Applicant’s failure to file his state income tax returns for tax 
years 2009 through 2014, as he had not yet filed them as of January 17, 2016, the date 
of the SOR. In his March 2016 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted ¶ 1.a, and 
denied ¶ 1.b. He provided with his November 20, 2015 response to interrogatories, 
copies of his 2010, 2011, and 2012 federal income tax returns, which contain a file-
stamp date of November 20, 2015, from an IRS office in Applicant’s resident state. He 
maintained that he timely filed his 2009, 2013, and 2014 state income tax returns. He 
provided with his response to the SOR, copies of his 2009 through 2014 state income 
tax returns, all of which contain a file-stamp date of March 2016 from a taxpayer service 
center also in his resident state. He stated in his adopted December 2014 interview with 
an authorized DOD investigator that he intended to file his future tax returns in a timely 
manner.2 
                                                                                                                                       
 In his August 2014 Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86) and 
adopted December 2014 interview, Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his 2012 
federal and state tax returns to not getting them done before he went out of town, and 
then forgetting about them. He did not explain why he failed to timely file his 2010 and 
2011 federal tax returns, and only filed them on the same date as his response to 
interrogatories, nor did he explain why he failed to timely file his 2009 through 2011, 
2013, and 2014 state tax returns, and only filed them around the same time as his 
response to the SOR.3  
 
                                                          
1 Items 4-5. 
 
2 Items 1-5. He also provided copies of his 2007, 2009, and 2013 through 2014 federal tax returns, 
showing that he timely filed his 2007 and 2008 federal tax returns, and filed his 2009, 2013, and 2014 
federal tax returns by May of that tax year’s April filing deadline. Item 5. 
 
3 Items 1-5.

Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same.  
 
Applicant failed to file timely file, as required, his 2010 through 2012 federal 
income tax returns, as well as his 2009 through 2014 state income tax returns. There is 
sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control. 
  
 Applicant provided documentation to show that he filed his 2010 through 2012 
federal income tax returns on November 20, 2015, the same date as his response to 
interrogatories. While he maintained that he timely filed his 2009, 2013, and 2014 state 
tax returns, his documentation shows that he filed his 2009 through 2014 state tax 
returns in March 2016, around the same time as his response to the SOR. His failure to 
 
5 
 
timely file his relevant tax returns casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. 
 
Applicant failed to present evidence of circumstances beyond his control that 
impaired his ability to timely file his tax returns. To the contrary, Applicant attributed his 
failure to timely file his 2012 federal and state tax returns to not getting them done 
before he went out of town, and then forgetting about them. He also failed to explain 
why he did not timely file his 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns, as well as his 2009 
through 2011, 2013, and 2014 state tax returns. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. 
 
Although Applicant has filed his delinquent tax returns and stated that he plans to 
timely file his future tax returns, there is little reason to conclude that Applicant will 
comply with the law in the future. Applicant has not established a track record of 
financial responsibility. AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant served in the U.S. military from 2002 to 2009, during which time he was 
deployed overseas in 2007, and was granted a DOD security clearance. He has worked 
for a defense contractor since April 2009, and for his current company since December 
2012. However, Applicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. 
The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
