Decision 
__________ 
 
Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not make sufficient progress filing his state and federal tax returns 
and paying his taxes. His violations of rules, excessive alcohol consumption, and 
marijuana possession and use are not recent. Drug involvement, personal conduct, and 
alcohol consumption trustworthiness concerns are mitigated. Financial considerations 
trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 23, 2014, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (e-QIP) (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On June 7, 2016, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security 
Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines E (personal 
conduct); G (alcohol consumption), F (financial considerations), and H (drug 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
involvement). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue 
Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive 
information. (HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On July 8, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) On August 
19, 2016, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On October 13, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On December 22, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for January 
18, 2017. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government 
provided six exhibits; Applicant offered one exhibit; and all exhibits were admitted into 
evidence without objection. (Tr. 13-14; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) On January 
26, 2017, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.). The record was initially held 
open until March 20, 2017, and after two extensions elapsed, on April 25, 2017, the 
record closed. (Tr. 58, 70; HE 4) No post-hearing documents were received. (HE 4)

Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant was the victim of fraud. (Tr. 16, 26) His checks and credit cards were 
stolen, and his checks were forged. (Tr. 26) He filed a police report with the local police 
and sheriff’s department for the stolen checks and forged documents. (Tr. 26) In 
November or December 2016, he employed a law firm to dispute and validate his 
accounts on his credit report. (Tr. 16, 28) I requested that Applicant provide a copy of 
the validation and dispute report from the law firm (Tr. 69); however, no post-hearing 
documentation was provided. He promised to pay the debts that are verified. (Tr. 25) 
His fiancée passed away about six years ago, and he had expenses from four minor 
children and court costs from litigation over the custody of the children. (Tr. 24) Two of 
his children are in college, and the other two live in Applicant’s home. (Tr. 29) 
 
 Applicant recognized his landlord as the creditor in SOR ¶ 4.e for $581; however, 
he did not believe he owed his landlord. (Tr. 22-23) He paid a debt for about $2,000. 
(Tr. 25) He acknowledged responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 4.c for $1,495 relating to 
his repossessed vehicle. (Tr. 49-50) He plans to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 4.c; however, he 
did not present any evidence about resolution of this debt. (Tr. 50-51)  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists five medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 4.h through 4.l for $1,759, 
$743, $477, $222, and $143. (Tr. 51) Applicant had medical insurance, and he did not 
understand the basis for the medical debts. (Tr. 51-52)  
 
In addition to the debts previously discussed, Applicant’s SOR alleges the 
following debts: ¶ 4.d is collection debt for $811; ¶ 4.e is a collection debt for $581; ¶ 4.f 
is a telecommunications-collection debt for $478; ¶ 4.g is a collection debt for $250; ¶ 
4.m is a charged-off bank debt for $707; ¶ 4.n is a collection debt for $949; ¶ 4.o is a 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
publishing company collection debt for $176; ¶ 4.p is a telecommunications-collection 
debt for $148; and ¶ 4.q is a library-collections debt for $110. In his SOR response, he 
denied all of these debts. During his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview 
Applicant denied knowledge or responsibility for the delinquent debts on his credit 
report, except for SOR ¶ 4.c relating to his repossessed vehicle. (Tr. 52; GE 2)  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 4.a and 4.b allege that Applicant did not file his state and federal tax 
returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. Applicant said he relied on his employer to 
withhold sufficient funds to pay his taxes, and he relied on the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) and the state tax authorities to send orders to his employers if additional funds 
were required. (Tr. 17-18, 31, 59-61) He has not filed his tax returns for tax years 2013, 
2014, and 2015. (Tr. 31-32)2 His SCA indicates he has followed this process with the 
government determining his taxes throughout his working career from the age of 16. 
(GE 1) He told the OPM investigator that he never filed state or federal tax returns and 
relied on the state or federal government to determine how much he owed. (GE 2) He 
said the IRS and/or the state were receiving $75 monthly. (Tr. 31) He estimated he 
owed about $4,000 for tax years 2013 and 2014. (Tr. 32) He had an appointment for 
January 20, 2017, to made arrangements with a commercial tax-return preparer to 
prepare his unfiled tax returns. (Tr. 18-19) I requested that Applicant provide his federal 
tax transcripts for the last five years and his state tax documentation; however, no post-
hearing documentation was provided. (Tr. 62) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant’s human resources director described Applicant as “an employee in 
good standing.” (AE A) Applicant is a trustworthy employee and “has not had any 
performance or attendance issues.” (AE A) 
                                            
2 Applicant’s SOR does not include four allegations: (1) he did not timely file his 2015 state and 
federal income tax returns; (2) he owes about $4,000 for delinquent state and federal income taxes; (3) 
he may not have paid his fine for his most recent driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) conviction; 
and (4) he did not timely file several state or federal tax returns prior to tax year 2013. In ISCR Case No. 
03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not 
alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). 
These four allegations will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7, C3.1.2.2, and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of national security and sensitive records is paramount. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s SOR response, 
SCA, OPM interview, credit reports, and hearing record establish the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important positive financial information. Circumstances beyond his control adversely 
affected his finances: Applicant was the victim of fraud; his fiancée passed away and he 
became solely responsible for his four children; and he had litigation expenses related 
to child custody. In November or December 2016, he employed a law firm to dispute 
                                            
3 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

and validate his accounts on his credit report. He promised to pay the debts that are 
verified.  
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The SOR 
alleges, and the record establishes that Applicant has failed to file his federal and state 
income tax returns for several years. He currently owes about $4,000 in taxes.  
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.4 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax 
returns against him as a federal crime. See note 2, supra. He did not receive notice of a 
Guideline J or E trustworthiness concern in the SOR about his failure to file his tax 
returns. 
 
The record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file several federal and state 
income tax returns. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961).

4 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, 
reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  
make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times 
required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be 
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v.

at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 
2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [applicant’s trustworthiness] in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax 
returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and 
employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of 
access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt 
of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when the tax returns were filed in ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance, “By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons 
granted access to classified information.” ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 
15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debt resulting from his repossessed 
vehicle alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. He did not describe any progress resolving the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.c. His explanations do not mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness 
concerns. 
 
Drug Involvement 
 
AG ¶ 24 articulates the trustworthiness concern concerning drug involvement: 
 
[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) could raise a 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “any drug abuse”;5 and 
“illegal drug possession.” Applicant used and possessed marijuana from June 2009 to 
October 2012.6 AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) apply. 
 
  AG ¶ 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating 
conditions:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  
 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance 
for any violation. 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; 
and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, 
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional. 
  
                                            
5AG ¶ 24(b) defines “drug abuse” as “the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner 
that deviates from approved medical direction.”  
 
6AG ¶ 24(a) defines “drugs” as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: 
 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other 
similar substances. 
 
Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. § 
812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. See Drug Enforcement Administration 
listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 
U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant has not possessed and used marijuana since October 2012. His 
marijuana possession and use is not recent. Drug involvement trustworthiness concerns 
are mitigated.   
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Two alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b), 22(d), through 22(g) do not apply. There was no evidence of: 
alcohol impairment or intoxication at work; an alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, or 
alcohol use disorder diagnosis; and failure to follow any court orders concerning alcohol 
use.  
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Applicant was cited or charged with DUI nine times 
from 1983 to 2011. He was convicted of DUI in 1989, 1993, and 2010. He also had 
arrests for other alcohol-related offenses such as driving with an open container of 
alcohol, underage drinking of alcohol, and public intoxication. He engaged in binge 
alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.7     
  
  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-23(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
                                            
7 The term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Adjudicative Guidelines.
 
“Binge drinking is the 
most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States. See the Center for Disease Control 
website, (stating “The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a 
pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or 
above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or 
more drinks, in about 2 hours.” https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm.  
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
AG ¶ 23(b) applies. There is no evidence of irresponsible alcohol consumption 
after Applicant’s DUI arrest in 2011. He has received some alcohol-related counseling 
over the years. 
 
Trustworthiness and security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially 
under Guideline G, because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and 
rehabilitation show many different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has 
determined in cases of substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate 
trustworthiness or security concerns unless there was a fairly lengthy period of 
abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. 
Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case 
No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).     
 
I have carefully considered the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption and Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption. He has a sustained period 
of responsible alcohol consumption. His alcohol consumption has not been the primary 
cause of any incidents involving the police, courts, or at his employment since 2011.  
Applicant has eliminated doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment in relation to his alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption trustworthiness 
concerns are mitigated.   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or 
rule violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing. . . .  
 
From 1981 to 2011, Applicant was involved in 25 incidents involving the police 
and/or the courts. He was convicted of 14 offenses. AG ¶¶ 16(d)(3) and 16(e) are 
established. 
 
AG ¶ 17 lists four conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns in this 
case: 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability. 
 
Applicant engaged in a lengthy series of traffic violations and crimes from 1983 to 
2011. Some of the arrests, charges, and citations did not result in convictions or findings 
 
15 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
of guilty. His misconduct is not recent. AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) apply, and personal 
conduct trustworthiness concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F, H, G, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in 
AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old customer service clerk employed by the same 
contractor since 2002. His youngest four children are ages 15, 18, 21, and 25. He 
attended a business college. He has a real estate license and a bookkeeper certificate. 
Several of Applicant’s family members served in the military, and Applicant enjoys 
supporting the military. His human resources director described Applicant as “an 
employee in good standing.” (AE A) He is a trustworthy employee and “has not had any 
performance or attendance issues.” (AE A) 
 
Several circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances: after 
the death of his fiancée, he became solely responsible for his four youngest children; he 
had litigation expenses related to child custody; and he was the victim of fraud. He took 
action to attempt to verify his responsibility for his debts, and he made some payments. 
 
Applicant has not filed his state and federal tax returns for several years.8 He 
also owes about $4,000 in taxes.     
                                            
8The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security and trustworthiness concerns arising from 
tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of 
security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then 
taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant 
has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected 
of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 
 
16 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of 
access to sensitive information. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of access to sensitive 
information to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform 
necessary for award of a public trust position in the future. With a track record of 
behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive 
evidence of his worthiness for a public trust position.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Drug involvement, personal conduct, and alcohol consumption trustworthiness 
concerns are mitigated; however, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.y:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline G:     FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 3, Guideline H:     FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 3.a:    For Applicant 
 
                                                                                                                                            
2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

Paragraph 4, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 4.a through 4.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 4.d through 4.q:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
