LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He did not produce sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial 
history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on March 4, 2015. This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. About a year later on April 12, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information.1 The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG),

action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations, 
Guideline B for foreign influence, and Guideline E for personal conduct. He answered 
the SOR with a one-page memorandum on June 9, 2016, and he requested a hearing. 
Department Counsel withdrew the SOR allegations under Guideline B for foreign 
influence and Guideline E for personal conduct on August 10, 2016.2 
 
The case was assigned to me September 13, 2016. The hearing was held as 
scheduled on November 8, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1-6, and they 
were admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits A and B, and 
they were admitted. The transcript of hearing (Tr.) was received November 15, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 59-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for his job 
as a network designer/engineer with a company doing business in the defense industry. 
He has worked for this company since 2008. His educational background includes a 
bachelor’s degree. He is married, and he and his spouse have two adult children, ages 
26 and 19.   
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the SOR alleged a history of 
financial problems or difficulties consisting of the following matters: (1) a 1997 Chapter 7 
bankruptcy ending in discharge; (2) a charged-off credit card account for $3,775; and 
(3) a charged-off line of credit or loan for $16,327. In his answer to the SOR, he did not 
address the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, he denied the charged-off credit card account 
on the basis that it had already been paid, and he admitted the other charged-off 
account, explaining it was related to medical and other related expenses for his 
children’s care for a serious medical condition.    
 
 Applicant explained that the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was related to a cross-
country move that resulted in leaving a house behind that was to be rented to tenants.3 
The Chapter 7 bankruptcy paperwork shows that Applicant and his spouse received a 
standard discharge, with total assets valued at $93,911, and total liabilities valued at 
$103,628.4 Listed as secured liabilities were an automobile loan for $16,181, first and 
second mortgage loans for about $63,477 in total, and HOA dues of $2,342. Listed as 
unsecured liabilities were six credit card accounts, a small medical account, a small 
collection account, and two student loan accounts.  
 
 Applicant explained that the $3,775 charged-off account stems from a credit card 
account, post-bankruptcy, that he had thought had been paid off during a refinancing of 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG were published in 
the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

a mortgage loan.5 In time the account was referred to a collection agency, and Applicant 
settled the account for a lesser amount (about $1,800) in February 2013.6  
 
 Applicant explained that the $16,327 charged-off account stems from an 
unsecured line of credit or loan that was obtained to pay for medical and other related 
expenses due to his children’s care.7 The March 2015 credit report, which was obtained 
during his background investigation, shows the account was opened in December 2010, 
went into collection, and was then charged off in the amount of $16,327.8 He was asked 
about this debt during his May 2015 background investigation, and he stated that he 
was unaware when it became delinquent because his spouse takes care of the family 
finances.9 He further explained that he intended to set the account up for a monthly 
payment of $320. At the hearing, he explained that they are trying to work with the 
creditor to reach a settlement for a lesser amount.10 He produced no documentation 
showing a payment record or other progress in resolving the account. Applicant’s most 
recent October 2016 credit report lists the account as a negative item, and its current 
status is described as charged off in the amount of $16,327.11   
 
 Applicant stated that his annual base salary is about $93,000, plus a bonus of 
$3,000 to $5,000.12 His wife is employed outside the home as a cosmetologist earning 
about $35,000 to $40,000 annually.13 He stated that he has about $2,000 to $3,000 in a 
checking account, a few hundred dollars in a savings account, and about $93,000 in a 
401(k) account.14 He said he was currently repaying a $25,000 loan against his 401(k) 
account for his children’s college expenses.15

Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.16 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”17 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.18 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.19 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.20 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.21 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.22 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.23 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.24 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.25

Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,26 the suitability of an applicant 
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about a [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information.27 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His financial problems 
appear to be the result of an over reliance on credit as well as an inattention to his 
financial affairs. Normally, a 20-year-old Chapter 7 bankruptcy case would not present 
much of a current problem, but it is part of a long-term pattern of inattention to his 
financial affairs. He is credited with acting in good faith by settling the charged-off credit 
card account in 2013, well before the current security clearance process began. 
Unfortunately, he has taken no concrete action to address the largest delinquent debt, 
the $16,327 charged-off account. That account was opened in 2010, and it has been on

the books for several years. He was put on notice that the debt was an item of concern 
during his 2015 background investigation, yet he has done little to resolve it.   
 
 Considering the totality of circumstances, I am not persuaded that Applicant’s 
financial problems are due to circumstances largely beyond his control, and that he has 
acted responsibly under difficult and trying circumstances. Without doubt, his children’s 
serious medical condition are circumstances beyond his control, but he has not acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. The facts establish that he has not made a 
serious, good-faith effort to resolve a large charged-off account. At this point, given his 
proclivity for inattention to his financial affairs, it is too soon to tell if he will follow 
through on his stated intention to resolve the charged-off account.   
 
 Applicant’s history of financial problems creates doubt about his reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. Accordingly, I conclude 
that he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
