HESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant experienced financial difficulties due to a lengthy period of inconsistent 
employment, but mitigated the concern by acting responsibly. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on July 23, 2014. On 
October 15, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
  
Applicant submitted Answer to the SOR on January 22, 2016, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
May 6, 2016, and the case was assigned to me on June 24, 2016. On August 23, 2016, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing 
2 
 
was scheduled for September 13, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and I kept the record open until September 27, 2016, to enable him to 
submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted a statement and two 
documents (AX A through AX C), which I have admitted without objection. DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr.) on September 21, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately 
$34,981. These delinquent debts primarily include credit-card accounts, medical bills, and 
a motorcycle loan. In his Answer, Applicant admits 15 of the allegations and denies 5. He 
also states that he paid five of the debts, is paying four of the debts, and that two of the 
debts are duplicates. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. The 
delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBR) from September 
2015 and August 2014. (GX 3; GX 2.)  
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old simulation interactor currently employed by a defense 
contractor since January 2015, and employed in the defense industry since December 
2009. He served honorably in the U.S. Army reserve from April 2000 until August 2004, 
when he received his commission. He served as an officer on active duty from August 
2004 until December 2009. He was deployed in Afghanistan from October 2006 until 
January 2008.  Applicant received a bachelor’s of science degree in August 2004. He has 
held a secret clearance since at least 2004. He and his wife married in 2006, and they 
have a 5-year-old son. Applicant also has a 15-year-old son from a prior relationship. 
Applicant’s older son resides with his mother and Applicant provides monthly support of 
at least $200. Applicant’s wife and younger son reside in another state. Applicant lives 
away from his family in order to maintain his employment. (GX 1; Tr. 58-60.)  
 
While in the service, Applicant bought a car and used his credit cards for consumer 
purchases, and was easily able to maintain the monthly payments along with his other 
financial obligations. However, he began experiencing financial difficulties after he left 
active duty in 2009. He started work with a defense contractor in December 2009, and 
was employed until February 2010, when the contract ended. From 2009 until 2015, he 
worked sporadically on contracts, experiencing short periods of employment followed by 
periods of unemployment. As a result, Applicant became delinquent on his financial 
obligations. (Tr. 28-32.) 
Applicant has been steadily employed, fulltime, since January 2015. (Tr. 31.) 
Applicant’s wife is employed, maintains her own household expenses, and provides 
medical insurance for her and Applicant’s son. Applicant sends money when he can. (Tr. 
58-60.) With the exception of the $260 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) and the $442 cable bill 
(SOR ¶ 1.r), incurred in 2013, all the SOR debts were incurred between late 2009 and 
2012, as a result of Applicant’s erratic income. During his periods of unemployment, 
Applicant sold his personal belongings so he could pay rent and other necessary 
expenses without incurring additional debt. (Tr. 24.)  
3 
 
In June 2010, Applicant discontinued his cable television service to reduce his 
expenses, but failed to timely return the equipment, which gave rise to the $367 cable bill 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. He subsequently paid the bill and resumed service. (Tr. 24.) He 
again discontinued his cable service in November 2013, failed to return the equipment, 
and incurred the $442 cable bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r. Applicant paid the account, and 
resumed service. He currently has cable service with the second provider and the debt 
does not appear on the September 2015 CBR. (Tr. 35-36; GX 3.) 
Applicant paid the $179 past-due credit-card account. (SOR ¶ 1.m.) He later 
opened a low-credit-limit credit card with the same creditor, which he maintains for 
emergency use, and in an effort to begin reestablishing his credit. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant 
asserts that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.n, and 1.o are duplicates of a single line 
of credit used for the purchase of furniture. He paid this account in 2015. (Tr. 39-40; Tr. 
66.) 
Applicant paid the two $50 accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.t in April 2008, 
before clearing his duty station. (Tr. 54; Answer.) He made payments during periods of 
employment on the $4,125 credit-card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, and on the $1,884 
loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. He contacted the two creditors to resume payments, which 
began in October 2016. (Tr. 50-53; AX A.) He entered repayment plans with the creditor 
of SOR debts 1.d and 1.g, and began monthly payments in October 2016. (AX A – AX 
C.) 
The $16,069 past-due debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l is for a loan for a motorcycle that 
was later repossessed. The initial loan was $15,000 in March 2014, with a balance of 
$14,365 at the time of repossession in April 2010. The balance current does not reflect 
any resale offset. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 48-51.) Applicant was unemployed and unable to make 
payments, and the motorcycle was repossessed. He has not been contacted by the 
creditor recently. (Tr. 48-50.) Applicant owes the $1,000 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p for a 
timeshare he no longer owns. He has contacted the creditor several times and will pay 
this debt through monthly installments. (Tr. 42.) 
Applicant disputes the $2,424 on-line university debt opened in 2010 and charged-
off in 2014. (SOR ¶ 1.b.) He never registered for classes at this university, and was not 
in a position to do so in 2010. He spoke with the creditor and explained this, and has not 
been contacted by the creditor since. (Tr. 43-44; Tr. 61.) He also disputes the $513 
cellular service bill (SOR ¶ 1.q) on the basis that he maintains an account with this service 
and does not have a past-due balance. (Tr. 49-50.) 
Applicant disputes the $635 (SOR ¶ 1.e); $260 (SOR ¶ 1.h); and, $170 (SOR ¶ 1.j) 
medical accounts. He receives medical treatment only through the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA). He has not incurred medical bills for his wife or either of his sons. 
(Tr. 45-46.) He also disputes the $209 charged-off automobile loan. (SOR ¶ 1.i.) He stated 
that this account was for a car he purchased in 2004 and paid off in 2011. (Tr. 38; GX 3.) 
Although Applicant has been in his current job since January 2015, he continues 
to seek more stable employment. He lives within his means and has not incurred any 
significant delinquent debt since 2012. (Tr. 56; GX 2; GX 3.) He is currently enrolled in 
4 
 
courses at a technical college, which is being paid for through the VA. (Tr.55.) He was 
contrite, candid, and straight-forward while testifying. He accepts responsibility for his 
delinquent debts and will continue to steadily repay them. (Tr. 69-70.)  
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant’s meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  
 
5 
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
  
 Applicant’s testimony, corroborated by the record evidence, establishes two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”).  
 
 However, a person can mitigate concerns about his ability to handle and safeguard 
classified information raised by his financial circumstances by establishing one or more 
of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline. The relevant mitigating conditions 
in this case are: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
6 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s financial difficulties arose from circumstances largely beyond his 
control. As a result of the instability in his employment for over five years, Applicant was 
unable to maintain his financial obligations. He acted responsibly by making lifestyle 
changes to reduce his financial obligations, and to not incur additional debt. He has not 
incurred any significant delinquent debt since 2012.  
 
 Applicant acted in good faith by paying six of his debts, entering repayment 
agreements for four others, disputing one debt, and contacting the creditor of another 
debt. “Good faith” means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, 
and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a person’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case 
No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish resolution 
of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines 
do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor 
do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
    
 Although Applicant’s finances are not perfect, he has implemented a reasonable 
plan to repay his creditors. The circumstances which led to his indebtedness are unlikely 
to recur, and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(e) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
7 
 
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also 
considered the following: 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the military. He has held a security clearance for at 
least 13 years. He made personal sacrifices, such as living away from his wife and son, 
and selling his personal belongings to prevent incurring additional debt. He lives within 
his means, and is continuing to pursue his education. I am confident that Applicant will 
continue his good-faith efforts to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. 
  
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and his omissions on his 
e-QIP. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
  
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.t:    For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
