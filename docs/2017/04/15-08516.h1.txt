GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 23, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to those 
interrogatories on March 3, 2016.2 On March 25, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For

Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications 
and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The 
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on April 5, 2016. On April 7, 2016, he responded to 
the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.3  Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on May 16, 2016. The case was 
assigned to me on June 6, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 28, 2016. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled on July 13, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4 were admitted 
into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
July 21, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took 
advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted several documents, which were 
marked and admitted as Applicant exhibits (AE) L through AE G, without objection. The 
record closed on August 10, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a number of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b., 1.d. through 1.g., 1.l., and 1.m.).4 
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration 
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
computer technician with the company since June 2015. He previously held a number of 
disparate positions as a technical support technician, loss prevention officer, residential 
living assistant, correctional officer, and insulation technical manager with a variety of 
employers. He is a 2004 high school graduate. He earned some college credits and 
completed some certification programs, but he has not earned a degree. He has never 
served in the U.S. military. It is unclear if he was ever granted a security clearance other 
than on an interim basis in 2003. Applicant was married in 2007, separated in 2008, and 
divorced in 2013. He has three biological daughters with his wife, born in 2007, 2009, and 
2014, as well as a biological daughter, born in 2012, from another relationship. He was 
                                                          
3 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR was erroneously dated April 7, 2015. It should be noted that the affidavit form 
upon which Applicant was to choose either a hearing or a decision based upon the administrative record, and list his 
contact information, and which the notary public was to sign, was a boilerplate-preprinted form with “2015” furnished to 
him. The correct date should be “2016.” 
 
4 Two administrative errors were identified in the SOR, including two ¶ 1.b. allegations, and an erroneous 
creditor reference. Upon the motion of Department Counsel, and without objection by Applicant, the second ¶ 1.b. was 
amended to ¶ 1.c., and the identity of the creditor was corrected. See Tr. at 71, 75.

also under the impression that another child of his wife, born in 2011, was his biological 
child, but a paternity test proved he was not the father. 
 
Financial Considerations5 
It is unclear when Applicant started to experience financial difficulties, but a review 
of his 2015 credit report reveals some delinquent accounts as early as 2008 and 2009. In 
addition, Applicant referred to conflicting dates of unemployment in 2008. He went 
through another brief period of unemployment in 2015. In addition, Applicant attributed 
some of his financial issues to his late father having the same name (his father was a 
senior, and Applicant is a junior), a difficult marriage, separation, contentious divorce, 
child custody litigation, and paternity test fees, as well as some activities by his ex-wife. 
Without his knowledge or approval, Applicant’s ex-wife opened some accounts in his 
name and failed to make the required payments. It is unclear if her actions took place 
while they were separated or divorced. He had given her the funds to pay normal 
household bills, but she did not do so. In addition, shortly after they were married, 
Applicant purchased an automobile for his wife with the understanding that she would be 
responsible for the monthly payments. She again failed to do so. The lender obtained a 
judgment against Applicant and sought to repossess the vehicle. Applicant learned where 
his wife was hiding the vehicle and furnished that information to the lender. The 
combination of additional expenses and reduced income left him without the financial 
resources to maintain his accounts in a current status. Some accounts became 
delinquent, the vehicle was repossessed, and child support slipped into arrears. He 
became aware of some financial problems and engaged the professional services of a 
credit repair organization to address his concerns. Applicant eventually reached out to his 
creditors in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He disputed, paid off, is currently 
making payments, or settled nearly all of his accounts.  
The SOR identified 13 purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, as reflected by the 2015 credit report. Those debts, totaling 
approximately $11,193, and their respective current status, according to the credit 
reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s 
comments regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This refers to the automobile finance account with a high credit of 
$14,396, for which a judgment was filed in August 2008 in the amount of $3,857.6 
Applicant contended that the vehicle was eventually repossessed and sold, leaving no 
deficiency.7 Although the account was paid in full to the satisfaction of the creditor on

January 9, 20128 - over four years before the SOR was issued – the 2015 credit report 
continued to report the false narrative that the account was still outstanding. The account 
has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This refers to a power utility account with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $514 that was placed for collection in 2008.9 Applicant contended that he had 
given his wife funds to pay the bill but she failed to do so.10 He had forgotten about the 
bill until it was brought up during his August 2015 interview with an investigator from the 
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant immediately paid the creditor 
$250 before the SOR was issued, and he made the remaining payment on July 22, 2016, 
the week following the hearing.11 The account now has a zero balance.12 The account 
has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This refers to a furniture rental and installment sales account with an 
unpaid and past-due balance of $464 that was placed for collection and charged off in 
August 2009.13 Applicant stated that his wife had opened the account in his name without 
his knowledge. When he contacted the creditor, he was informed that the furniture had 
been repossessed, and there was no further balance. He also said that if there were an 
outstanding balance, he would pay it off.14 Applicant failed to submit any documentation 
to support his contentions, so I am unable to determine the true status of the account. 
The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This refers to an unspecified credit union account with a high credit 
of $8,637 and zero unpaid and past-due balances that was placed for collection. An 
unspecified amount was charged off in August 2009.15 Applicant contended that this 
account is a duplicate of the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g., but he is in error, for he is 
confusing two separate credit union accounts.16 Applicant offered no documentary 
evidence that this particular account had been addressed or resolved. The account has 
not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.g.): These two allegations refer to snapshots of the same credit 
union credit card account with a $1,500 credit limit that was placed for collection. An

unspecified amount was charged off, and the account was sold to a debt purchaser 
identified as a factoring company.17 The debt purchaser reported the unpaid balance to 
be $1,786.18 On July 15, 2016 – two days after the hearing – Applicant paid the debt 
purchaser $1,075, and the account is considered by that company to have a zero 
balance.19 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This refers to a cellular phone account with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $398 that was placed for collection.20 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated that he was currently paying the creditor.21 While Applicant failed to submit 
documentation to specifically reflect payments made, such as receipts, cancelled checks, 
or bank account statements, it appears that the account was resolved on July 19, 2016. 
On that date, the creditor referred to amendments having been filed with the credit 
bureaus to report the account had been paid as a collection account.22 The account has 
been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.i.): These refer to two medical accounts with unpaid balances 
of $501 and $358 that were placed for collection.23 Applicant disputed the debts, claiming 
that they were his late father’s debts, but he acknowledged that he never attempted to 
contact the creditors or collection agents to follow up on his disputes.24 In the absence of 
documentation to support Applicant’s contentions regarding the accounts being his 
father’s accounts, as well as no evidence of resolution efforts by Applicant, I conclude 
that the accounts have not been resolved.  
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): This refers to an unspecified type of education-related account with 
an unpaid balance of $253 that was placed for collection.25 Applicant claimed that the 
account had been paid in November 2015, before the SOR was issued.26 On an 
                                                          
 
17 GE 2, supra note 5, at 8, 12. It should be noted that a “factoring company” is a company that buys “accounts 
receivable” from a current creditor and then collects on those receivables from the debtor. A factored account is not 
supposed to be an account that is in collection or charged off.

unspecified date, the collection agent issued a paid in full letter.27 The account has been 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): This refers to a nutrition company account with an unpaid balance of 
$62 that was placed for collection in 2011.28 Applicant claimed that his wife opened the 
account in his name without his knowledge after they separated.29 On January 5, 2016 – 
nearly three months before the SOR was issued – Applicant paid the collection agent, 
and that agent considers the account paid in full.30 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): This refers to a medical account with an estimated unpaid balance of 
$3,000 that arose in August 2010. The charges were associated with a motorcycle 
accident when a vehicle driven by an unknown driver ran Applicant off the road and fled 
the scene. Applicant did not have health insurance at the time and had insufficient funds 
to pay the hospital charges.31 In his e-QIP, Applicant said he had attempted to resolve 
the account by contacting the creditor, but he was unable to do so because all he got was 
“the run around.”32 During his OPM interview, Applicant estimated the unpaid balance.33 
In his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that the $3,000 was still unpaid.34 However, during 
the hearing, Applicant disputed that estimate, and he questioned if there was any medical 
record to support the existence of an unpaid balance.35 Although offered the opportunity 
to give some closure to the allegation, Applicant failed to submit any documentation to 
support his contentions that the account had been resolved or that he had been cleared 
of responsibility for it. The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.m.): This refers to Applicant’s state-mandated child support of $696.40 
each month for the noncustodial support of his three daughters.36 Although there is 
documentation reflecting that amount, Applicant testified that he actually pays $710 plus 
$119 for arrearage each month for the three older children to his ex-wife, plus $700 to the 
mother of his youngest child.37 Applicant acknowledged that during periods of 
unemployment, he sometimes failed to make full monthly payments because he had

insufficient funds to do so.38 In 2014, Applicant’s ex-wife deposited the children with him 
at his mother’s residence (where he too was residing), and she left town to avoid an arrest 
warrant for a period initially estimated to be four months, but later described as nearly 
one year.39 During the period the children resided with him, he did not pay any child 
support.40 Applicant went to court to obtain physical custody of his children when his ex-
wife returned, but the court refused to order the change. Applicant was not ordered to pay 
any child custody covering the period during which the children resided with him.41 
Because of the way the allegation was framed, it merely alleges that Applicant failed to 
pay the state-mandated child support on multiple occasions, but there is no allegation 
that Applicant has failed to take steps to resolve the account as of the date of the SOR. 
The account is in the process of being resolved. 
During the hearing, Applicant testified that he had an estimated monthly net 
income of $4,000; and $3,214 in monthly expenses.42 That would leave an estimated 
monthly remainder of $786 available for discretionary saving or spending. On July 25, 
2016, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement that partially modified his 
earlier testimony. He recalculated his net monthly income as between $3,000 and $4,500, 
depending on his company travel requirements; added a monthly $100 student loan 
expense; and stated his child support payments totaled $1,500 rather than his earlier 
described $1,529.43 Those new figures might substantially alter his monthly remainder, 
especially during periods when his net monthly income was on the low estimate of $3,000. 
He indicated he had $500 in savings and an unspecified amount in his 401(k) retirement 
account. He maintains a mental budget rather than a written one.44 He has no other 
delinquent accounts.45 Applicant has made substantial progress in resolving his 
delinquent accounts. It appears that Applicant’s financial status has improved 
significantly, and that his financial problems are finally under control.  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”46 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to

determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”47   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”48 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.49  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather

a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.

than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”50 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”51 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose in 2008, and increased during the 
ensuing years. Accounts became delinquent and some were placed for collection. A 
judgment was filed. A vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person

has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”52 In addition, 
AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by his personal frivolous or irresponsible spending. In addition, it does 
not appear that he spent beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems arose at about 
the time he and his wife separated, and they continued beyond their eventual divorce. 
Some of those financial problems were attributed to a variety of combined factors that 
were largely beyond Applicant=s control: periods of unemployment; confusion over the 
legal responsibility of certain debts because of the similarity of names with his father; a 
difficult marriage, separation, and contentious divorce; child custody litigation, paternity 
test fees; as well as some activities by his ex-wife. Unexpected expenses as well as his 
wife’s failed promises to be responsible for some of the marital debts significantly affected 
his financial stability, causing him to miss some monthly payments. 
 
 Applicant commenced his task of resolving his debts, limited largely by an inability 
to generate the funds to do so more expeditiously. He reached out to his creditors and, 
where possible, he negotiated settlements or paid accounts in full. He facilitated the 
repossession of a vehicle his wife had hidden, and resolved the judgment in 2012, over 
four years before the SOR was issued.  He successfully disputed some accounts. Of the 
13 SOR-related accounts, he either resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all but five 
accounts, and some of those are in doubt only because Applicant was unable to furnish 
supporting documentation. While he never received financial counseling, he did engage 
the professional services of a credit repair company. There are no other delinquent debts. 
Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly. His ex-wife no longer has a direct 
negative impact on his finances. His financial problems are finally under control. He 
appears to have acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the 
                                                          
52 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

circumstances confronting him, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.53 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.54       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain his normal monthly payments to a number of his accounts, and, over multi-year 
period, a number of accounts became delinquent, and they were placed for collection. A 
vehicle was repossessed.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant’s financial problems were 
attributed to a variety of combined factors that were largely beyond Applicant=s control. 
Without the financial resources to maintain his accounts in a current status, they became 
delinquent. As early as 2012, years before the SOR was issued, he contacted his 
creditors and collection agents to resolve them. He has nearly completed his task as all 
but a few of the accounts have been resolved. Applicant followed through on his promises 
to address his debts.55

Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
55 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 56 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was issued. He keeps 
track of his expenses and maintains a budget. This decision should serve as a warning 
that Applicant’s failure to continue his resolution efforts with respect to his unresolved 
debts, or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect his future 
eligibility for a security clearance.57 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG 
¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
                                                          
 
56 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
57 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. DOHA has no authority to attach limiting conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR 
Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See 
also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006);

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
