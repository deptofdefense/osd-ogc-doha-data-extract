FOR GOVERNMENT
Kathryn D. MacKinnon, Esq., Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Sheldon I. Cohen, Esq.
SYNOPSIS
Applicant is employed by a federal contractor.  He is a naturalized citizen, having immigrated
from Israel.  He is divorced.  He has two children that are U.S. citizens, one by birth, the other by
naturalization.  He is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.  He has an expired Israeli passport and he
is willing to renounce his dual citizenship.  He has mitigated security concerns about foreign
preference.  Using the “whole person concept,” he successfully mitigated security concerns about
foreign influence. Clearance is granted.

Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR alleged reasons
under Guidelines C (foreign preference) and B (foreign influence) and detailed why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance.
In a written statement dated October 14, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the
SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2005.  A Notice of Hearing
was issued June 9, 2005, scheduling the hearing for June 29, 2005.  On June 24, 2005, Applicant
retained new counsel who requested a continuance.  I granted the motion.  On September 15, 2005,
a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the hearing for October 24, 2005.  On October 21, 2005, both
parties requested a continuance.  That same day I granted the motion and set the hearing for
November 14, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  At the hearing, the government offered
eight exhibits and asked for administrative notice of eight additional exhibits.  I sustained objections
to administrative exhibits 3 and 7.  Applicant submitted forty-two exhibits.  I sustained objections
to Applicant’s Exhibits G-N, W-Z, AA, CC, and DD1-DD4.   He requested I take administrative1
notice of Appeal Board case No. 02-26978, September 21, 2005, which was granted.   Applicant2
called two witnesses and he testified in his own behalf.  Applicant’s third witness was unavoidably
detained and I recessed the hearing until November 28, 2005.   On that date Applicant called one3
witness and the record was closed.  The transcript (Tr.) was received December 1, 2005, and
December 8, 2005.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted  the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 2.d. and 2.e.  All other allegations
were denied.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 66-year-old employee of a federal contractor.   From 1957 to 1960 he served4
in the Israeli army as military service was compulsory.   He immigrated to the U.S. from Israel in5
1968 to complete work on a Ph.D. in systems engineering.   After 1968, he never voted in Israeli6
elections, never ran for office, never worked for the Israeli government, never received any financial

benefits from the government of Israel, paid no taxes to Israel, and owned no property in Israel.   He7
became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1982.   He had been married to an Israeli citizen and was8
divorced in 1986.  He has not remarried.   He raised two daughters, one born in Israel and now a9
naturalized U.S. citizen and the other born in the U.S.   He has little contact with his former wife.10 11
   
Applicant has two brothers and a sister who are citizens and residents of Israel.   One brother12
was a general officer in the Israel Air Force, then headed the Israeli equivalent of the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration, and is now retired.   He talks by phone with his brother 3-4 times per year13
and emails him about the same frequency.   He last saw his family in Israel in 1998 when he14
traveled there for their mother’s funeral.   His brother came to the U.S. to visit him in 2000, when15
he had heart surgery.16
Another of Applicant’s brothers is a bus driver and tour guide, with no connection to the
Israeli government.   He talks with this brother by phone 3-4 times per year.   His brother never17 18
inquires about Applicant’s work nor has he ever asked him for any classified information.   This19
brother and his wife came to the U.S. to visit in 1999.20
His sister is a retired teacher, and he has telephone contact with her the same as with his
brothers, 3-4 times per year.  He only discusses family matters with her, and she has never asked him
about his work.   21

Allegation 2.d. of the SOR alleges he has a friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel.
During one of his trips to Israel, he met a lady who worked at an Israeli university.  They dated
socially and were considering marriage.  She wished to remain in Israel, however,  because both of
her parents were living.  Applicant did not want to move to Israel and the relationship ended more
than two years ago.  She never inquired about his employment.  He no longer has contact with her.22
Applicant traveled to Israel three times in 1995, once in 1996 or 1997, and in 1998 for his
mother’s funeral.   His father died in 1985, but Applicant did not attend the funeral because of his23
pending divorce.   Since 1998, there also have been two family weddings and the funerals for a24
sister-in-law and a brother-in-law which he did not attend.   Each time he has traveled to Israel he25
used his Israeli passport because the government of Israel requires persons with dual citizenship to
possess and use an Israeli passport.   On one trip he forgot his Israeli passport and was allowed into26
the country using his U.S. passport, but he was warned that it would not be allowed in the future.27
He has never been asked by anyone in Israel what his work entailed or for other such information.28
Around 1979, Applicant worked for a different contractor who had a job with an Israeli
government contractor.  He was assigned to assist because he spoke Hebrew and could communicate
with the Israeli employees.   A contract dispute arose between his company and the Israeli29
government that had nothing to do with Applicant’s work.  He defended his company in negotiations
between Israel and his employer.   30
Applicant applied for and was issued an Israeli passport in November 2001, and it expired
in November 2002.  It has not been renewed.  He obtained this passport because of illness in his
Israeli family and he thought about visiting them.   31

The Money Memorandum  clarifies policy with respect to denial of security clearances if32
one holds an active foreign passport. Applicant was unaware of this policy until October 2004, when
he received a copy of the Memorandum with the SOR.   He is willing to surrender his expired Israeli33
passport, but he cannot find it or his U.S. passport.   In the past he signed statements indicating he34
might renew his passport.   With his understanding of the Money Memorandum, he is willing to35
surrender his Israeli passport and does not intend to renew it.   He would side with the U.S. if36
diplomatic ties between Israel and the U.S. were to be broken,  but would not bear arms against37
Israel.   At age 66 and with a history of heart surgery, it is most unlikely he would be asked to bear38
arms against any country.   If a family member were to be held hostage or a foreign government39
asked him for classified information, he would contact the appropriate U.S. security authorities.40
If Applicant were to travel to Israel in the future, he would request permission from the Israeli
Embassy to travel as an American on a U.S. passport.41
Applicant commenced proceedings to obtain a security clearance in 1984, but abandoned the
request when he changed employment.42
In describing Applicant, the president of his company used terms such as “good-hearted,
quiet, does his work, true gentleman, contributes to company social events, professional, honest, and
quality work.”   His immediate supervisor used terms such as “committed, dedicated, reliable,43
strong work ethic, thorough, accurate, and no question of his honesty and integrity” in describing
Applicant.   A final witness was Applicant’s Ph.D. thesis adviser.  Applicant and he have stayed in44
touch since university days, have written joint papers, collaborated on projects together, and have

become good friends.  He believes Applicant to be honest and a person of the very highest integrity.45
All recommend Applicant for a security clearance.46
Israel is a multiparty parliamentary democracy with an independent judiciary.   The47
government generally respects human rights except there are some cases of discrimination primarily
towards Arabs living in Israel.   The U.S. and Israel have maintained close and supportive relations48
since President Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel in May 1948, moments after Israel
declared its independence.   The U.S. gives Israel about $3 billion per year in economic and military49
aid.50
The government asked for administrative notice of Israeli espionage activities.  The exhibit
was admitted over objection.   In 1985 and 1986, there were five incidents involving espionage and51
classified information being given to Israel.  Israel denied any part in the espionage activities or
claimed the operations were being run by renegade agents.  Th exhibit did not identify any activity52
by the Israeli government in espionage activities against the United States.53
POLICIES
“[No] one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”   As Commander-in-Chief, the President has54
“the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such

information.”   The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United55
States citizens “whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United
States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as
well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information.”   Eligibility56
for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
factors listed in ¶ 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that
the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information.   The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection57
between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an
applicant’s security suitability.58
Once the Government establishes its case, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is59
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”   A person60
who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government
based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each
applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect
the national interests as his or his own.  The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the
Government.   Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible61
risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not actual,
risk of compromise of classified information.
Money Memorandum, supra, at 1. 62
Id. 63

Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section
7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant
concerned.”  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than
allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. 
Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent
to an evaluation of the facts of this case: 
Guideline C (foreign preference) 
E2.A3.1.1.The Concern: (When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a
foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States).
Guideline B (foreign influence) 
E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: (A security risk may exist when an individual’s immediate family, including
cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or
obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations
could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are
also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to
coercion, exploitation, or pressure).
CONCLUSIONS
Foreign Preference
The Government has established its case under Guideline C by showing that Applicant
exercised dual citizenship with Israel, possessed and used an Israeli passport, and served in the Israeli
Army.  Therefore, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. (The exercise
of dual citizenship), E2.A3.1.2.2. (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport), and  E2.A3.1.2.3.
(Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country) are applicable.
  
The Money Memorandum  of August 16, 2000, clarifies DoD policy regarding the62
possession and/or use of foreign passports. It requires that “any clearance be denied or revoked
unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the
appropriate agency of the United States Government.”   Under the Money Memorandum, possession63
and/or use of a foreign passport is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety,
requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  Applicant’s Israeli passport

expired in 2002, and he does not intend to renew it. Further, he lost this passport which is the
functional equivalent of destroying it.  Therefore, the Money Memorandum does not apply.
Applicant is a citizen of Israel because he was born there.  Foreign Preference Mitigating
Condition  E2.A3.1.3.1. (Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign
country) is applicable. .  
 In as much as Applicant’s mandatory service in the Israeli Army ended eight years before
he immigrated to the U. S., Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.2.(Indicators of
possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States
citizenship) applies.
Applicant expressed his willingness to renounce his Israeli citizenship  in his testimony and
in his amended response to the SOR.  Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4.
(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) is applicable. 
 
Applicant’s passport expired in November 2002.  He has no intention of renewing it.
Accordingly, I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline C.
Foreign Influence
A security risk may exist when an applicant’s immediate family, or other persons to whom
he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U. S., or may be
subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result
in the compromise of classified information. 
The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant’s two brothers and
a sister are citizens and residents of Israel.  Therefore, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions
(FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close
ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) and FI DC
E2.A2.1.2.3. (Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government)
both apply.  
Under the Directive, potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated through the
application of the “whole person” concept and specific mitigating conditions.  When the Government
produces evidence raising potentially disqualifying conditions, an Applicant has the burden to
produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.   The government never64
has the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.65
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. provides (A determination that
the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters),
cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be

exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to
the person(s) involved and the United States).  Applicants must establish: (1) that the individuals in
question are not “agents of a foreign power,” and (2) that they are not in a position to be exploited
by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved
and the United States.66
Applicant’s brothers and sister do not meet the definition of “agent of a foreign power” under
50 U.S.C. § 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. § 1801(b).  Similarly, they would not be considered as an “agent
of a foreign power” under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The
available evidence indicates his brothers and sister have no ties to or economic dependence upon the
Israeli government.  His relationship with a person living in Israel ended over two years’ ago and he
has no contact with her. 
The second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are “in a position to be
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to
the person(s) involved and the United States.”   The federal statute, 50 U.S.C. § 1801(a), defines67
“foreign power” to include: a foreign government; a faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly
acknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign government; a group engaged
in international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or an entity directed and controlled
by a foreign government. 
To determine whether Applicant was “in a position to be exploited by a foreign power,” I
must examine Applicant’s connection to his family in the foreign country.  His family residing in
Israel present somewhat of a  vulnerability; although they have no connection to or dependence upon
a foreign power, they are still under the physical control of the Israeli government.  Applicant’s
record of successful employment, the fact that Israel and the U.S. enjoy a good relationship, that the
Israeli government respects human rights, and Israel’s dependence on the U.S. for military and
economic aid make it unlikely that he would be vulnerable to improper influence through his
relatives in Israel.
However, as discussed above, in order to apply the second prong of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the
Appeal Board requires that applicants affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone
would attempt to exploit a foreign relative in the future.  Also, the Appeal Board prohibits any
consideration of evidence that is not dispositive of the issue.  Finally, the Appeal Board finds it
irrelevant to this issue whether an applicant is likely to be improperly influenced by a foreign relative
or associate.  Applying that standard, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. does not apply.
The “whole person” concept – not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions – is
the heart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the68
ISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29,69

Directive, ¶ E2.2.1.8.73
11
Appeal Board has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant
where no specific mitigating conditions apply.69
In assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates
in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  “Although the position of an
applicant’s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the favorable application of FI
MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic
potential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable application of the relevant general factors.”70
One of the “whole person” factors which must be considered is “the potential for pressure,
coercion, exploitation, or duress.”   First must be considered the character of the foreign power in71
question, including the government and entities controlled by the government within the country.
A friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that  Israel would attempt
to exploit a U.S. citizen through his relatives or associates.72
It is also helpful to consider Applicant’s relatives’ vulnerability to exploitation by foreign
powers in Israel.  While Applicant’s three siblings live in Israel they may not be more vulnerable to
the Israeli government.  While it may be argued that his brother who is a retired general officer in
the Israeli Air Force could be a direct conduit of information from Applicant to the government of
Israel, it is just as conceivable that because of his brother’s standing with the government, his family
is less likely to suffer harm.
Most importantly, it is necessary to consider Applicant’s vulnerability to exploitation through
his relatives.  Applicant is a mature individual with almost thirty-five years of successful
employment in this country. He is a U.S. citizen as are his children.  He was educated in this country.
Applicant has strong ties to the United States.  Because of Applicant’s deep and long-standing
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor
of the United States.  Further because of Israel’s financial and military dependance on the U.S., I find
the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.73
Applicant has no assets in Israel.  FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (Foreign financial interests are
minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities) applies.
12
If a suggestion is made that Applicant might divulge classified information to his brother, it
is not a plausible argument.  Applicant has waited 38 years since immigrating to this country, at the
age of 66, and after heart surgery, to apply for a clearance.
I carefully evaluated the “whole person” concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved
in favor of the national security.  I considered Applicant’s demeanor while testifying and considered
his credibility.  He has a reputation for honesty, integrity, and good work ethic.  I conclude Applicant
has mitigated the potential security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence.
