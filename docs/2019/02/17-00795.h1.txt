Decision 
______________ 
HESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: 
While Applicant’s financial difficulties arose from circumstances largely beyond his 
control, he failed to act reasonably under the circumstances and did not mitigate the 
security concerns raised by his finances. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 25, 2016. 
On April 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The 
DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 
2006.  
Applicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on May 9, 2017, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
02/08/2019
2 
 
June 22, 2017, and the case was originally scheduled for hearing with another 
administrative judge on March 6, 2018. The hearing was subsequently canceled and the 
case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 20, 2018, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant, through counsel, that the hearing was 
scheduled for June 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits 
(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through WW, which were admitted without 
objection, and called five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2018.  
  
The SOR was issued under the AG implemented on September 1, 2006. The DOD 
implemented the amended AG on June 8, 2017, while this decision was pending. This 
decision is based on the amended AG effective June 8, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant, 46, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor 
since January 2014. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1994 until he 
retired in March 2014. His service included three combat tours, and he received 
numerous metals and commendations, including a Bronze Star for meritorious service. 
He and his current wife married in 2001. They have four adult children and twins in high 
school. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in 1994. (GX 1; AX A; AX II 
through WW; Tr. 14.)  
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges four debts totaling $36,884 and a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy discharged in 2006. Applicant admits each of these allegations. The 
delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s February 2017 and April 2016 credit bureau 
reports (CBR) and discussed during his September 2016 personal subject interview (PSI). 
(GX 5; GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. 
 
Prior to their marriage and 2001, both Applicant and his wife individually filed 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 59.) The bankruptcies were discharged in 2006. (GX 3.) 
Applicant and his wife struggled financially early in their marriage, in part because they 
were both active duty and not earning significant salaries, and because of the size of their 
household. (Tr. 20.) However, Applicant was promoted and their finances had otherwise 
stabilized, so Applicant purchased a boat for $28,694 in April 2008. (GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 35; 
Tr. 65.) 
 
 Both Applicant and his wife testified that Applicant’s wife is responsible for 
managing the household finances. (Tr. 45; Tr. 60.) Applicant attributes his financial 
difficulties to the combined impact of several events in 2011. Applicant’s wife was eligible 
to retire from the military in 2011. They reviewed their finances and determined that if 
Applicant deployed, he would receive greater pay and his wife could retire. She retired in 
May 2011. Applicant’s wife was approved for 80% disability compensation upon 
retirement, but did not start receiving payments until approximately May 2012. Applicant’s 
wife’s reduced income and delayed disability compensation created greater financial 
strains on the household. (Tr. 59-60.) 
3 
 
Additionally, the vehicle Applicant’s wife was driving during this time had major 
engine trouble that required repairs that cost $7,000 to $9,000. (Tr. 52; Tr. 27.) Despite 
the fact that Applicant had purchased an extended warranty for the vehicle, the dealership 
would not honor the warranty. The vehicle underwent several repair attempts, but never 
ran properly, and eventually became inoperable. At some point, Applicant stopped 
making payments, and the vehicle was ultimately repossessed. (Tr. 26-28.) The $7,241 
balance (SOR ¶ 1.b) was charged-off in March 2012. (GX 4.) 
 
In September 2011, Applicant’s son was in an accident that resulted in third-degree 
burns and had to be airlifted to a hospital in another city for medical treatment. Applicant 
was deployed and his wife had to travel several hours from their home to see their son in 
the hospital. This resulted in travel-related and childcare costs as well as medical bills. 
(Tr. 50; GX 2.) 
 
Due to the increased financial stressors, Applicant fell behind on his monthly 
obligations, including his monthly boat payments of approximately $500. Applicant 
attempted to negotiate with the creditor, but the creditor demanded a full lump-sum 
payment. Applicant’s last payment on the boat was in September 2011, and the boat was 
later voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 36-37; GX 4.) Applicant believes the boat was sold at 
auction. The creditor charged-off the $28,694 original loan amount (SOR ¶ 1.c) in June 
2014. (GX 4.) Applicant’s wife testified that the creditor sent Applicant letters attempting 
to collect the debt, but because they did not have the money to pay the debt, she did not 
respond. (Tr. 70.) She further stated that between 2012 and 2016 she “did not make any 
effort to pay the debts . . . we did start making more money in 2014, but honestly it had 
been so long that I didn’t make any effort to pay those.” (Tr. 74.) 
 
Applicant discussed his delinquent accounts with the investigator during his PSI in 
September 2016. At that time, Applicant stated that he did not know the status of the 
$7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) or the $28,694 repossessed-boat debt 
(SOR ¶ 1.d) and had not had any contact with the creditors. The investigator confronted 
Applicant with several other delinquent accounts including the $605 credit-card debt 
(SOR ¶ 1.c) and the $344 cellular telephone debt (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant was unaware of 
these debts but stated that he would consult his wife, and if the debts were valid, he would 
attempt to resolve them within the next 30 days. (GX 2.) In his Answer, Applicant stated 
that, “now that we are financially able and I am aware of the repercussions, I intend to 
pay these debts.”   
 
Applicant testified that the first time he recalls being aware of his delinquent debts 
was in 2016 when reviewing his CBR with the mortgage broker. (Tr. 51-52.) He further 
testified that the mortgage broker advised Applicant not to contact the creditors of or to 
make payments on the outstanding $7,241 repossessed-vehicle debt or the $28,694 
repossessed-boat debt. Applicant explained that the mortgage broker stated that the 
debts were old, but any activity on the accounts could reactivate them, which could result 
in a negative impact on Applicant’s credit and ability to qualify for a favorable interest rate. 
(Tr. 52-53.) Applicant also stated that the mortgage broker told him that paying the 
delinquent accounts would result in Applicant’s not being “able  to  purchase  the  home 
4 
 
because  our  credit  rating  would drop.” (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant opted not to contact the 
creditors. (Tr. 37.)  
 
Applicant received an IRS 1099 C Forgiveness of Debt Form in 2017, and paid the 
required tax. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his wife specifically recognize the $605 credit-
card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 39; Tr. 69.) The debt was charged off in September 
2010. The $344 delinquent cellular telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.e) was last paid in 
September 2009 and transferred to collection in November 2011. (GX 5.) In December 
2017 or January 2018, when the initial hearing was pending, Applicant was concerned 
about any remaining delinquent accounts. He contacted the creditors of these two 
accounts and paid them by telephone. (Tr. 39.) SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e have been 
resolved. 
 
 Applicant’s four character witnesses, all of whom hold security clearances and 
know Applicant professionally and personally, have served with or worked with Applicant. 
The witnesses collectively testified to the strength of Applicant’s character, stating that 
Applicant had an outstanding reputation of integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, and 
dedication. (Tr. 75-93.) Applicant’s 1997 to 2013 military evaluation reports are positive, 
and his service school academic evaluations show that he met or exceeded course 
standards. (AX I through FF.) He received the following awards for his military service: 
Army Achievement medal 1996, 1999, 2000; Armed Forces Expeditionary medal 1996; 
Good Conduct medal 1997, 2003, 2005; Army Commendation medal 2003, 2004, 2008, 
2010; Bronze Star medal 2008; and Meritorious Service medal 2013. Applicant’s 2014 to 
2017 employee performance reviews show that Applicant met or exceeded performance 
expectations and that Applicant was a valuable team member and a key asset to the 
programs on which he has worked. (AX E through AX H.) 
  
Applicant’s current monthly net income is $4,400, and he and his wife both receive 
military retirement and disability compensation payments. Their net monthly household 
income is approximately $11,100. (Tr. 41-43.) Applicant and his wife both testified that 
they are currently in a good financial position. (Tr. 41; Tr. 67.) Applicant purchased a 
house in July 2016 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage-loan of 3.75%.1 (Tr. 31.) His 
monthly loan payment as of December 2016 was $2,108. (GX 5.) Applicant did not submit 
a written budget, nor is there any reference to maintaining a budget in Applicant’s or his 
wife’s testimony. Applicant contributes $2,000 a month to his 401(k) and pays $6,000 
annually for additional medical insurance. Applicant testified that he does not have any 
other delinquent accounts. (Tr. 48.) There is no other record evidence regarding 
Applicant’s financial obligations. Neither of the parties submitted a current credit bureau 
report. Applicant has not taken any action to dispute his debts with credit reporting 
agencies. (Tr, 45-46.) Applicant does not have a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent 
debt.

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant’s meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 
1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  
  
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
6 
 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. 
  
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
   
The record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s financial difficulties began in 2011 due to several events that were 
largely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant’s son was severely injured in an 
accident, Applicant’s wife’s income decreased, and Applicant’s vehicle required costly 
repairs. The financial strain caused by these events resulted in Applicant’s inability to 
maintain his financial obligations. However, Applicant has not acted reasonably in 
resolving his debts. Applicant has been aware of his delinquent accounts since 2016. On 
the advice of his mortgage broker, Applicant took no action to satisfy his delinquent 
accounts because he was concerned he would not qualify for a mortgage loan. Applicant 
secured a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan in 2016, but did not subsequently take any 
steps to resolve his delinquent accounts. Applicant paid SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e, totaling 
$949 in December 2017 or January 2018 because he was concerned about the impact 
of delinquent accounts on his security clearance. The $7,241 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b 
was resolved by the creditor’s forgiveness of the debt, not by any affirmative action taken 
by Applicant. The $28,694 charged-off debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d remains unresolved and 
Applicant does not have a plan to pay it. 
 
 The appeal board has regularly held that “applicants who only begin to address 
their security-significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking 
in judgment and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 
2017.)  
  
 Although Applicant does not have any recent delinquent accounts, his failure to 
resolve his delinquent debt casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. Additionally, Applicant acted in his own personal interests in securing a 
mortgage ahead of his legal obligation to satisfy his debts. His eleventh-hour payment of 
two SOR debts and the creditor’s forgiveness of a third does not constitute a good-faith 
effort to resolve his debts. “Good faith” means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). There is no evidence that Applicant has 
participated in financial counseling, and he does not have a plan to resolve his remaining 
delinquent account. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant’s 2001 Chapter 13 
bankruptcy does not create any current security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
8 
 
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
  
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I have also 
considered the following: 
  
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, including 
three combat deployments, during which time he received multiple accolades for his 
service. He has held a security clearance for more than 30 years. He is considered to be 
trustworthy and is respected by his colleagues and friends. However, while he has not 
incurred any significant recent delinquent debt, the unresolved delinquent SOR debt 
remains a concern.  
  
 After weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. 
Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
 
Formal Findings 
 
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
  
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.b – 1.e:    Against Applicant 
 
   
 
9 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to 
grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
