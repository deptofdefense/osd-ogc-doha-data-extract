______________ 
FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on (SCA) March 7, 2016. On 
March 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline 
F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines
(December 10, 2016).
Applicant answered the SOR on August 22, 2018, and requested a decision on the 
written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written 
case on August 30, 2018. On September 4, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant 
02/01/2019
 
2 
 
material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. The 
FORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on February 
10 and 24, 2017, and November 1, 2017. The PSI summaries were not authenticated as 
required by Directive ¶ E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was 
entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summaries, make any corrections, 
additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summaries on the 
ground that they were not authenticated. Applicant received the FORM on September 12, 
2018, and did not respond. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries 
by failing to respond to the FORM. “Although pro se applicants are not expected to act 
like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights 
under the Directive.” ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016).The case 
was assigned to me on January 17, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR ¶ 
1.h, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 43-year-old solution developer employed by a federal contractor 
since January 2015. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 1999 and a master’s degree 
in May 2004. He worked as a software developer for a private-sector employer from 
January 2006 to November 2011, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from 
November 2011 to January 2013. He was self-employed from January 2013 to January 
2015, when he accepted his current position. He has never held a security clearance. 
 
Applicant has never married and has no children. He provided no information about 
his income and expenses while self-employed or since his current employment in January 
2015.  
 
 The SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $443,600. It includes seven 
default judgments totaling about $330,206, of which six are unsatisfied. The court records 
reflect that the default judgments were entered after notices were sent to the addresses 
for Applicant’s rental properties, posted on the rental properties, sent to his mother’s 
home, where he lived from 2006-2009, sent to his residence from 2009-2015, sent to 
Applicant’s post office box, and served by publication. (FORM Items 7-13.)  
 
Many of the debts are related to Applicant’s investments in rental properties. The 
debts are reflected in court records (FORM Items 7-13) and credit reports from October 
2015 (FORM Item 5) and December 2017 (FORM Item 6.) The evidence concerning the 
debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
  
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 3) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 SOR ¶ 1.a: judgment for $10,115, filed in November 2010. This is a default 
judgment for a delinquent credit-card account. (FORM Item 7.) During the February 2017 
PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he was unable to pay this debt because he was 
unemployed at the time and had other financial obligations. (FORM Item 4 at 9.) The debt 
is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: judgment for $44,999, filed in November 2011. This is a default 
judgment for a delinquent mortgage loan on a rental property. The October 2016 credit 
report reflects that the property was sold after foreclosure and the debt has a zero 
balance. (FORM Item 5 at 6.) This judgment is satisfied. 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.g: judgments for $60,981, filed in February 2012; $42,547, filed 
in August 2013; $35,081, filed in August 2013; $42,200, filed in January 2015; and 
$94,283, filed in June 2015. These are default judgments for delinquent mortgage loans 
on rental properties. Applicant attributed these delinquencies to his unemployment from 
November 2011 to January 2013 and inability to find renters for his properties. (FORM 
Item 4 at 10-11.) In Applicant’s SCA, he stated that the lender foreclosed on the property 
in SOR ¶ 1.f (judgment for $42,200), but he submitted no evidence to support his 
statement. (GX 3 at 45.) These judgments are not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: collection account for $23,836. The credit report from May 2016 
reflects that this debt is a delinquent student loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM 
Item 5 at 3-4.) In the February 2017 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he fell behind 
on his payments because he was laid off. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11.) The debt is not 
resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: line of credit charged off for $9,479. In the February 2017 PSI, 
Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was 
charged off. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) This debt is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j: collection account for $1,129. This debt is not reflected on the credit 
reports in the record. This allegation is not supported by the evidence. 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.u: utility bills placed for collection of $364, 
$292, $88, and $73 (two bills). These debts were incurred when Applicant’s tenants 
failed to transfer the accounts to their names or failed to pay the bills. (FORM Item 3 at 
44; Form Item 4 at 12-14.) They are not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l: collection account for $35,706. This debt is a delinquent credit-card 
account. It is not resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m: collection account for $32,575. This debt is a delinquent student 
loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM Item 5 at 3.) It is not resolved. 
 
 
4 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.n: credit-card account charged off for $8,605. In the February 2017 
PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was 
charged off. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o: debt to credit union charged off for $285. This debt is an overdraft 
charge. (FORM Item 4 at 13.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p: credit-card account placed for collection of $916. In the February 
2017 PSI, Applicant acknowledged this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.t: telecommunications account placed for collection of $49. This debt 
is reflected in the October 2016 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) In the February 2017 
PSI, Applicant was unable to identify this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 15.) It is not resolved. 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he asserted that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.h and 1.i were duplicates. It is unclear whether the same lending institution is involved 
in both debts. However, the evidence shows that the debts are not duplicates. The debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is a student loan, and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is a line of credit.  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
 
5 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
 
6 
 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the 
following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy 
debts; AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. The following mitigating 
conditions are potentially applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous and 
recent. The debts related to Applicant’s rental properties (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g, 1.1, 1.r, 1.s, 
and 1.u) were incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, because it is 
unlikely that Applicant will again venture as deeply into multiple rental-property 
investments as he has done in the past. The other debts alleged in the SOR were not 
incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s unemployment, his inability to keep 
his properties rented, and the failures of his tenants to pay their utility bills were conditions 
largely beyond his control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has been gainfully 
employed for four years. He was aware of many delinquent debts when he submitted his 
SCA in March 2016, and he was questioned about his delinquent debts during the 
 
7 
 
February 2017 PSI. However, he submitted no evidence of efforts to renegotiate, 
compromise, settle, or otherwise resolve any of his debts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial 
counseling, and his financial problems are not under control. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. The judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was resolved 
by foreclosure and the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.m were or are being 
resolved by garnishment. However, these involuntary measures do not constitute good-
faith efforts within the meaning of this mitigating condition. Payments by involuntary 
garnishment are “not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the 
debtor.” ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-
06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Applicant has submitted no evidence of payments or 
payment agreements regarding the other delinquencies alleged in the SOR. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant asserted that the debts alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i are duplicates, he submitted no evidence that he has disputed any 
of the debts with the original creditors, collection agencies, or credit bureaus. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Because Applicant requested a 
determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his 
credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. 
Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. 
 
  
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.b:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.g:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.j:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.k-1.u:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
