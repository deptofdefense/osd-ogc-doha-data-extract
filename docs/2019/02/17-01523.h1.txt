Decision 
___________ 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
2012 through 2015, in part, because of problems with her spouse, allocation of 
deductions, and lack of understanding of the tax-filing process. She is credited with filing 
most of her overdue tax returns and paying all of her established tax debts and other 
delinquent debts. However, proof of filing of all overdue tax returns is necessary to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.      
History of the Case 
On March 7, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On June 30, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 
20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing 
in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance

for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On August 22, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On September 19, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
February 16, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On April 4, 2018, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for April 16, 
2018. (HE 1) Applicant waived her right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location 
of the hearing. (Tr. 12-14) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered three exhibits; there 
were no objections to the documents; and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 
16-19; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-C)) On April 25, 2018, DOHA received a copy 
of the transcript of the hearing. I received 18 exhibits after the hearing, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection. (AE D-AE V) The record closed on February 20, 
2019. (AE W)   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.i, and she denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k. (HE 3) She also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.  
 
Applicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in 
workforce planning since 2016. (Tr. 5, 8, 35; GE 1) In 1999, she graduated from high 
school; in 1996, she received a bachelor’s degree; and in 2001, she received a master’s 
degree in business administration. (Tr. 5, 7) She has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 
2001, she married, and in 2012, she separated from her spouse. (Tr. 6, 20) Her twins are 
age 11, and her other child is 12. (Tr. 7) She has custody of her three children, and her 
husband is living outside of the United States. (Tr. 29) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant gave her financial information to her husband’s father who was supposed 
to file her income tax returns. (Tr. 21) When her father-in-law filed the tax returns, he filed 
married separate, and he allocated the deductions to her husband. (Tr. 21, 42-43; GE 1) 
When she received correspondence from the IRS, she gave the documentation to her 
father-in-law, and she believed he was handling filing of necessary tax returns for her in 
good faith. (Tr. 22) She believed her husband was going to pay her share of the taxes 
because he was using the deductions. (Tr. 23; GE 1) She believed that the tax lien was 
a marital debt, and thus, her husband was responsible for half of the debt. (Tr. 24) 
Applicant’s husband was arrested on multiple occasions for domestic violence, and on 
one occasion, he knocked out some of Applicant’s teeth. (Tr. 31) She made 12 Child 
Protective Services (CPS) complaints against him, and he does not visit their children. 
(Tr. 31) When her husband left, he took the funds from their retirement accounts. (Tr. 40)

Her September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated Applicant and her husband had 
to file a consent order to have their mutual protective orders against each other dismissed. 
(AE V at 17) Applicant recently obtained a second job to enable her to pay her debts. (AE 
L) See also GE 1, Section 22 (indicating in August 2012 Applicant’s husband obtained 
her arrest for trespass, disturbing the peace, and assault). 
 
In 2012, Applicant was sick and unable to work outside her home for four months. 
(Tr. 34-35, 41; SOR response; GE 1) Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial 
issues. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i allege eight delinquent medical debts totaling 
$2,198 in the following amounts: $877; $674; $321; $121; $67; $35; $34; and $69. She 
said she paid several of the medical debts. (Tr. 31-32; AE B) Applicant paid $15,000 for 
her children’s braces. (Tr. 21) She said she just paid the debt for $877. (Tr. 31-32; AE U) 
She pays her family’s medical bills as she receives them. (Tr. 32) 
 
After her hearing, Applicant provided a printout of her healthcare claims and 
payment activity from August 2016 to January 2019. (AE U) The chart listed 
approximately 140 payments to medical creditors. Many of the payments were made 
using a credit card and the source of the claim is not indicated on the printout. Several 
substantial payments are from a health savings account. (AE U) The following table 
shows a sample of some of the payments for medical and orthodontic bills she made from 
December 2017 to January 2019.

Applicant’s September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated Applicant’s 
husband was required to maintain health insurance for Applicant and their three children 
so long as it was available at reasonable cost through his employer. (AE V at 11, 13) 
Unreimbursed medical, dental, and orthodontic expenses for each minor child were 
required to be paid in direct proportion to each party’s share of their combined gross 
income. (AE V at 12) His separation agreement required him to pay some of the other 
family bills; however, he only made sporadic payments. (Tr. 30) She has attempted to 
convince her husband to pay some of the medical debts. (AE M) Applicant acted 
 
4 
                                         
 
reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical and dental debts, and 
she mitigated SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a tax lien filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2012 
for $28,188. A copy of the tax lien is not part of the record, and it is unclear which tax year 
or years were addressed with this lien. The lien appears to be for tax years 2008 and 
2011 based on the IRS tax transcripts which show transfers of refunds to those two tax 
years. (AE F; AE G) Applicant’s September 8, 2012 separation agreement indicated 
Applicant and her husband were responsible for joint debts incurred prior to May 2012, 
and Applicant has a good faith argument that her husband is jointly responsible for half 
of her tax debts for tax years 2008 and 2011. (AE at 15)

Applicant’s tax transcript for tax year 2008 indicates that she timely filed and paid 
($32,955) to address her federal taxes for tax year 2008. (AE G) In March 2011, the IRS 
assessed $15,590 in additional taxes for tax year 2008 and over the next seven years, 
about $10,000 in penalties and interest. (AE G) Her federal income tax refunds for tax 
years 2012 ($16,262) and 2013 ($1,024) were applied to this debt. (AE G) On August 31, 
                                            
1 Applicant may have miscalculated the child and dependent care credit. She indicated $1,000 on 
lines 3 and 6 of Form 2441, instead of $6,000. (AE Q) She may be entitled to a credit of $1,200 instead of 
$200 on line 49 of Form 1040. (AE Q)

2018, she paid the IRS $4,701, and the IRS credited her with paying her tax debt on her 
tax transcript for tax year 2008. (AE G)  
 
Applicant did not owe any federal income taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, 2012, 
2013, and 2014. (Tr. 25-26; AE F) Applicant timely filed her 2011 federal income tax 
return; however, she owed about $3,500 at the time she filed her tax return. (AE F) On 
August 31, 2018, the IRS transferred a $490 credit from tax year 2008, and on October 
5, 2018, she paid $4,230, resolving her tax debt for tax year 2011. (AE F; AE G)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges Applicant failed to file or pay her federal income taxes as 
required for tax years 2012 through 2015. She said she filed her 2013 and 2014 federal 
income tax returns sometime before she responded to the SOR; however, she did not 
specify when she filed them. (Tr. 25-26; SOR response) In November 2017, Applicant 
paid the IRS $14,504. (AE C) At the time of her hearing, she had not filed her tax returns 
for tax years 2015 and 2016 because she needed information from her husband to file 
her tax returns. (Tr. 25-27) She wanted to be sure that she correctly filed all needed 
information for her tax returns. (Tr. 26-27)2 She met with a divorce lawyer in 2014; 
however, she had not seen a lawyer recently because she lacked funds to pay her lawyer. 
(Tr. 27) Her lawyer told her not to file the tax returns. (Tr. 27) Her lawyer said she needed 
to consult someone knowledgeable about taxes before doing anything. (Tr. 27-28) The 
first certified public accountant (CPA) she consulted wanted $5,000 before he would 
advise her on what she should do. (Tr. 28) Her husband said he filed his tax returns. (Tr. 
29) He is outside the country working for the U.S. Government, and he refused to give 
her information or assist her. (Tr. 29) He did not believe a court would be able to force 
him to cooperate with her because he is out of the country. (Tr. 29)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges Applicant failed to file or pay her state income taxes as required 
for tax years 2012 through 2015. 
 
On December 21, 2018, I asked Applicant to provide copies of her federal and 
state tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016.3 If the tax returns are undated, I asked 
her to disclose when they were filed. Her “final suspense” was January 25, 2019.  
 
                                            
2 The Internal Revenue Service may reject an inaccurate return. See IRS website, 
https://www.irs.gov/faqs/electronic-filing-e-file. Applicant filed her tax returns using a commercial electronic 
software program. (AE N-AE Q) Applicant attempted to file her 2015 federal income tax return on April 18, 
2016, (the date it was due) electronically; however, the IRS rejected her electronic return without specifying 
the reason(s). (AE Q) Electronic returns are not accepted by the IRS after November of the year they are 
due. (IRS website) The proper recourse after a return is rejected is to contact the IRS, and then the IRS 
may instruct the caller to file the return manually. Applicant provided a 2015 federal income tax return dated 
December 1, 2018, which was manually signed. (AE Q) When tax information is unavailable, the taxpayer 
is supposed to provide a good-faith estimate and disclose the estimation to the IRS. See American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants website, “Standards for Tax Services No. 4, Use of Estimates,”   
https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/tax/resources/standardsethics/statementsonstandardsfortaxservices/

On January 24, 2018, Applicant said she provided as attachments to emails: 
[c]opies of all my Federal and state returns. From 2012 on. I cannot get onto 
the IRS website to get the filing dates for the ones prior to 2015 because I 
changed my phone number and that's how the[y] verify. I need to have a 
new code mailed to access the online website to see my transcripts. I've 
been calling and cannot get through. I would assume that's due to the shut 
down. I'll call again in the morning. 2015 and 2016 were mailed in Dec. 
 
Applicant provided her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and 
2014, and she provided her federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. On January 
27, 2019, I asked Applicant to provide copies of her federal and state tax returns for tax 
year 2017. I also asked her to provide copies of her state tax returns for 2015 and 2016. 
I noted that many of the tax returns she previously provided are undated, and I asked her 
to disclose when they were filed.4 Her suspense to submit documentation was February 
20, 2019. I did not receive a response to my January 27, 2019 email.    
 
In November 2017, Applicant paid a credit card debt for $5,272. (AE A) On 
December 12, 2018, she sent $5,000 to the IRS to ensure the IRS had ample funds to 
address any income tax she owed. (AE L) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
                                            
4 An Applicant’s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated 
federal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 
(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). 
 
7 
                                         
 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
 
8 
                                         
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax returns as required . . . .” SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i allege and 
credit reports establish eight delinquent medical debts totaling $2,198, and she had a 
federal income tax lien entered against her for $28,188. Applicant admitted that she failed 
to timely file several state and federal tax returns. She did not provide proof that her state 
tax returns were filed as of February 20, 2019 for tax years 2015 and 2016. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Seven mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5   
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
 
9 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”

No mitigating conditions fully apply to her failure to timely file and pay her federal 
and state income taxes; however, Applicant presented some important mitigating 
information about her finances. Several circumstances that were partially or fully beyond 
her control adversely affected her finances or filing of tax returns: (1) she was ill and 
unable to work for four months in 2012; (2) she was repeatedly assaulted by her husband; 
(3) her father-in-law was supposed to file her tax returns and did not do so; (4) her 
husband did not pay his share of marital debts; (5) her husband left the United States and 
enforcement of the separation agreement was not feasible; (6) her husband did not 
provide documentation or information to assist her in filing her tax returns; and (7) these 
multiple factors cumulatively caused her delinquent debts or distracted her from taking 
care of her finances, especially her federal and state income taxes for several years. 
 
Applicant acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of her medical 
and dental debts. She showed numerous payments towards her family’s medical or dental 
debts. She is credited with mitigating the medical and dental financial allegations in SOR 
                                            
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant filed her federal income tax returns for tax year 2016 after her hearing.6 
She did not provide proof that she filed her state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016. 
The DOHA Appeal Board has observed: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
                                            
6 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that she did not timely file her federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal 
Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). On 
January 27, 2019, I emailed Applicant and requested a copy of her 2017 federal and state income tax 
returns; however, she may not have received my January 27, 2019 email. No adverse inference is drawn 
from her failure to provide her 2017 federal and state income tax returns. She received my request for her 
federal and state tax returns for tax year 2016, and she did provide her federal tax return for tax year 2016 
(signed on December 1, 2019). Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for 
tax year 2016 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.

irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant repeatedly failed to timely file her state and federal income tax returns. 
As of February 20, 2019, the date the record closed, she did not provide proof that she 
filed her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. Financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 44 years old, and she has been employed by a defense contractor in 
workforce planning since 2016. In 1996, she received a bachelor’s degree, and in 2001, 
she received a master’s degree in business administration. In 2001, she married, and in 
2012, she separated from her spouse. She has custody of her three children, and her 
husband is living outside the United States.  
 
Several circumstances partially or fully beyond Applicant’s control adversely 
affected her finances. She acted reasonably and responsibly in the overall resolution of 
her medical and dental debts, and she is credited with mitigating the financial allegations 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, and 1.i. She is also credited with paying the tax lien alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.h. 
 
Applicant’s history of failing to timely file her federal and state income tax returns 
raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. She may owe state income 
 
12 
                                         
 
taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016.7 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an 
administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax 
returns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant 
waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.8 The primary 
problem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late filing her tax returns, and she did 
not provide proof that she filed her state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. 
  
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of true financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible 
for a security clearance. The determination of an individual’s eligibility and suitability for 
a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the 
factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. This decision should 
not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of 
reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. In the future, with a track 
record of addressing her delinquent financial obligations and timely filing tax returns and 
paying taxes, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security 
clearance worthiness.    
 
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
  
                                            
7 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
8 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
