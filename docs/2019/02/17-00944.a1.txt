KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: The Judge failed to address that Applicant did not file his Federal income tax return
for 2009 as required.  His 2009 IRS tax transcript reflects that the IRS filed a substitute tax
return for him in early February 2012 and determined he owed an additional $44,731 of taxes for
that tax year.  Applicant changed his W-4 exemptions to “ten” for 2011.  Due to that change in
exemptions, Applicant testified “they weren’t taking any taxes out” of his pay.  Id.  He used the
extra money to purchase a custom motorcycle, which was an item on his “bucket list.”  When
analyzing a case, a Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated or
piecemeal manner that focuses only on matters favorable to one party.  In this case, the Judge
erred by failing to analyze significant matters that undermined his mitigation analysis.  Favorable
decision reversed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
Tara R. Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
March 24, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On October 3, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant’s request for a security clearance. 
Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s favorable
decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
Applicant, who is 60 years old, has been an employee of a defense contractor since 2015. 
He has been married twice and has three adult children.   He admitted the sole SOR allegation that
asserted he had a Federal tax lien of about $48,000 filed against him in 2014.  This lien was incurred
because he owed past-due income taxes for 2009-2011.1  He attributed this debt to not being
prepared to be the owner-operator of a business, to suffering a heart attack in 2009 that resulted in
a period of unemployment, and to helping his daughter with her expenses.  
In 2017, Applicant made two Offers in Compromise to the IRS.  In December 2017, as
evidenced by IRS correspondence and his banking statements,  he reached an installment agreement
with the IRS to make monthly payments of $878.  He also received financial counseling.   
The Judge’s Analysis
“Applicant’s tax lien has been addressed through an agreement with the IRS.  He is making
payments pursuant to that agreement.  He has also received financial counseling to ensure that future
financial problems are unlikely.  Mitigation under AG ¶ 20 has been established.”  Decision at 5.
   
Discussion
Department Counsel argues that the record in this case does not support the Judge’s
favorable mitigation analysis.  She also contends that the Judge did not consider important aspects
of the case and his analysis runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Department
Counsel’s arguments have merit. 
A Judge is required to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation
for” the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”
1 Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts reflected that, as of February 2018, he owed $46,219 of past-due taxes and
interest for 2009, did not owe past-due taxes for 2010 (his 2010 tax debt was resolved in 2012), and owed $870 of
interest for 2011.  Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) N.  
2
Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43
(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371, U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  “The
general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests
of the national security.’”   Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  “Any doubt 
concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of
the national security.”  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A ¶ 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge’s
decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. 
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.
There is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See
Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After
the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to
rebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  “The application of disqualifying and
mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more
of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of
sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.”  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at
3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).
In deciding whether the Judge’s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the
Judge’s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate
a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts
found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;
it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs
contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference
of opinion.  Id.
At the outset, we note Department Counsel’s arguments are of mixed merit.  She repeats an
argument that the Board has rejected at least twice, i.e., “Mitigating Conditions 20(d) and 20(g) must
be read in concert and harmony with the overall parameters of analysis set forth by the Appeal
Board.”  Appeal Brief at 13.  This is not accurate.  As we have previously stated, “The Appeal Board 
and Hearing Office Judges are creatures of the Directive.  While some analysis and precedents might
survive amendments to the Directive or guidelines, it is mistaken to believe that the guidelines are
somehow inferior to the Appeal Board’s decisions.  More succinctly, the provisions of the Directive,
including the guidelines, are controlling.”   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4, n.2 (App. Bd.
Jun. 29, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018).  Furthermore,
Department Counsel’s relevant arguments rely entirely on case law that predates the current
guidelines without any acknowledgment that the content of the new guidelines may have narrowed
or superceded the prior case law.  
That said, Department Counsel’s other arguments, such as her contention that the Judge did
not consider important aspects of the case, are meritorious.  She points out that the Judge failed to
address that Applicant did not file his Federal income tax return for 2009 as required.  His 2009 IRS
tax transcript reflects that the IRS filed a substitute tax return for him in early February 2012 and
3
determined he owed an additional $44,731 of taxes for that tax year.2  AE N.  She also notes that
Applicant changed his W-4 exemptions to “ten” for  2011.   Tr. at 37.  Due to that change in
exemptions, Applicant testified “they weren’t taking any taxes out” of his pay.  Id.  He used the extra
money to purchase a custom motorcycle, which was an item on his “bucket list.”  Id. and 65-66. 
When analyzing a case, a Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated
or piecemeal manner that focuses only on matters favorable to one party.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
14-05005 at 8 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017).  In this case, the Judge erred by failing to analyze
significant matters that undermined his mitigation analysis.  
Department Counsel also challenges that Judge’s conclusion that Applicant’s recent
installment agreement mitigates the security concerns arising from his past-due taxes for 2009 and
2011.  First, she argues the Judge erred in failing to address the timing of Applicant’s actions to
address his tax deficiencies.  As we have previously stated, a Judge may consider the underlying
circumstances of tax debt in evaluating an applicant’s reliability and judgment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 17-00378 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2018).  Furthermore, an applicant who resolves financial
problems after being placed on notice his or her security clearance was in jeopardy may lack the
judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate
threat to his own interests.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). 
Applicant’s 2009 IRS tax transcript reflects that he made one $100 payment towards his 2009 tax
deficiency before the SOR was issued in March 2017.  AE N.  After issuance of the SOR, he made
sporadic payments and submitted an Offer in Compromise (which was later withdrawn) before he
entered into an installment agreement with the IRS one month prior to the hearing.  In her brief,
Department Counsel also points out that Applicant has been consistently employed since 2005 (with
the exception of a four-month period in 2009-2010), and he had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of
about $117,000 in 2014.3  Additionally, Department Counsel notes that Applicant only submitted
proof of one payment under the installment agreement, which was made after the hearing was held. 
She argues that proof of one payment under a 62-month installment plan is less than convincing
evidence that Applicant was adhering to or in compliance with the installment agreement.4     
2 Applicant’s 2009 IRS tax transcript also reflects that his tax return for that year was received on February 14,
2012.
3 Tr. at 35-36, Government Exhibit 1, and AE N.  Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts reflect that he filed as “Single”
for 2009-2011 and his AGI for those years ranged from about $47,400 to $78,100; he filed as “Head of Household” for
2012 and his AGI was about $51,600; he filed as “Married Filing Joint” for 2013 and 2014 and his AGI for those years
was about $83,700 and $117,000; and he filed as “Married Filing Separate” for 2015 and 2016 and his AGI for those
years was about $53,300 and $44,700.    
4 In the decision, the Judge failed to identify the specific mitigating conditions that applied.  He noted five
mitigating conditions were potentially applicable.  Those mitigating conditions are set forth in Directive , Encl. 2, App.
A ¶¶ 20(a)-(d) and (g) as follows:
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment;
4
“National security eligibility determinations take into account a person's stability,
trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, and judgment.”  Directive , Encl. 2, App.
A ¶ 1(b).   Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with
abiding by well-established government rules and regulations.  Voluntary compliance with rules and
regulations is essential for protecting classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at
3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016).  In this case, Applicant failed to address his significant 2009 Federal
income tax debt for a number of years and did so only after his security clearance was in jeopardy. 
Such a failure raises questions about whether he has demonstrated the high degree of judgment and
reliability that is required for granting an individual access to classified information.  
 
We conclude that the Judge’s decision failed to consider important aspects of the case and
runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record
evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under
the Egan standard.
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death,
divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a
legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts; [and]
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the
amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.
As written, the Judge’s decision leaves us guessing which mitigating conditions he concluded either fully or partially
applied.  This was error.  As we have previously stated, the Judge’s decision must be written in a manner that allows the
parties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018).
