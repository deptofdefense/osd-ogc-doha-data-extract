CEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 31, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended 
(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed 
Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2018, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 25, 
2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
on November 14, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 4, 2018. The hearing was 
convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which 
were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left 
open until January 4, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant presented  
11 documents, which Applicant marked Applicant’s Exhibits (AppXs) A through N (AppX 
 
2 
 
H~K is one and the same document addressing four past-due debts to the same 
creditor). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 13, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g., and 1.k. 
through 1.n. He denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.h. through 1.j. After a thorough and careful 
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 line 
4 to page 15 line 5, and GX 1 at pages 5 and 15.) He has been employed with the 
defense contractor since March of 2016, but he does not currently have a security 
clearance. (Id.) Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 2008~2013. (TR at page 14 
line 11 to page 15 line 23, and GX 1 at page 25.) He was deployed “to Iraq in 2009,” 
and “to Afghanistan in 2010 to 2011.” (Id.) As a result, he receives 70% compensation 
from the Veterans Administration. (TR at page 15 lines 2-~23.) Applicant received an 
Honorable Discharge. (GX 1 at page 26.) 
 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant attributes his current financial difficulties to a divorce in 2012, and 
periods of unemployment in 2013 and in 2014. (TR at page 15 line 9 to page 19 line 2.) 
 
 1.a.~1.d., 1.f., and 1.k.~1.n. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to eight 
different creditors totaling about $20,121. (TR at page 19 at line 23 to page 23 line 8, at 
page 26 line 7 to page 33 line 2, and at page 35 line 14 to page 36 line 19.) On New 
Year’s Eve, four months after the issuance of the SOR, Applicant sent the following two 
line, letter request to each of these creditors. (AppXs a~d, f, and k~n.) In each letter he 
simply requested the following: “this letter is being sent to you to request information on 
my account. I would like to be sent a statement with current amount due and minimum 
monthly payment options to be able to resolve this credit account.” (Id.) Applicant’s 
recent requests, though laudable, are too little too late. He has had years to address 
these known delinquencies that remain outstanding. These allegations are found 
against Applicant.  
 
 1.e. Applicant has paid the alleged $35 past-due debt to Creditor E, as evidenced 
by correspondence with Creditor E. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 35 line 13, and AppX 
E.) This allegation is found for Applicant. 
 
 1.g. Applicant successfully disputed an alleged $14,257 past-due debt to Creditor 
G; and as such, it does not appear on the Government’s two most recent 2018 credit 
reports. (TR at page 24 line 16 to page 26 line 6, and GXs 4 and 5.) This allegation is 
found for Applicant. 
 
 1.h.~1.j. Applicant successfully disputed three alleged past-due debts, totaling 
about $3,104, to Creditor H; and as such, they do not appears on the Government’s two 
 
3 
 
most recent 2018 credit reports. (TR at page 23 line 9 to page 24 line 15, and GXs 4 
and 5.) These allegations are found for Applicant. 
 
      Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant’s 
national security eligibility. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states the “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall 
be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
  Applicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to 
raise these disqualifying conditions.  
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered 
all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 including: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
5 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing and continuing. He has a long history 
of delinquencies, and significant past-due indebtedness that he has only recently begun 
to address, through  simple two sentence letters requesting “information.” He has clearly 
not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG ¶ 20 
has not been established. Guideline F is found against Applicant. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial 
Considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a.-1.d.:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g.-1.j.:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k.-1.n.:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility 
for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
