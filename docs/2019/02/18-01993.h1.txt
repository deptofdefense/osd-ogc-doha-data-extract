LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
Statement of the Case 
On August 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Applicant responded to the SOR on August 24, 2018, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 1, 
2018.  
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
on November 5, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 19, 2018. The hearing was 
convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through D, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for 
Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted documents that I have marked 
AE E through O and admitted without objection.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since March 2018. He has a bachelor’s degree, which was 
awarded in 2010. He is single without children.1 
 
 Applicant was unemployed for about six months after he graduated college, for 
several months in 2014, and for about three weeks in 2016. He also had periods of 
underemployment wherein he was unable to find full-time work. He was unable to pay 
all his bills, and a number of debts became delinquent.2 
 
 The SOR alleges three delinquent bank or credit union debts totaling $21,750; a 
$145 debt to a cable company; a $288 medical debt; and three defaulted student loans. 
However, the $570 defaulted student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a duplicate of one of 
the other two defaulted student loans. The total of those two loans is $4,952. The non-
duplicate allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions. 
 
 Applicant contracted with a credit-counseling company in about August 2018. He 
enrolled four debts in the company’s debt-management program (DMP), including the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($4,810), 1.d ($288), and 1.e ($145). The fourth debt of 
$1,451 is to his state, which Applicant said was for overpaid unemployment 
compensation. Applicant testified that he was paying $235 a month to the DMP. The 
DMP documentation calls for Applicant to pay $169 per month, which the company 
disburses to the four creditors, minus a $22 maintenance fee. Applicant paid an initial 
fee of $75 in September 2018. He made $169 payments in September and October 
2018; followed by $57 payments in November 2018, December 2018, and January 
2019; and a $46 payment in February 2019.3 
 
 Applicant paid $256 on January 29, 2019, outside the DMP, to resolve the 
remainder owed on the $288 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.4 
 
 Applicant thought that he was paying $120 per month through the DMP toward 
the $8,476 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He was informed that the 
debt was not one of the four debts in the DMP. He then stated that the debt was being 
paid outside the DMP to a collection company on behalf of the creditor, and later that he 
was unsure whether the debt was being paid. He did not provide any supporting 
documentation or additional information about the status of the debt.5

 Applicant and the creditor for the $8,464 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b agreed to 
settle the debt for $2,539. Applicant agreed to pay $105 per month until July 2020. He 
established through documentation that he made $105 payments in August 2018, 
November 2018, and December 2018.6  
 
 The defaulted student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($3,555) and 1.e ($1,397) are 
paid. Applicant provided documentation of payments of $2,237 in March 2017; $2,138 in 
March 2018; and $815 in August 2018.7 
 
 Applicant stated that his current finances are better since he has a stable job with 
a good salary. He credibly stated that he intends to pay his debts.8 
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
                                                          
6 Tr. at 42-46; AE C, D, H. 
 
7 Tr. at 52-61; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A, L, M. 
 
8 Tr. at 30-32, 60-61, 68-69.

or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence 
is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
The $570 defaulted student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is a duplicate of one of the 
two defaulted student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. When the same conduct is 
 
5 
 
alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations 
should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 21, 2005). SOR ¶ 1.f is concluded for Applicant. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment wherein he was 
unable to find full-time work. Those conditions were beyond his control. 
 
 The student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($3,555) and 1.e ($1,397) were 
resolved through payments of $2,237 in March 2017; $2,138 in March 2018; and $815 
in August 2018, which indicates that Applicant started addressing his financial problems 
more than a year before the SOR was issued. He contracted with a credit-counseling 
company in about August 2018. He enrolled four debts in the company’s DMP, including 
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($4,810), 1.d ($288), and 1.e ($145). He is also paying 
a $1,451 debt to his state for overpaid unemployment compensation through the DMP. 
He completed the payment of the $288 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d outside the 
DMP. He is making payments toward the $8,464 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. 
 
  Applicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but a security clearance 
adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an 
applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 
(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to 
resolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There 
is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid 
first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  
 
 I believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address all his debts. 
I find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action 
to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a 
 
6 
 
good-faith effort to pay his debts. It may take time, but I am convinced that he will 
eventually resolve his financial problems.9 The above mitigating conditions are 
applicable. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:   For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
9 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. 
May. 31, 2011): “Depending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant’s debts will not be paid 
off for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.”

Conclusion 
 
 It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
