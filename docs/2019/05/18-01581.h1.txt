Decision 
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: 
Based on the record in this case,1 I deny Applicant’s clearance. 
On 12 October 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. 2 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 26 
February 2019, and I convened a hearing 8 April 2019. DOHA received the transcript 30 
April 2019, and the record closed. 
1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-2, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant exhibits 
(AE) A-F. AE E-H were timely received post hearing. AE E-G comprise Applicant’s 2014 Federal income tax 
return. 
2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on 8 June 
2017.

Findings of Fact 
Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 48-year-old cyber 
security specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since 2016. He has been self-
employed in similar positions since October 2010. His clearance status is unclear. 
Since 2010, Applicant has started a series of businesses, sometimes with 
partners, sometimes solo. The tax structures of the various companies complicated his 
personal taxes, which he found overwhelming. Consequently, he failed to timely file his 
income tax returns as required. He considered obtaining professional help, and dabbled 
some with an individual who was prepared to handle matters going forward, but who 
was not prepared to handle his back taxes. He recently hired an administrator, attorney, 
and bookkeeper for his company, and his delinquent personal income tax returns were 
filed in April 2019. He did not consider timely filing of his tax returns to be an urgent 
matter, as he understood there was no penalty for filing late if a refund was due (Tr. 25-
26). He also changed his withholding so that he would almost always overpay, and be 
entitled to a refund. 
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns 
for tax years 2010-2017 (2010-2013 for SOR 1.a; 2014-2017 for SOR 1.b), and that the 
2014-2017 tax returns remained unfiled at the time of the SOR. Applicant’s November 
2018 Answer included Applicant’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts for tax 
years 2008-2017. Tax years 2008-2009 are not at issue. Applicant’s 2010-2013 tax 
transcripts show that he timely filed for an extension of time to file for tax years 2010, 
2011, and 2013, and that he timely filed his 2010 and 2013 income tax returns. 
Although he timely filed for an extension for 2011, he did not file his tax return until nine 
months after the extended due date. While he did not file for an extension for tax year 
2012, he filed the return within three months of the due date. He received substantial 
tax refunds for each of the years, although he owes about $800 on tax year 2013 for 
otherwise unexplained late payment penalties and interest (AE H). Applicant did not file 
for extensions of time to file for tax years 2014-2017, and they remained unfiled at the 
time of the SOR. AE A-G show that Applicant filed his 2014-2018 Federal income tax 
returns in April 2019. He apparently has refunds totaling about $32,463 for state and 
Federal taxes for 2014-2017, but owes about $19,345 for 2018. 
Applicant provided no work or character evidence, or evidence of community 
involvement. He has not received credit or financial counseling. He provided no budget. 
Specifically, while he submitted evidence that his delinquent taxes had now been filed, 
he provided no evidence of contacts with the IRS to show his proposed arrangements 
for reconciling the results of the four tax returns. 
Policies 
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability 
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.

Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, 
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case 
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to 
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, 
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). 
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government 
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, 
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case. 
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden 
of persuasion. 
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship 
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, 
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. 
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any 
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 
Analysis 
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his 
4 Federal income tax returns for 2011, and 2014-2017, as required. Applicant knew he
was required to file his income tax returns, and he knew that his stated reason for failing 
to file did not excuse his conduct. 
The Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may
demonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. 
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good 
judgment and reliability required of persons granted access 
to classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously 
noted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their 
legal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to 
3 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).

the same;

have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and 
reliability required for access to classified information.”5 
This is true whether the failure to file is willful6 or attributed to the press of family 
circumstances. 7 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of 
clearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal 
or state income tax returns for 10 years. 
The filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal 
obligation. Applicant’s . . . failure to have done so for many 
years is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling 
to follow other rules and regulations, such as those that 
govern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A 
person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good 
judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 
(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the 
Judge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 19(g) explicitly 
provides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that 
can raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive 
presumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct 
under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s eligibility for a 
clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 9, 2015)8 
Security concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an 
Applicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. Indeed, the 
Appeal Board has recently ruled that “failure to file tax returns by itself can be a reason 
to deny a clearance”.9 
5ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge’s favorable decision. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). 
6 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). 
7 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). 
8The cases cited by Applicant’s post-hearing brief all involve cases where the failures to timely file occurred 
over three-four years, and none of them has been identified as an Appeal Board case. 
9 See, ISCR Case No. 16-03208 (App. Bd. Feb, 28, 2018).

Finally, the fact that Applicant over-withheld on his taxes, or the fact that he does 
not appear to owe any taxes for the tax years in question, does not mitigate the 
judgment concerns raised by his pattern of failing to file in a timely fashion. Nor does the 
fact that the IRS has not undertaken any enforcement action against. 
None of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations apply. His failures to 
timely file his Federal taxes are both recent and multiple, and may not be demonstrated 
to be unlikely to recur.10 He has cited no circumstances that would demonstrate that his 
failures to file were due to circumstances beyond his control. Certainly, he chose to start 
several new businesses. Moreover, Applicant was not responsible in addressing his 
taxes. Applicant is an intelligent, well-educated man, with both the skill and experience 
to know when he should engage professional help. Yet, he did not do so for many 
years, and apparently only when his clearance was at risk.11 
The circumstances of this case do not suggest that Applicant would benefit from 
credit or financial counseling, but his taxes have been partially resolved to date.12 
Applicant has documented what his tax accountant thinks his tax situation is, but there 
is no evidence of the IRS’s view of his taxes.13 Applicant’s tardy contacts with the IRS 
cannot be considered a good-faith effort to address his taxes, 14 to the extent that this 
mitigating condition could be considered applicable. Moreover, Applicant had mostly 
disregarded these tax obligations since at least October 2015, when he missed his first 
extended filing deadline, and again since May 2017, when he discussed his delinquent 
taxes with a Government investigator. His documented inaction for almost another two 
years—until April 2019, when he filed the four remaining delinquent returns—raises 
significant security concerns that Applicant has not addressed by the flurry of activity 
triggered by his receipt of the SOR. And that flurry of activity fails to mitigate Applicant’s 
overall course of conduct, as it cannot overcome my conclusion that Applicant’s track 
record of at least four years procrastination makes it too soon to conclude that his 
security-significant conduct is behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. 
10¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that 
it is  unlikely to recur . . . 
11¶20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and 
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
12¶20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control; 
13The fact that the IRS may not yet have taken action on Applicant’s lately-filed taxes can only be attributed 
to Applicant’s ongoing delays in filing his taxes. 
14¶20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.

Subparagraphs a-b: Against Applicant 
Conclusion 
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. Clearance denied.
