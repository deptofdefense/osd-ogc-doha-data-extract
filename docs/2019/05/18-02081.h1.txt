GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 27, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On a May 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He 
responded to those interrogatories on June 14, 2018. On September 28, 2018, the DOD 
CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and 
Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position, effective June 8, 2017.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 In a sworn statement, dated November 8, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2018. The case was 
assigned to me on January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019. 
I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 3, 2019. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 15, 2019. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and timely submitted additional documents which were marked and admitted into 
evidence as AE O through AE X without objection. The record closed on May 3, 2019. 
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 During the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend 
the SOR to correct what he identified as an administrative or clerical error to conform to 
the expected evidence in the record. The motion was to amend SOR ¶ 1.b, by deleting 
the number $19,071.29, and substituting therefor the number $28,703.35. The motion 
was granted over Applicant’s objection.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments most of the factual 
allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.d.). Applicant’s admissions and comments 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving 
under a variety of titles (i.e., drafting supervisor, lead technologist, and engineering 
analyst) with his current employer (known by a variety of names after acquisitions) since 
December 2005. A 1966 high school graduate, he received an associate’s degree in 
1974. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1968, and he was honorably discharged 
in October 1969 with a pre-existing physical disability. He was granted a secret clearance 
in October 2006. Applicant was married in 1970, and divorced in 1982. He remarried in 
1986, and was divorced three months later that same year. He married his current wife in 
1987. He has two daughters, born in 1973 and 1984.

Financial Considerations2 
 
It is unclear to what factors Applicant attributed his financial problems, or to when 
those factors actually commenced. He generally referred to various situations with some 
financial significance to him, but he does not claim that they caused him not to timely file 
his federal income tax returns or to have insufficient funds to pay any of his debts. They 
were simply alternative ways to spend his money. For example, he mentioned taking a 
sabbatical or temporary retirement at the age of 50; a year of sailing from Michigan around 
the Gulf of Mexico to various locations in Florida; family medical issues; there was a stock 
market “setback;” being disorganized; he lost or misplaced all of his records for the tax 
year 2012 during a move in 2013; his parents died in 2016; there was a hurricane in 
October 2018; he purchased some property for an autistic grandson; and he and his wife 
have paid for, and attended, various real estate investment programs to create a business 
for a decent retirement income.3 While Applicant mentioned those factors, he submitted 
no specific information or documents to indicate in what way they were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control; and what impact they may have had on his finances and actions 
relative thereto. 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): When it was time for Applicant to file his federal income tax return 
for the tax year 2012, he timely filed for an extension, and he sent the IRS an estimated 
payment of $1,397. The IRS granted the extension until October 15, 2013.4 During the 
extension period, Applicant was unable to locate the necessary supporting 
documentation, such as his W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and other documents, and 
he eventually failed to timely file his income tax return by the end of the extension period.5

             5 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual’s gross 
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the 
following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title 
or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with 
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect 
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
 
                                      
 
Although he made some unspecified efforts to locate the necessary documentation, both 
from the IRS and from his employer, his efforts proved fruitless, and they were essentially 
abandoned by him.6 As of June 2018, when he responded to the interrogatories, Applicant 
had still not filed his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012.  In April 2019, six 
and one-half years after the extended due date for the filing, and over six months after 
the SOR was issued, Applicant reported that he was able to obtain a copy of his W-2. He 
claimed that he finally sent his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012 to the IRS 
during the week of the April 2019 hearing.7 Applicant did not submit a copy of the subject 
federal income tax return to support his claim that it had finally been filed. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal income tax return for the tax year 2013.8 An official Account Transcript from the 
IRS reflects that Applicant failed to file his 2013 income tax return until March 2015, one 
year after it was required to be filed.9 Applicant’s adjusted gross income during the tax 
year 2013 was reported to be $186,348. During the period 2014 through early 2017, the 
IRS issued several notices to Applicant, assessed penalties, additional taxes, and 
interest, and eventually issued a levy. In April 2017, an Installment Agreement was 
established under which Applicant agree to have $700 per month automatically withdrawn 
from his bank account. Because of some incorrect bank account information, monthly 
withdrawals were attempted but promptly cancelled. As of June 4, 2018, Applicant’s tax 
balance plus accruals was $28,703.35.10 In October 2018 – approximately one month 
after the SOR was issued – Applicant agreed to a new Installment Agreement, restarting 
the $700 monthly withdrawals. As of April 2, 2019, the unpaid balance for 2013 has been 
reduced to $26,936.90.11 The 2013 delinquencies are finally in the process of being 
resolved.

years" for "1 year."

8 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal 
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to 
evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider 
whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular 
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis 
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also 
ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. 
Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged 
failure to timely file his federal income tax returns will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant timely filed his federal income tax return for the tax year 
2014. His adjusted gross income during that tax year was initially reported to be 
$86,275,12 but that amount was subsequently increased to $130,675.13 During the period 
2015 through early 2017, the IRS issued several notices to Applicant, assessed penalties, 
additional taxes, and interest, and eventually issued a levy. In April 2017, the Installment 
Agreement described above was established, but eventually terminated. Although the 
new Installment Agreement was established in October 2018, restarting the monthly 
withdrawals, priority has been given to the resolution of unpaid 2013 taxes while 
Applicant’s unpaid 2014 taxes wait in line with the unpaid balance increasing. In March 
2019, Applicant’s unpaid 2014 balance was $15,294.48,14 and on April 2, 2019, it had 
increased to $15,344.15.15 The 2014 delinquencies are not yet in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal income tax return for the tax year 2015, claiming that when he received IRS 
notification regarding his tax issues for the tax years 2012 through 2014, he “was flustered 
. . . and forgot to file or pay.”16 An official Account Transcript from the IRS reflects that 
Applicant failed to file his 2015 income tax return until November 2016, one month after 
it was required to be filed if an extension request had been made, or six months after the 
original due date.17 In this instance, there is no evidence that Applicant requested an 
extension. Applicant’s adjusted gross income during the tax year 2015 was reported to 
be $132,246. During the period late 2016 through early 2017, the IRS issued several 
notices to Applicant, assessed penalties and interest, and eventually issued a levy. In 
April 2017, the Installment Agreement described above was established, but eventually 
terminated. Although the new Installment Agreement was established in October 2018, 
restarting the monthly withdrawals, priority has been given to the resolution of unpaid 
2013 taxes while Applicant’s unpaid 2014 and 2015 taxes wait in line with the unpaid 
balances increasing. In March 2019, Applicant’s unpaid 2015 balance was $9,447.65,18 
and on April 2, 2019, it had increased to $9,476.19.19 The 2015 delinquencies are not yet 
in the process of being resolved.

Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to reflect his $7,195 net 
monthly income; $3,311 in monthly expenses; and a purported $3,428 in debt payments, 
including his IRS payments, with a $456 monthly remainder.20 As of April 2019, in addition 
to $51,757 in unpaid federal income taxes,21 Applicant currently owes a total of $176,604 
for a mortgage, a vehicle loan, and six credit cards or charge accounts.22 In Applicant’s 
payoff schedule, he set priorities for the resolution of all of his accounts, including his 
unpaid IRS balance. Of the nine accounts listed, the IRS holds the least priority, and it 
has him scheduled to continue making monthly $700 payments over the next five years, 
with three final balloon payments of nearly $4,000 commencing in December 2023.23 He 
noted that such a plan does not interfere with his 401(k) contributions, and it allows him 
to retire again in five years as previously planned.24  
Approximately five years ago, Applicant met with a financial planner to set up an 
annuity for his eventual retirement.25 While he claimed to have a three-ring binder of 
paperwork from his financial planner, Applicant did not specify or identify any of the 
documents, and, although he was asked to submit such information, and indicated that 
he would do so, he failed to submit any documentation to indicate the nature of the 
financial counseling that he received. In addition, Applicant stated that he is now working 
with a different financial planner, since his first one passed away, and they are reviewing 
Applicant’s retirement plans to make sure they are sound, and Applicant does not incur 
any additional tax burdens as a result of turning 70 and one-half.26 There is some 
evidence to indicate that Applicant’s financial situation, with respect to his federal income 
taxes, is now under better control.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 The current project manager of the program in which Applicant works, has known 
and worked with Applicant since 2005. He characterized Applicant as honest to a fault, 
dependable, and a consummate professional in every sense of the word. He also 
described him as a very valued friend, confidant, and a dedicated colleague. Applicant 
provides exceptional services vetting procurements, providing quality control for 
prototype fabrication, and ensuring the government client receives fair value for every tax 
dollar spent, as well as ensuring the warfighter receives the best products, services and

described him as honest, professional, and very diligent in his work efforts.28 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”29 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”30   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”31 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant

31 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.32  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”33  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”34 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:  
      
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
                                                          
32 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG 19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012 (as 
well as for the tax year 2015); failed to pay annual federal income taxes as required for a 
multi-year period; and currently owes the IRS approximately $51,757 in unpaid federal 
income taxes, interest, and penalties. The failure to timely file income tax returns has 
security implications because:35 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior

evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.36 
Furthermore, since a security clearance represents an obligation to the federal 
government for the protection of national secrets, a failure to honor other obligations to 
the government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.37 In this instance, while Applicant may have 
eventually filed his two late federal income tax returns, and he may now be properly 
motivated, he waited six and one-half years after the extended due date for the filing, and 
over six months after the SOR was issued, to supposedly file his federal income tax return 
for the tax year 2012, during the week of the April 2019 hearing. As for the unpaid 2013, 
2014, and 2015 income taxes, Applicant waited until April 2017 to establish an Installment 
Agreement (that was eventually terminated because of incorrect information), and then 
reestablished in October 2018 – approximately one month after the SOR was issued – 
restarting $700 monthly withdrawals. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been 
established. As there is no evidence that Applicant was unwilling to satisfy his debts 
regardless of the ability to do so, AG ¶ 19(b) has not been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;38 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
                                                          
 
36 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis 
as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax 
returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
37 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). 
 
38 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).

(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;39  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements.  
AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(g) partially apply, but none of the remaining mitigating 
conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” 
or that it is “unlikely to recur.” While Applicant generally referred to various situations with 
some financial significance to him, he does not claim that they caused him not to timely 
file his federal income tax returns or to have insufficient funds to pay his federal income 
taxes. They were simply alternative ways to spend his money. Taking a sabbatical at the 
age of 50; spending a year of sailing around the Gulf of Mexico; and seeking alternative 
avenues of funds for retirement, do not qualify as being largely beyond Applicant’s control. 
Being disorganized seems to be Applicant’s major problem with regard to his federal 
income tax issues. Losing or misplacing all of his records for the tax year 2012 during a 
move in 2013 does not explain his failure to file his 2012 federal income tax return until 
2019. Other than the ineffective and terminated Installment Agreement that was 
established in 2017, Applicant essentially made little meaningful efforts to file his income 
tax return for the tax year 2012 or make voluntarily good-faith payments to reduce his 
outstanding 2013 through 2015 income tax balances until after he was seemingly 
motivated to do so by the issuance of the SOR.  
The Appeal Board previously observed that:40 
 
                                                          
39 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

[t]he mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment 
arrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to 
issue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating 
condition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether 
the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. 
The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to 
consider in the application of [pertinent mitigating conditions]. 
An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed 
on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment 
and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate 
threat to his or her own interests.41 Applicant’s actions, or inaction, under the 
circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.42 
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.  
 
Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further confirmed action, are 
insufficient. In this instance, Applicant’s evidence of self-reformation and self-
rehabilitation to voluntarily comply with the tax filing requirements in the future fail to 
remove the lingering doubts that remain whether he has demonstrated the judgment, 
reliability, and willingness to abide by well-established rules and regulations that is 
required for granting a security clearance.43 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
                                                          
41 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 
3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018).

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.44  
  
There is some evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 70-year-old 
employee of a defense contractor, serving under a variety of titles with his current 
employer since December 2005. A 1966 high school graduate, he received an associate’s 
degree in 1974. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1968, and he was honorably 
discharged in October 1969 with a pre-existing physical disability. He was granted a 
secret clearance in October 2006. His project manager and a coworker both think highly 
of him, and they essentially describe him as honest, dependable, professional, and a very 
valued friend, confidant, and a dedicated colleague. Applicant may have eventually filed 
both of his late federal income tax returns, and he may now be properly motivated to 
timely file federal income tax returns in the future. There is no evidence of any security 
violations.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for a multi-year period; failed to 
pay annual federal income taxes as required; and currently owes approximately $51,757 
in unpaid federal income taxes, interest, and penalties. He waited six and one-half years 
after the extended due date for the filing, and over six months after the SOR was issued, 
to supposedly file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2012, during the week of 
the April 2019 hearing. As for the unpaid 2013, 2014, and 2015 income taxes, Applicant 
waited until October 2018 to establish a working Installment Agreement with the IRS – 
approximately one month after the SOR was issued – starting $700 monthly withdrawals. 
Applicant’s current financial focus is on his second retirement, five years from now, 
and his repayment plans reflect that paying his unpaid federal income taxes is low on his 
listed priorities. When an issue involving taxes arises, it is proper to consider how long an 
applicant waits to file their tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt 
arises to begin and complete making payments. The primary concern in this instance is 
that Applicant has repeatedly been late filing his federal income tax returns, and while he 
offered some explanations for his actions, those explanations do not adequately justify 
the lengthy delays in completing the required actions. Under the circumstances described 
                                                          
44 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-
3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

above, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:45 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of both debt reduction 
and elimination efforts and in his efforts to timely file his federal income tax returns, 
seemingly avoiding doing so until he was alerted that his eligibility for a security clearance 
had become an issue. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and 
doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his 
financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
