GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On October 5, 2018, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals 
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility 
to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. 
 
The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
 
2 
                                      
 
to grant Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract 
with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on September 11, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated 
November 2, 2018, supplemented by an e-mail, dated November 9, 2018, Applicant 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 
20, 2018. The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on March 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 2, 2019. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and timely submitted additional documents which were marked and admitted into 
evidence as AE J through AE V without objection. The record closed on May 2, 2019. 
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to 
the evidence presented. The motion was to amend SOR by adding two new allegations: 
“1.c. – You failed to timely file, as required, your federal income tax returns for tax years 
2012 and 2013; and 1.d. – You failed to timely file, as required, your federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2016 and 2017.” The motion was granted without objection.1 
  
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR and the amended SOR, Applicant admitted with 
comments three, and a portion of a fourth, of the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.c., and a portion of SOR ¶ 1.d.).2  Applicant’s admissions and comments 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving 
as a field service technician with his current employer since April 2010. A 1985 high 
school graduate, he received an associate’s degree in 1989. Applicant has never served 
with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if he ever 
held a position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in 1988. He 
was remarried in 1991, and divorced in 1994. He married again in 2002. He has four 
children, born in 1987, 1993, 2003, and 2007.

Financial Considerations3 
 
Applicant’s financial difficulties first arose in 2000, and they continued over a multi-
year period, essentially because he was withholding too little from his federal and state 
income for tax purposes. As a result, over the years, a substantial number of federal and 
state tax liens were filed against him for various amounts, with some as small as $50, and 
one as large as $34,501.4 It took Applicant approximately one decade to resolve the state 
income tax issues, and a number of them were released in 2014, 2015, and 2016. He 
had a repayment plan with the state, and by paying the state approximately $9,800, the 
state tax liens were eventually released. During the intervening period, a son was born in 
2003 with temporary health issues, and then he developed other conditions, including 
Attention Deficit Disorder, Learning Disability, Hyperactivity, Autism, and Epilepsy.5 The 
medical expenses caused by those issues were approximately $8,000 per year.  
 
Because Applicant also had similar issues with respect to his federal income taxes 
involving the payment of insufficient income taxes, and the imposition of increasing 
interest, essentially during the period 2000 through 2009, in January 2009, he sought the 
assistance of a company specializing in obtaining tax relief, and agreed to pay them 
$344.44 for the draft modification request form, plus a $25 fee. Based on the figures 
presented to the company, an offer in compromise analysis was prepared.6 It is unclear 
if it was rejected by the IRS or even submitted to the IRS. Nevertheless, federal tax liens

as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess 
an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to 
decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence 
for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App.

Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged state income tax issues, as well as other federal income tax issues 
described further below, will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

were filed against Applicant in February 2009, in the amount of $34,501 (SOR ¶ 1.a.), 
and in June 2009, in the amount of $7,533 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).7 In November 2018, Applicant 
acknowledged that “a significant balance remains unpaid. I have paid some toward the 
original debt though not much due to household (sic) bills and obligations.”8 While there 
are some tax very recent post-SOR and post-Notice of Hearing payments to the IRS: 
$611.87 and $131.77 of the unpaid 2011 tax balance of $744.28 on March 21, 2019, and 
April 10, 2019, when a total of $611.87 was paid, or tax refunds applied by the IRS, and 
Applicant contends that the federal tax liens are no longer listed on his credit report,9 
there is no evidence that those federal tax liens have been released.  
 
Applicant’s federal income tax issues were not limited to simply failing to pay his 
income taxes over the years. He also had a substantial history of failing to timely file his 
federal income tax returns over a multi-year period, something he referred to as “a 
mistake.”10 For example, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file 
his federal income tax return for the tax year 2002, and as of April 24, 2019, only a 
substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS.11 Applicant also failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for: the tax year 2012, until August 3, 2015;12 the tax year 
2013, until May 25, 2015;13 the tax year 2016, until April 1, 2019,14 although Applicant

             10 Tr. at 29. The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual’s 
gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, 
the following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title 
or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with 
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect 
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 
years" for "1 year."

claimed it was initially filed timely, but not properly recorded;15 and the tax year 2017, until 
April 1, 2019.16  
Applicant’s reported adjusted gross income in 2014 was $70,227; in 2015, 
$79,180; in 2016, $78,332; and in 2017, $75,979. Applicant submitted two slightly 
different Personal Financial Statements, both dated May 1, 2019, to reflect his $3,459.97 
(versus $3,173.71) net monthly income; $1,644 (versus $1,814) in monthly expenses; 
and a purported $1,082.64 (versus $1,082.64), not including any payments to satisfy 
federal tax liens or for unpaid income taxes; leaving a remainder of $733.33 (versus 
$197.07) that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.17 Both of 
Applicant’s Personal Financial Statements reflect that he has stocks and pensions worth 
$100,000, a mobile home, a boat, a truck, and a luxury automobile. 
Applicant’s only effort of obtain financial counseling appears to be his post-hearing 
acquisition of a book, Total Money Makeover, by Dave Ramsey, a national radio host 
dealing primarily with financial issues.18 Applicant did not explain what corrective actions 
he has taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other factors that he identified 
as the ones that caused him financial difficulties. He offered only generalized explanations 
for his failures to routinely timely file his federal income tax returns; to make more timely 
efforts to pay his unpaid federal income taxes; and to resolve his federal tax liens. While 
he apparently has a monthly remainder of either $733.33 or $197.07, depending on which 
version of his Personal Financial Statement is accurate, there is a paucity of evidence to 
indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  
Policies 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”19 As Commander in Chief, the President 
has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained 
in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.20

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for a public trust position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”21 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.22  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance 
determinations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on 
the side of denials.23 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that 
                                                          
covers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for 
trustworthiness determinations. 
 
21 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
      
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns 
under AG ¶19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for a multi-year period 
(tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017, as well as the unalleged 2002); failed to pay 
annual federal income taxes as required for a multi-year period; had $42,034 in federal 
tax liens filed against him in 2009; and he may still owe the IRS unpaid federal income 
taxes, interest, and penalties. The failure to timely file income tax returns has 
trustworthiness implications because:24 
                                                          
 
24 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR Case 
No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); 
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance [and by inference, a trustworthiness] 
adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it
directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a
proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id.
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of
those granted access to classified [and by inference, sensitive] information.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173,
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness [or trustworthiness] in light of [his or her] longstanding 
prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income 
tax returns.25 Furthermore, since a public trust position represents an obligation to the 
federal government for the protection of sensitive information, a failure to honor other 
obligations to the government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information.26 In this instance, while 
Applicant may have eventually filed his late federal income tax returns, and he may now 
be properly motivated, he generally waited for extensive periods after the due dates for 
the filings, and, with respect to the federal tax returns for the tax years 2016 and 2017, 
until April 2019, approximately six months after the SOR was issued. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 
and 19(f) have been established. As there is no evidence that Applicant was unwilling to 
satisfy his unpaid federal income taxes or federal tax liens regardless of the ability to do 
so, AG ¶ 19(b) has not been established. 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
25 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis 
as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information, and by inference sensitive 
information, with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).

(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;27
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;28
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions
to resolve the issue; and
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those
arrangements.
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the remaining mitigating 
conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
issues make it difficult to conclude that it “was so infrequent,” or that it is “unlikely to recur.” 
27 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
28 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant’s SOR-related financial difficulties first arose in 2000 and continued through 
2009 when he failed to withhold sufficient income for his federal income taxes. That led 
to two federal tax liens being filed against him in 2009. However, that was only one aspect 
of his federal income tax problems, for he also failed to timely file his federal income tax 
returns for a multi-year period. While Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties 
to health issues and the failure to withhold the necessary income, in the absence of more 
complete explanations and some documentation to support his contentions, neither of 
those factors was due to conditions that were largely beyond his control. Federal (and 
state) personal income taxes went unpaid, and while the state issues were apparently 
resolved in 2009, Applicant never obtained an installment agreement with respect to his 
delinquent federal income taxes, and he offered no documentation to indicate that the 
federal tax liens have been released.  
 
It is difficult to conclude that Applicant made substantial timely good-faith efforts to 
resolve his unpaid federal income taxes, despite periods of having reasonably good 
income. Furthermore, Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns over 
a multi-year period is of considerable concern, because while an individual may have 
insufficient funds to pay his or her taxes, that is not an acceptable justification for not 
timely filing federal income tax returns.  
 
The Appeal Board previously observed that:29 
 
[t]he mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment 
arrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to 
issue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating 
condition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether 
the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. 
The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to 
consider in the application of [pertinent mitigating conditions]. 
An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed 
on notice that his trustworthiness eligibility is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment 
and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate 
threat to his or her own interests.30 Applicant’s actions, or inaction, under the 
circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.31 
Trustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines 
do not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the

SOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant 
immediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, 
nor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. 
Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such 
debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time.  
 
Mere promises to pay debts and timely file income tax returns in the future, 
especially after multi-year delays in taking timely actions, without further confirmed 
actions, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant’s evidence of self-reformation and self-
rehabilitation to voluntarily comply with the tax filing requirements in the future fail to 
remove the lingering doubts that remain whether he has demonstrated the judgment, 
reliability, and willingness to abide by well-established rules and regulations that is 
required for granting eligibility for a position of public trust.32 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant 
eligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I 
have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record 
evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.33  
  
There is some evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 52-year-old 
employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a field service technician with 
his current employer since April 2010. A 1985 high school graduate, he received an 
associate’s degree in 1989. Although Applicant failed to pay sufficient state income taxes 
over a multi-year period from 2000 until 2009, and state tax liens were filed against him, 
                                                          
32 See ISCR Case No. 17-01256, supra note 29, at 5. 
 
33 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-
3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
12 
he took decisive action with respect to his state income tax issues, and by 2009 or 2010, 
he paid off his delinquent state income taxes. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant also has had a long-standing problem with his federal income taxes, having 
failed to withhold sufficient funds to cover his federal income taxes over a multi-year 
period. Those failures resulted in the IRS filing two federal tax liens against him in 2009, 
totaling $42,034. While there are some very recent post-SOR and post-Notice of Hearing 
payments to the IRS on March 21, 2019, and April 10, 2019, and Applicant contends that 
the federal tax liens are no longer listed on his credit report, there is no evidence that 
those federal tax liens have been released. Accordingly, he may still owe the IRS unpaid 
federal income taxes, interest, and penalties. However, of greater significance is 
Applicant’s seemingly routine practice of failing to timely file his federal income tax 
returns. While Applicant offered some explanations for his untimely actions, those 
explanations do not adequately justify the lengthy delays in completing the required 
actions. Considering all of the above, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining 
to Applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:34 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
Applicant has demonstrated a fair track record of debt reduction and elimination 
efforts, taking a decade to reduce or eliminate most of his unpaid income taxes. As for 
his routine history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns, he has 
demonstrated a poor track record. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial 
34 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).

questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of public 
trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the 
trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, 
¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of 
public trust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is denied.
