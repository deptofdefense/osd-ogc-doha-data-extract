HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 The statement of reasons (SOR) alleges, and Applicant admits he had seven 
misdemeanor-level arrests from 1990 to 2017. Most were related to his consumption of 
alcohol. He made some positive steps towards rehabilitation; however, security concerns 
under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct) are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 4, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On June 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position 
(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under 
Guidelines G and J. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
On August 4, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. (HE 3) On October 3, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
 
2 
                                         
 
October 16, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On March 19, 2019, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for April 
25, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.   
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered 
three exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 11-14; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-C) Applicant’s response to the 
SOR was also admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 7-8) On May 13, 2019, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He 
also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has been 
employed as a calibration technician for his current employer since 2008.2 In 1982, he 
graduated from high school. He attended three semesters of college, and he completed 
several certified training courses. (SOR response) In 1985, he married, and in 2016, he 
divorced. His children were born in 1991 and 1993. In October 2016, Applicant married 
his second wife. (Tr. 15-16) There are two step children in his home who are ages 14 and 
15. (Tr. 29) Applicant and his spouse are trying to adopt a special-needs baby with Downs 
Syndrome. (Tr. 33-34, 81) He has held a security clearance for about 31 years. (Tr. 83; 
SOR response) If he loses his security clearance, he will lose his employment. (Tr. 85) 
 
Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct 
 
The SOR alleges the following conduct of security significance. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in June 1990, Applicant was charged with Operating a Vehicle 
While Drunk. It was dark and raining, and Applicant hit a car with his motorcycle. (Tr. 45-
47) Applicant received minor injuries. (Tr. 47) The car left the scene of the accident. (Tr. 
46) Applicant refused a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 46) He received nonjudicial punishment 
under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and a general discharge under 
honorable conditions because of misconduct. (Tr. 46, 48; GE 1 at 12-13) He conceded 
his blood-alcohol level exceeded the legal limit. (Tr. 46) 
 
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges in November 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
Disorderly Conduct-Brawling/Fighting-Domestic Violence. Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 2.b; 
however, he said the case never went to court because the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
2 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) 
 
3 
                                         
 
70-71; GE 3; SOR response) There is no evidence that this incident was related to his 
alcohol consumption. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges in March 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving 
Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). (GE 1) Applicant drank five or six rum and cokes at 
a bar. (Tr. 87; GE 3) The police stopped Applicant because of a traffic violation. (Tr. 50) 
He kept burping, and the police were unable to conduct a breathalyzer. (Tr. 50) The police 
did not complete the breathalyzer test or attempt to conduct a blood-alcohol test. (Tr. 51) 
He attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice a week for six months. (Tr. 88) 
He was required to remain sober for one year. (Tr. 88) He successfully completed the 
diversion plan, and the charge was dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 52; GE 2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in August 2012, Applicant was charged with Disorderly Conduct 
and Criminal Trespass. (GE 1) Applicant said he drank about two drinks at a party; 
however, he told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he drank 
five or six drinks and that he was intoxicated. (Tr. 55, 90; GE 3) He left the party, and he 
followed a 16-year-old girl to her apartment which was located in the same building as 
the party. (Tr. 53, 90-91) At the time, he said he thought the girl he was following was an 
adult. (Tr. 109) She told him he could not come inside her apartment, and he went to the 
parking lot where his vehicle was located. (GE 3) He left the parking lot and he returned 
to her apartment because he said he needed to obtain directions. (Tr. 54) She told him to 
leave; they argued; and her father evidently called the police. (Tr. 92, 110, 115; GE 3) 
The owner of the apartment where the party occurred was cited for serving alcohol to 
minors. (Tr. 110) Applicant conceded that alcohol played a part in his decisions because 
if he had not been drinking he would not have needed directions. (Tr. 55-56, 92) He 
pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. (GE 3) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges in June 2013, Applicant was charged with DUI. (GE 1) The 
police stopped Applicant for a traffic violation. (Tr. 56-57) His blood-alcohol test (BAT) 
result was .187. (Tr. 57) Applicant believed he could drive, and he did not think he was 
“impaired” even though his BAT was .187. (Tr. 57, 93-94) Applicant was found guilty of 
DUI, and he was on probation for one year. (Tr. 94; GE 1; GE 3) He received a $1,000 
fine, and he was required to remain sober during his probation. (Tr. 94; GE 1) After 
completing probation, he reduced the number of occasions in which he drove after 
drinking alcohol. (Tr. 58, 95) He limited his alcohol consumption to one beer when he is 
going to drive. (Tr. 58) SOR ¶ 2.a cross alleges the information in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.d as criminal conduct. 
 
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges in September 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
Domestic Battery-Knowing/Reckless Bodily Harm. (GE 1) The assault involved 
Applicant’s first wife. (Tr. 30-32) Applicant had about two drinks of an alcohol beverage. 
(Tr. 72, 95) He was angry, and he pushed and kicked a door, which struck his spouse’s 
hand. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he did not see her when he hit her with the door. (Tr. 69) 
She also claimed he threw keys at her and hit her; however, he denied that the keys hit 
her. (Tr. 72-74) He threatened to sell the house. (Tr. 74) The part of the OPM summary 
of interview and the police report indicating he threatened to kill everyone in his home are 
incorrect. (Tr. 75, 96-97; GE 3) The police arrested him, and he was issued a 72-hour 
 
4 
                                         
 
restraining order. (Tr. 69; GE 3) His spouse wanted Applicant to come home, and the 
prosecutor dismissed the charges. (Tr. 70, 76; GE 1) 
 
Applicant’s current spouse met his first spouse on one occasion at a wedding, and 
his current spouse described his first spouse as aggressive and violent. (Tr. 30-32) His 
current spouse observed his first spouse as she assaulted Applicant at a wedding, and 
his first wife was so out of control that it was “like you see in the cartoons.” (Tr. 30-31) 
 
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges in July 2017, Applicant was charged with Domestic Battery-
Bodily Harm. Applicant had gone out drinking. (Tr. 97; GE 2) His current spouse took his 
wallet and his identification cards and credit cards. (Tr. 98-99) She threw his wallet 
outside, and she locked him out of the house. (Tr. 98; GE 3) She subsequently returned 
his identification and credit cards to him. (Tr. 99) A day or so later, Applicant and his 
spouse were involved in a physical altercation. He said she was the aggressor, and he 
was only attempting to keep her from driving his truck. (Tr. 77) His spouse hit him, and 
her ring cut his face. (Tr. 78)  
 
Applicant’s spouse’s description of the July 2017 altercation with Applicant was 
consistent with Applicant’s description. Applicant’s spouse said that she and Applicant 
argued about his alcohol consumption several days before he was arrested for assault. 
(Tr. 37) She took his wallet. (Tr. 37) She was anxious about when he would come home 
after work. (Tr. 38-39) She said she was “yelling and screaming and lying and saying he’s 
hurting me.” (Tr. 18) She said they had a “scuffle” because he took her car keys and 
passport and because she had taken pain medication and consumed alcohol. (Tr. 18) 
Her purse was in his vehicle, and it contained her passport and car keys. (Tr. 20) She 
attributed the altercation to her use of alcohol together with “Prozac and really high doses 
of steroids.” (Tr. 19) She felt angry and aggressive, and she hit him. (Tr. 19-20) He was 
not aggressive; however, the videotape showed him not letting her in his truck and pulling 
her away from his truck. (Tr. 20) She believed the police arrested Applicant because he 
is a large person; he was yelling; and a witness made a statement against him. (Tr. 21-
22) He did not punch her; however, she had “some scrapes and things.” (Tr. 22) She said 
she lied to the police about the abuse because she was angry, and the drugs were 
affecting her judgment. (Tr. 22)  
 
Applicant’s spouse asked the prosecutors not to charge Applicant, nevertheless, 
they prosecuted him. (Tr. 23) He pleaded guilty; and he received a “deferred judgment” 
probation agreement. (GE 2; AE A) He received fines and court costs totaling $482. (GE 
2) His probation specified that he was not supposed to consume alcohol from February 
2018 to February 2019. (Tr. 102-103; GE 2 (stating that he would “[u]se no alcohol”) He 
said he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to his probation officer because 
he did not consider it to be relevant. (Tr. 103)3 His probation officer did not specifically 
ask him whether he consumed alcohol. (Tr. 105) He conceded violating probation was 
pertinent, but he did not consider it to be crucial. (Tr. 103-104) He received a deferred 
                                            
3 Applicant’s August 4, 2018 SOR response indicates he has “complied and continues to comply 
with his probation” requirements. (SOR response at 4, 6) His SOR response indicates that he “no longer 
drives while under the influence” of alcohol. (SOR response at 3)       
 
5 
                                         
 
sentence, and he remained on probation until February 2019. (Tr. 79) On February 28, 
2019, the domestic violence offense was dismissed with prejudice. (AE A)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges on November 28, 2017, Applicant stated at an OPM interview 
that he drank alcohol every day, and he drank alcohol to intoxication every other week. 
(GE 3) Applicant admitted that he drank three or four beers almost every day, and every 
other weekend he drank seven or eight beers. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3) In the past five years, 
Applicant drank enough alcohol to have blackouts once or twice. (Tr. 115) Applicant’s 
spouse said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2017. (Tr. 16)  
 
On March 30, 2018, Applicant received an alcohol use assessment.4 It did not 
recommend counseling or treatment. (Tr. 105) He reported his arrests in 2006, 2011, 
2013, and 2017 to security. He said he drank two to six drinks twice a week. He completed 
alcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013.  
 
Applicant said he attends counseling once a week or more often as needed, 
meditation, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as needed. (Tr. 63, 82) He most 
recently attended an AA meeting three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 113-114) He said 
he attends AA meetings once or twice a month; however, he did not attend enough AA 
meetings to receive any AA coins. (Tr. 114) In May 2018, he completed a class on 
domestic violence. 
 
More recently, Applicant used Uber or public transportation in lieu of driving himself 
after he consumes alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) Applicant said he decided to quit consuming 
alcohol in 2017, and he actually stopped drinking “[a]bout that time.” (Tr. 101, 116-117) 
He subsequently had a couple of relapses. (Tr. 101, 106, 117-118) He said the last time 
he consumed alcohol was in August 2018. (Tr. 102, 106, 118)5 His spouse also stopped 
consuming alcohol, and they do not have alcohol in their home. (Tr. 17) They do not go 
to bars. (Tr. 25) Applicant does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. (Tr. 111) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
In the winter of 2017, Applicant’s spouse had major surgery. (Tr. 18) After she 
married Applicant, she had a stroke, transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, an embolism, 
broken bones from a fall, a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, 
and blood clots. (Tr. 27-28) She spent 41 days in intensive care. (Tr. 28) She was 
bedridden for a time. (Tr. 28) She said the post-surgery drugs affected her memory. (Tr. 
18) Applicant has been very supportive of her. (Tr. 18-28) He attended marriage 
counseling and classes. (Tr. 23) She supported approval of his security clearance. (Tr. 
36, 43-44) 
                                            
4 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is an alcohol assessment 
on March 30, 2018. (SOR response) 
 
5 Applicant’s spouse did not pay attention to the amount of beer he drank. (Tr. 41) She did not 
notice when he stopped drinking alcohol for several weeks. (Tr. 42) She was unable to say whether he 
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017, 2018, or 2019. (Tr. 43)  
 
6 
                                         
 
Applicant’s 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations 
or meets expectations for all categories. (AE B; SOR response) The general sense of the 
statements of six of Applicant’s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he 
is diligent, reliable, peaceful, dedicated, intelligent, professional, and compliant with 
procedural requirements. (AE C; SOR response) 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
applicant’s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility 
for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial evidence” 
is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area 
Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
 
7 
                                         
 
an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 
1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or 
the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and 
trustworthiness.” 
   
  AG ¶ 22 lists conditions under the alcohol consumption guideline that could raise 
a security concern and may be disqualifying including: 
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other 
incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol 
use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the 
welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol 
use disorder; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., 
physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social 
worker) of alcohol use disorder; 
 
(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; 
 
(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment 
recommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and 
 
 
8 
                                         
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, 
treatment, or abstinence. 6  
 
  AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Applicant’s SOR in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d allege and the 
record establishes four alcohol-related incidents involving the police, courts, or his 
command from 1990 to 2013. His BACs for three of the four alcohol-related incidents are 
unknown. His BAC for the June 2013 DUI was .187, and it establishes that he engaged 
in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.7  
 
  AG ¶ 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: 
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol 
use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; 
 
(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has 
no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory 
progress in a treatment program; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along 
with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established 
                                            
6 Applicant’s SOR does not allege: (1) his domestic battery in 2015 (SOR ¶ 2.c) as being alcohol-
related; (2) his violation of probation by consuming alcohol; and (3) his alcohol-related blackout in the 
previous five years. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These 
three non-SOR alcohol-related concerns will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. 
 
7 “Binge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.” See 
the Center for Disease Control website, (stating “The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 
0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when 
women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.”), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-
drinking.htm. There are other definitions of “binge alcohol consumption” that involve different alcohol-
consumption amounts and patterns.

pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment 
recommendations. 
   
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many 
different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly 
lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 
3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); 
ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-
04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial of security clearance for Applicant with 
alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior to hearing). For example, in ISCR 
Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board reversed the 
administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”   
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board 
reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB 
had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most recent DUI was in 2000, 
six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his alcohol 
consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol 
consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and 
capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving 
case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing 
administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
In the last five years, Appellant drank sufficient alcohol to have a blackout. Alcohol-
related blackouts are a consequence of binge-alcohol consumption. During an alcohol-
related blackout, a person: 
 
is still fully conscious. They’re moving around, acting, engaging, talking, 
dancing, driving, engaging in all kinds of behavior, but because of alcohol’s 
inhibition of the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term 
memory, they simply will be unable to remember those decisions or actions 
they made while in the blackout.8 
 
A person who is in blacked-out state, may still “engage in voluntary behavior and 
thought processes. ‘They might make decisions, for example, to drive home from a bar, 
or [engage in other] . . . activities which require complex cognitive abilities, but the 
                                            
8 In United States v. Pease, 74 M.J. 763, 769 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), an expert on the effects 
of alcohol intoxication, Dr. Kim Fromme,  Ph.D., described the levels of alcohol intoxication and the impact 
on human behavior, cognitive abilities, and memory. See also United States v. Collins, No. 201000020, 
2011 CCA LEXIS 22 at *4-*8. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2011) (unpub.) (testimony of prosecution toxicology 
expert, Jon Jemiomek).

individual might not remember the next day and might, in fact, might regret it.’”9 A person 
who consumes alcohol to a blacked out state may not remember how much alcohol they 
consumed, or they may violate national security and have no recollection of their conduct. 
 
Applicant presented evidence supporting mitigation of alcohol-consumption 
concerns. Applicant said he attends alcohol-related counseling once a week or more often 
as needed, meditation, and AA meetings as needed. On March 30, 2018, Applicant 
received an alcohol use assessment. (SOR response) It did not recommend counseling 
or treatment. In his evaluation, he disclosed that he drank two to six drinks twice a week. 
He completed alcohol treatment or counseling in 2006 and 2013. As of his March 30, 
2018 assessment, his most recent alcohol use was in December 2017.  
 
The evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant was involved in a 
total of five alcohol-related incidents from 1990 to 2015. His probation for his July 2017 
domestic battery specified that he was not permitted to consume alcohol from February 
2018 to February 2019. He said he had a single relapse; however, he did not report it to 
his probation officer because he did not consider it to be relevant. He said the last time 
he consumed alcohol was in August 2018, and he does not intend to drink alcohol in the 
future.   
 
Six factors weigh against mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns: (1) 
Applicant’s five alcohol-related arrests; (2) his reluctance to permanently abstain from 
alcohol consumption; (3) his binge-alcohol consumption; (4) his resumption of alcohol 
consumption after previous periods of abstinence and alcohol-counseling attendances; 
(5) his violation of probation by consumption of alcohol, and his failure to disclose that 
violation to his probation officer; and (6) his abstention from alcohol consumption for less 
than one year. I have carefully considered the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption and Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption. I have lingering doubts and 
concerns about Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment 
pertaining to his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security concerns 
are not mitigated.  
 
Criminal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, “Criminal activity 
creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very 
nature, it calls into question a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations.” 
 
AG ¶ 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be 
unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in 
                                            
9 Pease, 74 M.J. at 769. See also United States v. Clark, NMCCA 201400232 at *13-*17, *22-*23. 
(NMCCCA Jul. 14, 2015) (statements of Dr. Stafford Henry, M.D. and Dr. Thomas Grieger, M.D.). 
 
11 
                                         
 
combination cast doubt on the individual’s judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness; and 
 
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. 
 
The SOR alleges, and Applicant admitted he was arrested for misdemeanor-level 
criminal conduct seven times from 1990 to 2017. AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(b) are established. 
 
AG ¶ 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and 
those pressures are no longer present in the person’s life; 
 
(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; 
and 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited 
to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, 
compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher 
education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions are established for the reasons discussed in the 
alcohol consumption section. Five of the seven incidents of criminal conduct are alcohol 
related. For the reasons stated in the section concerning Guideline G, he failed to 
establish mitigation under Guideline J.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
 
12 
                                         
 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. “In evaluating an applicant’s case, a 
Judge must carefully consider the record as a whole. This includes not only considering the 
extent to which an applicant’s circumstances raise concerns about his or her reliability but 
also giving fair consideration of the applicant’s mitigating evidence.” ISCR Case No. 12-
09900 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00424 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 
20, 2016)). My comments under Guidelines G and J are incorporated in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some 
warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has been 
employed as a calibration technician for his current employer since 2008. He has three 
semesters of college, and he completed several certified training courses. He has held a 
security clearance for about 31 years. There is no evidence of security violations. His 
spouse had multiple serious illnesses, and he has been very supportive of her. He 
attended marriage counseling and classes. She supported approval of his security 
clearance. His 2017 and 2018 performance reviews indicate he exceeds expectations or 
meets expectations for all categories. The general sense of the statements of six of 
Applicant’s coworkers, a family support worker, and friends is that he is diligent, reliable, 
peaceful, dedicated, intelligent, professional, and compliant with procedural 
requirements,  
 
The six factors listed in the alcohol consumption section, supra, weigh against 
granting Applicant access to classified information. The three most important factors are: 
he has a lengthy history of five alcohol-related arrests from 1990 to 2015; he relapsed 
after abstaining from alcohol consumption; and his current abstinence from alcohol 
consumption is for less than one year before his hearing. Based on these factors, I have 
lingering doubts and concerns about Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment. A significant probability of alcohol-related judgment errors in the future 
continues to exist, and this possibility of future judgment errors raises ongoing questions 
about his reliability and trustworthiness. See AG ¶ 21.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as 
set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that Guidelines G and J 
security concerns are not mitigated.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
