METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: 
Based on the record in this case, 1  I deny Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
On 14 December 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) raising trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations. 2  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a decision 
without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in 
this case closed 20 April 2019, when Applicant’s Response to the FORM was due. 
Applicant provided no additional evidence. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 May 2019.

Findings of Fact 
Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.g-1.h. He is a 
49-year-old critical facilities engineer sponsored for a public trust position by a defense 
contractor, for whom he has worked since July 2016. He has not previously had a 
trustworthiness determination. He was briefly unemployed May-July 2016, but had been 
continuously employed as a maintenance engineer from May 2004 to May 2016. 
Applicant married in May 1991, separated in August 2016, and divorced in September 
2017 (Item 2, 3). He and his ex-wife have two adult children. 
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 2-5) establish, 14 delinquent 
debts totaling over $28,000 (SOR 1.b-1.o); the SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to 
timely file his 2014-2016 state income tax returns (SOR 1.a). Applicant admits over 
$24,000 in delinquent debt, as well as admitting failing to timely file his 2014-2016 state 
income tax returns. He claims to have settled SOR debt 1.g in October 2018 (Answer; 
Item 3). However, Applicant’s evidence shows that he settled a delinquent debt that was 
not alleged in the SOR. 3 Applicant also claimed to have paid the automobile loan at 
SOR 1.h. While the automobile title Applicant submitted with his Answer does not 
corroborate that claim, Applicant’s October 2018 credit report shows the account paid 
as of July 2017.4 
The remaining debts comprise three state tax liens, totaling over $12,000, filed in 
January and July 2013; three unpaid medical bills totaling over $800; a nearly $7,000 
automobile repossession; a 2013 judgment for $2,500, and five collection accounts 
totaling over $2,600. The automobile repossession is a joint account with his ex-wife. 
The medical debts and collection accounts are reported as Applicant’s individual liability. 
All but a couple of the delinquent debts predate Applicant’s separation from his wife. 
Applicant disclosed his failure to timely file his 2014-2015 state income tax 
returns, as well as his failure to file his 2014-2015 Federal income tax returns (not 
alleged), on his March 2017 clearance application (Item 2). He discussed his tax issues, 
including his failure to timely file his 2016 state and Federal tax returns, during a 
January 2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3). He was also 
confronted with his SOR debts, based on his April 2017 credit report (Item 4). He 
claimed to not be aware of some of the debts, but stated that he would investigate all 
the debts discussed and take action to address them.
3Applicant’s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) shows a delinquent mattress retailer store credit card, with its 
sponsoring bank, and a full 16-digit account number. This account was reported in collection, but also closed, 
with a zero balance, and was not alleged in the SOR. The 2 October 2018 settlement letter provided by 
Applicant is from a collection agent for a different sponsoring bank, but with an account number that exactly 
matches the original creditor. 
4Applicant’s April 2017 credit report (Item 4) showed the account 60-days past due for $237 on a $2,948 
balance. His October 2018 credit report (Item 5) shows the same creditor, with an account number matching 
the first 12 digits of the original debt, as current, with no stated balance as of July 2017.

Applicant attributes his financial problems, particularly his failures to timely file his 
state income tax returns, to his contentious separation and divorce. His Answer 
documented that he had finally filed his 2015 and 2016 state income tax returns—after 
he received the SOR—but he had still not filed his 2014 return. He ostensibly has a 
refund coming for one tax year, and owes twice the amount of the putative refund for 
the other tax year, but his tax situation for 2014 remains unclear. Even assuming the 
state seizes the refund and applies it to the balance owed, Applicant did not document 
any payment toward the balance. Moreover, except as noted above, he provided no 
evidence of any efforts to resolve delinquent debts since his divorce. 
Applicant provided no budget or personal financial statement indicating his 
financial situation. He has not documented any credit or financial counseling. He 
provided no work or character references, or evidence of civic or community 
involvement. 
Policies 
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person’s suitability for 
access to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. 
Each decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is 
not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case 
can be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or 
denial of eligibility for a public trust position. Considering the SOR allegations and the 
evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). 
Trustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s public trust position. The 
Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the 
SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s case. Because no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant 
bears a heavy burden of persuasion. 
Persons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship 
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement, 
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. 
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels deciding any 
reasonable doubt about an Applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.5

Analysis 
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant’s delinquent debts predate 
his separation and divorce. With the exception of the automobile account that he paid, 
Applicant has documented no efforts to address his delinquent SOR debts. Moreover, 
the alleged contentiousness of his separation and divorce does not explain his failure to 
communicate with his state tax authority to find an alternative means of addressing his 
unfiled state income tax returns. He did not file his 2015 and 2016 returns until after he 
received the SOR, and he still has not filed his 2014 return.6 
The Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may 
demonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. 
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good 
judgment and reliability required of persons granted access 
to classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously 
noted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their 
legal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to 
have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and 
reliability required for access to classified information.”7 
This is true whether the failure to file is willful8 or attributed to the press of other 
circumstances. 9 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of 
clearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal 
or state income tax returns for 10 years. 
The filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal 
obligation. Applicant’s . . . failure to have done so for many 
years is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling 
to follow other rules and regulations, such as those that 
govern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A 
person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good 
6¶19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history 
of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; 
7ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge’s favorable decision. 
See also, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). 
8 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). 
9 See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file).

judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 
(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the 
Judge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 19(g) explicitly 
provides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that 
can raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive 
presumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct 
under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s eligibility for a 
clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 9, 2015). 
Security concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an 
Applicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case 
his failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant 
tax debt that he has not addressed. 
Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. 
given that he has provided no details about his delinquent debts or his divorce.10 Given 
that most of his debts arose before his separation, he has not demonstrated that they 
arose due to circumstances beyond his control, and he has not documented that he 
took responsible action to address his financial problems.11 His state tax returns remain 
a work in progress, with no clear resolution established.12 Applicant has had no credit or 
financial counseling; he has documented no efforts to resolve his debts.13 Moreover, he 
has obviously not engaged in a good-faith effort to address his debts. 14 Finally, he 
provided no work or character evidence which might support a whole-person 
assessment to overcome the trustworthiness concerns raised by his conduct. 
Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. 
10¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that 
it is unlikely to recur . . . 
11¶20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and 
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
12¶20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount 
owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. 
13¶20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . and there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control; 
14¶20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.

Conclusion 
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
