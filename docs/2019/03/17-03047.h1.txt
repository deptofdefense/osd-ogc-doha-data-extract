Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA)1 on May 18, 2015. On 
October 24, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines 
F and E.2 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
1 Also known as a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86). 
2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security

The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 31, 2018, scheduling the hearing 
for August 28, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 
1 and 2 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A were admitted in evidence without objection. The 
Government submitted a request I take administrative notice of certain relevant Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) statutes and regulations. The request was marked as Hearing 
Exhibit (HE) I and admitted into the record. Applicant testified. The record was held open 
to permit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence in mitigation. E-mails and 
documents marked as AE B and C were submitted and admitted without objection. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old senior systems engineer, employed by a defense 
contractor since 2013. He worked for previous defense contractors since about 2003. He 
graduated from high school in 1981. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1986. He married 
again in 2010, and has one adult child. Applicant has held a security clearance since 
2003. 
 
The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant failed to file Federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2005-2009 and 2011. The SOR also alleges under Guideline E, 
that Applicant failed to disclose that his 2008 and 2009 tax returns were not filed when he 
completed his 2015 SCA. Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegation with explanations, 
and denied the Guideline E allegation, stating that he did not deliberately fail to disclose 
the information. The Guideline F SOR allegation is supported by substantial evidence, 
but the Guideline E allegation is unfounded. 
 
Applicant reported in his SCA, that he worked as a civilian contractor in Iraq from 
2005 to 2010 in support of U.S. Armed Forces. He left Iraq in March 2010, and remained 
unemployed until he began working in Afghanistan in November 2010 to March 2011.3 
He worked in Macedonia from March 2011 to February 2012, when he returned to the 
United States. Applicant was required to file Federal income tax returns,4 however while 
in a combat zone or contingency operation area under IRS rules,5 he received automatic 
extensions to file Federal tax returns until the expiration of 180 days after leaving the 
combat zone or contingency operation area.6 
 
After leaving the combat zone area in 2011, Applicant did not file his Federal 
income tax returns for the tax years while deployed, because of distractions caused by 
searching for a new job, arranging the immigration needs for his foreign-born spouse, and 
                                                     
3 Applicant testified that he worked in Iraq and Afghanistan continuously from 2003 to 2011. 
 
4 See, Title 26, Internal Revenue Code, section 6012 at HE I. 
 
5 IRS Pub. 3, Armed Forces Tax Guide, at 28 (2017). Filing extensions apply to civilian personnel in support 
of the Armed Forces serving in a combat zone or a contingency operation.

moving his family to two different states within six months. After he filed his 2012 Federal 
tax return on time in April 2013, he stated that the IRS notified him about his unfiled tax 
returns. He maintained continuous contact with the IRS thereafter and filed the returns he 
was instructed to file. He stated that he was instructed over the phone on several 
occasions, to file his 2010 tax return, which he signed on January 6, 2013, and received 
by the IRS on June 18, 2013, but was instructed not to file the remaining unfiled returns 
(2005 to 2009 and 2011). He indicated that the IRS was applying a three-year look-back 
period for any refunds owed to the taxpayer, and a six-year look-back period for any taxes 
owed to the IRS. 
 
Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts in evidence show the following: 
 
Tax year 2005 – IRS suspended collection of taxes due to military 
deferment in October 2005; inquiry for non-filing of the tax return issued in 
July 2007; removed suspension of tax collection in April 2011; issued a 
notice in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a zero 
account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. 
 
Tax year 2006 – inquiry for non-filing tax return issued in November 2007; 
notice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a 
zero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. 
 
Tax year 2007 – inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in November 2008; 
notice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a 
zero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. 
 
Tax year 2008 – inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in December 2009; 
notice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a 
zero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. 
 
Tax year 2009 – inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in November 2010; 
notice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a 
zero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. 
 
Tax year 2010 –inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in December 2011; 
notice issued in December 2012; tax return received on June 18, 2013; 
substitute tax return prepared by IRS in July 8, 2013; additional account 
action pending noted in July 2013; final notice before tax is determined by 
IRS issued in September 2013; resolved tax determination in January 2014; 
W-2 withholding was $14,325; additional tax assessed of $17,094 in 
February 2014; penalty for filing tax return after the due date, interest and 
penalties charged February 2014; examination of tax return in April 2014; 
credit transferred from tax years 2013 and 2014 tax refunds applied in 2014 
and 2015.

In August 2014, Applicant received an IRS notice of a balance of $8,555 was due 
for tax year 2010. He filed a petition in 2015 in the United States Tax Court challenging 
the deficiency amount. In May 2015, Applicant and the IRS settled the case with a ruling 
that no deficiency or additional tax was due for tax year 2010.  Applicant agreed to pay 
the $3,376 balance owed, which he paid in July 2017. The tax year 2010 transcript shows 
a zero balance. 
 
Tax returns for tax years 2012 to 2017 were filed on time and no tax is owed. 
Applicant re-contacted the IRS by phone after the hearing, and confirmed that he was in 
full compliance with IRS instructions, and that they did not require him to file any of the 
unfiled tax returns. The IRS representatives contacted would not provide a written 
confirmation. 
 
When Applicant completed his 2015 SCA, he was asked in section 26, to list 
whether “in the past seven years, have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other 
taxes when required by law or ordinance?” He responded “yes,” and stated that he failed 
to file his 2009 return: 
 
“due to working overseas in a war zone, I was not required to file until 
permanent return to the states from working in said war zone. I had not filed 
in a timely manner for several of those years, but have been working with 
the IRS to get all returns filed. 2009 is the only one outstanding at this time, 
though we are still working through 2010 at present.” 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that 2008 tax return was not listed 
because he did correctly count back seven years, rather he thought 2009 was the first 
year to report. Also, since the IRS told him he did not have to file the 2011 return, he did 
not think to list it as a failure to file a tax return. He acknowledged these errors, but noted 
that he listed 2009, which was pending at the time, and did not intentionally or willfully fail 
to list his 2008 and 2011 tax returns. 
 
Applicant is financially stable. He and his spouse earn over $112,000 per year and 
reported a monthly net remainder of over $2,000 after paying expenses. He has no 
delinquent debt, a paid mortgage, and about $76,000 in other assets. 
 
Law and Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2. 
 
 
 
5 
 
National security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. 
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies 
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, 
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b). 
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865  
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial 
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington 
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a 
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed 
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  
 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01- 
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .  
 
The relevant disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19 include: 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish 
the disqualifying condition above. 
 
The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially relevant: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant failed to file tax several years of tax returns when his extensions expired 
after leaving the combat or contingency zone. He did not meet his obligation to file tax 
returns when due. After he filed his 2012 return in 2013, he began a multi-year 
“discussion” with the IRS over which unfiled tax returns were required to be filed. It was 
determined that he owed an additional tax for tax year 2010, and that he should not bother 
to file returns for 2005 to 2009, and 2011. 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
The Appeal Board has long held: 
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, 
reliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant 
Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests 
that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established 
government rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and 
regulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). 
 
Applicant’s complicated tax odyssey arose because of multiple years of work in a 
combat zone that triggered automatic extensions to file Federal tax returns, and his failure 
to follow-up on required returns before his extensions expired. He resumed filing his 2012 
tax return when due, and filed all subsequent returns on time, while diligently 
communicating with the IRS about filing his past-due returns. The matter was settled to 
the satisfaction of the IRS, he filed his 2012 to 2017 returns on time, and he has no unpaid 
Federal tax obligations. 
 
Overall, I find that Applicant has adequately addressed his delinquent tax return 
obligations, and has established a six-year track record of on-time filings. I find sufficient 
evidence that his financial status and tax obligations are under control, and that similar 
problems are unlikely to recur. I find mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20 (a) and (g) apply. 
 
Guideline E: Personal Conduct 
 
  The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. 
 
  AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
  When falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the 
burden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove 
 
8 
 
falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to 
determine an applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission.7 An applicant’s level 
of education and business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to 
disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate.8 
 
  Applicant failed to report unfiled tax returns for tax years 2008 and 2011 in his 2015 
SCA, but listed his unfiled 2009 return and discussed the work he was doing to file his 
2010 return. The evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant deliberately or 
intentionally failed to report these unfiled tax returns. He adequately refuted the allegation 
and convincingly showed that his failure to report the 2009 return was an error in 
calculation; rather he listed 2009. Additionally, he stated that his failure to report his 2011 
unfiled return resulted from his understanding that it was not considered past-due by the 
IRS. These are plausible explanations for his omissions on his SCA, and intentional 
falsification is not supported by the evidence. AG ¶ 16(a) is not applicable. Personal 
conduct security concerns are concluded for Appellant. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶¶ 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant 
national security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person 
concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d).9 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion 
may not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be 
found ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of 
questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG ¶ 2(e). 
 
I considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of 
all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of 
fact and comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant’s 
efforts to resolve his tax-filing obligations satisfactorily complied with IRS directions. He 
has shown a six-year tax filing record, and has no further IRS obligations. Applicant 
carried his burden of proof to establish substantial mitigation. The personal conduct 
allegation is unfounded. 
 
                                                     
7 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). 
 
8 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). 
 
9 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence 
or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
9 
 
Accordingly, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security 
interests of the United States to grant or continue eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:      For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. Clearance is granted.
