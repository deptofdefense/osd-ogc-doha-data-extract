Decision 
______________ 
MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant mitigated financial security concerns about unfiled state and federal 
income tax returns and related tax debt. Applicant’s tax filing issues are in the past and 
he is making regular payments on his remaining tax debt. Applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 29, 
2015. On August 28, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. DOD CAF took this action under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and

Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), 
effective June 8, 2017.  
 
  Applicant answered the SOR on October 4, 2018, and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on November 13, 2018. On November 21, 2018, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the 
hearing for December 11, 2018.  
 
The hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Government’s Exhibits (GE) 
1 through 4 were offered and admitted without objection. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I held the 
record open until January 31, 2019, to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit 
additional information. He did not submit any additional materials.1 DOHA received the 
hearing transcript on January 2, 2019. The record closed on January 31, 2019.  
 
Amendments to the Statement of Reasons 
 
Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.b, concerning a past-due federal income 
tax debt, and added SOR ¶ 1.d, concerning Applicant’s failure to file state income tax 
returns.2 SOR ¶ 1.d reads as follows:  
 
1.d:  You failed to file your [state] income tax returns, as required, for tax 
years 2007-2014.  
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and the newly added SOR ¶ 1.d.3 He denied 
SOR ¶ 1.b, which was withdrawn. His admissions and explanations are incorporated 
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and 
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 52 years old. He has never married, but he has a fiancée, who is 
also his cohabitant. He has a daughter, age 19, who is in college, and an adult son, age 
25. Applicant has a high school diploma. He has worked for his employer, a defense 
contractor, since 1990. He has held a security clearance for many years. (Tr. 12, 18-24, 
                                                          
1 Department Counsel called Applicant to confirm whether he had submitted post-hearing documents, but 
never heard back from him. He does not have e-mail. (Hearing Exhibit III) 
 
2 Tr. 18-25. Applicant did not object to the amendments. He admitted SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 21) Because SOR ¶ 
1.d was added at the start of the hearing, I gave Applicant about seven weeks after the hearing to submit 
responsive documents. (Tr. 118) He did not do so. (HE III) 
 
3 In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a only in part. At the start of the hearing, he admitted it in full. 
(Tr. 16)

29, 46, 109, 110, 115; GE 1) Applicant works in State 1. He has lived for many years in 
State 2, a neighboring state. (Tr. 112-113) 
 
As to federal tax issues, Applicant disclosed on his September 2015 SCA that he 
“failed to file and pay federal income taxes during the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. I 
made payments and loss [sic] income returns.” He estimated that he had failed to pay 
about $5,000 in federal income taxes. He also stated that the debt had been satisfied in 
about May 2012. (GE 1 at 29) 
 
 As to state tax issues, Applicant stated on his SCA, “I do not know why I failed to 
file/pay for the years listed 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.” He 
estimated that he had failed to pay about $15,000 in state income taxes, and said he 
was “still making payments for the unpaid taxes.” (GE 1 at 30) 
 
 Applicant had background interviews on January 23 and 26, 2018. He 
authenticated the interviewing agent’s summaries of those interviews in an Interrogatory 
Response to DOHA in July 2018. (GE 2) Those interview summaries do not address the 
issue of Applicant’s failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns. Applicant 
also had an earlier interview, in July 2017, but the summary of that earlier interview is 
not in evidence. (GE 2 at 6) 
 
 Applicant stated in his January 23, 2018 interview summary that $300 of his 
monthly pay had been garnished to resolve his federal income tax debt. The start date 
is not noted, but the garnishment ended in May 2012, when the IRS notified him that his 
federal income tax debt was satisfied. (GE 2 at 6) This evidence provided the basis for 
the Government’s withdrawal of SOR ¶ 1.b (which Applicant also denied in his Answer). 
 
 Applicant’s State 2 tax debt was initially being paid through a wage garnishment, 
which began in 2015. (GE 3; Tr. 91, 98-100) In November 2017, the garnishment was 
removed when Applicant contacted State 2 tax authorities and arranged to pay $382 a 
month through his bank account to resolve his past-due state income tax debt, 
estimated at about $15,000, for tax years 2007-2014.4 (Tr. 100, 114-115; GE 2 at 6, 7; 
GE 3; AE A) He began those voluntary payments in January 2018. (Tr. 49) 
 
 A “Statement of Account” from State 2’s Department of Revenue shows that as 
of July 2018, Applicant owed $8,465 in State 2 taxes, penalties, and interest, for tax 
years 2013 and 2014. (SOR ¶ 1.c) He had paid $2,934 towards his tax debt during 
2018. The July 2018 “Statement of Account” does not reference any earlier tax years. 
(GE 4)  
 
                                                          
4 This $15,000 figure was erroneously alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b as what Applicant owed in past-due federal 
tax debt. He disclosed on his SCA that he owed $5,000 in federal taxes, not $15,000, and in any event, 
SOR ¶ 1.b was withdrawn, since that debt was paid in 2012.

 Applicant provided a November 2018 bank statement showing that he continues 
to have $382 withdrawn each month towards his State 2 tax debt. (AE A) He did not 
provide documentation from State 2 of an updated balance, but said he had paid an 
additional $1,000 or $1,200 since July 2018, and had about $7,000 left to pay. (Tr. 50, 
62, 70, 98)  
 
 As amended, the SOR alleges that for tax years 2007 to 2014, Applicant failed to 
timely file his federal income tax returns (SOR ¶ 1.a) and state income tax returns (SOR 
¶ 1.d), as required. 
 
 Applicant testified that he filed his state and federal tax returns for tax years 
2007, 2008, and 2009, “all three at the same time,” in 2010. (Tr. 52, 55-57, 64, 82, 86) 
When asked why he filed his returns late, Applicant said he was told by an informal tax 
advisor that “if I didn’t owe taxes I could file three years together.” He also said he heard 
the person who told him this was later indicted. (Tr. 56) (Tr. 82-83) If Applicant filed all 
three of these returns in April 2010, as he said, this would make his 2009 returns timely, 
but his 2007 and 2008 returns late. (Tr. 59, 84) 
 
 While the record is rather unclear on this point, Applicant also testified that, either 
for those years (2007-2009), or perhaps for some years after that (2010-2013), his 
fiancée attempted to file their tax returns on their home computer, through a nationally 
recognized tax preparation software program. (Tr. 51, 52, 55, 68) This “didn’t work out 
altogether correct either. So that just put me deeper in the hole,” he testified. (Tr. 52) It 
is unclear if this refers to calculation of taxes owed, or to tax filings as well.  
 
 Applicant also asserted that, since he worked in State 1, his employer had not 
been withholding state taxes for State 2, where he lives. (Tr. 52) He asserted that he 
was supposed to file state income tax returns both for State 2, where he lives, and a 
“non-resident” tax return for State 1, where he works. (Tr. 52-54, 88, 113)5 He also 
attempted to claim his commuting expenses, because he has an interstate commute to 
and from work every day. This was not successful, and he had to pay a penalty when 
he filed his three years of returns, in 2010. (Tr. 56-57) 
 
 For tax years 2014 through 2016, Applicant hired a tax preparation firm from 
California (not Applicant’s home state) who he heard about on the radio. He paid them 
$5,000. He said they assisted in preparing and filing his federal returns for those years, 
but not his State 2 returns. By the time of his background interviews (2017 and 2018), 
he decided to contact State 2 himself to resolve his state tax issues (as discussed 
above). (Tr. 59-62, 69, 71, 84-94)  
 
                                                          
5 There is no allegation in the SOR about overdue State 1 taxes or tax returns, nor is there any such 
indication in the record. He also has never lived there.

In his Answer to SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant admitted that he “failed to timely file as 
required federal income tax returns for the tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009.” (Answer) 
This comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 29) He did not address tax 
years 2010 to 2014 in his Answer. At the start of the hearing, when this was brought to 
his attention, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a in full, as to all federal tax years alleged. 
(2007-2014) (Tr. 16, 51)  
 
Later in the hearing, however, when asked about the status of his filings for tax 
years 2010-2014, Applicant testified, “[w]ell, I didn’t file on time for [State 2]. As far as 
my federal taxes, I thought that I filed every one [of those years] on time, I honestly did.” 
(Tr. 63; see also Tr. 64) Applicant also said he thought he filed all of those federal 
returns on time “except for maybe one” year, tax year 2014. (Tr. 65) 
 
Applicant acknowledged at hearing, both in answering SOR ¶ 1.d, and later, that 
he filed his State 2 tax returns late, for tax years 2007 through 2014. (Tr. 21, 63, 66, 88, 
91) This admission also comports with what he disclosed on his SCA. (GE 1 at 30) He 
did not file an extension to the annual filing deadline. (Tr. 88) 
 
 Applicant testified that as of the date of the hearing, he had no federal or State 2 
tax returns that remained unfiled, including tax years not alleged (2015, 2016, and 
2017). He stated that since 2014, his federal and State 2 tax returns had been filed on 
time. (Tr. 66-67) He also testified that he owed no past-due federal taxes, and no past-
due State 2 income taxes beyond the $7,000 he still owes for tax years 2013 and 2014. 
(Tr. 69) 
 
 With his July 2018 Interrogatory Response to DOHA, Applicant provided copies 
of account transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2015-2017, 
but not for any earlier tax year. He said he was only able to request those three years 
by phone, and would have had to make a written request to the IRS for earlier account 
transcripts. He did not do that. (Tr. 116) 
  
 Applicant filed his 2015 federal tax return in November 2016 (though it was 
several months late). He filed his 2016 and 2017 federal tax returns on time. (GE 2)6 GE 
2, then, largely supports Applicant’s testimony as to his more recent federal tax filings. 
He was not asked to provide State 2 tax transcripts with the Interrogatory Response. 
  
 Applicant recently began working with a nationally recognized tax preparation 
service. With their assistance, he filed his 2017 state and federal tax returns on time. 
(Tr. 67-68, 86; GE 2) His plan is to use them for his 2018 taxes, and in the future. (Tr. 
108) 
                                                          
6 Applicant submitted federal tax transcripts for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 when he responded to 
DOHA’s Interrogatory. Those returns were not initially submitted as part of GE 2, but were offered by 
Department Counsel during the hearing when they came up during Applicant’s cross-examination. They 
were then included as part of GE 2, and admitted without objection. (Tr. 71-81)

 In 2015, Applicant earned about $69,000 in adjusted gross income; in 2016, he 
earned just under $71,000 in adjusted gross income; and in 2017, he earned over 
$116,000 in adjusted gross income. (GE 2) He attributed this significant increase to an 
extended work assignment in another state when he worked a lot of overtime. His 
current income level is between $60,000 and $64,000 annually, before overtime, and 
about $80,000 including overtime. During summer 2018, Applicant was sidelined for 
several months with an injury, so he earned significantly less income than usual. (Tr. 
101-104) 
 
 Applicant and his fiancée live in a home that she owns. He makes the $520 
monthly house payment. He has a $407 monthly car payment. His daughter is in 
college, and he helps her financially when he can. With his other monthly expenses, he 
has limited funds left over at the end of the month and essentially lives paycheck-to-
paycheck. He has about $70,000 in his 401k plan, and borrowed about $3,000 against it 
for his recent medical expenses. His fiancée is on disability, and does not work. They try 
to keep to a budget but he has not had formal credit counseling. (Tr. 94, 103-108, 111, 
117) 
 
 Applicant loves his country, his job, his children, and his family. He spoke with 
appreciation of the mentoring he received from older employees when his career began 
28 years ago, and seeks to be a mentor now for younger employees himself. He takes 
great pride in the work he does for his country. He understands the need to “dot every ‘i’ 
and cross every ‘t’” both at work and otherwise, and he recognizes that he did not do 
that with his taxes. He is sorry for his actions and recognizes that it was “something I 
brought on myself. But I’m trying to work through it.” (Tr. 27-29, 70, 127-128) 
 
Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the 
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”7 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as

the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The financial considerations security concern is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .

Exemption 6 applies

The guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or 
failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  
 
Applicant disclosed on his September 2015 SCA that he had failed to file several 
years of federal income tax returns (2007-2009) and State 2 income tax returns (2007-
2014) on time, as required. He disclosed about $5,000 in past-due federal income taxes 
and about $15,000 in past-due state income taxes.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c, concerning past-due State 2 income tax debt, is established by the 
record evidence, and the above disqualifying conditions all apply. SOR ¶ 1.b, 
concerning federal tax debt, was withdrawn. 
 
The record as to the status of Applicant’s late-filed federal and State 2 income 
tax returns is less clear. This is, in part, because Applicant’s testimony was at times 
confusing as to who he relied on for tax advice for certain tax years, and because his 
testimony was uncorroborated by clarifying documentation.  
 
Applicant’s tax problems began, at least in part, because he initially relied on 
incorrect advice from an informal tax advisor who told him he could file his tax returns 
three years late if he was due a refund. Applicant also sought deductions to which he 
was not entitled (his interstate commuting expenses) and had to pay a penalty when he 
filed those returns.  
 
Regardless of the reason, Applicant testified consistently that he filed his 2007, 
2008, and 2009 state and federal income tax returns in April 2010. That testimony also 
comports with what he disclosed on his SCA and, as to his federal returns, what he 
admitted in his Answer. I therefore conclude that Applicant filed his 2007 and 2008 state 
and federal tax returns late, but find that his 2009 tax returns were timely. AG ¶ 19(f) is 
established as to Applicant’s 2007 and 2008 federal returns. (SOR ¶ 1.a, in part) 
 
Applicant also disclosed on his SCA, with specific, year-by-year details, that he 
failed to file his State 2 income tax returns for 2007-2014. His testimony also comported 
with that evidence (but for 2009, as noted above). The Government added SOR ¶ 1.d at 
the start of the hearing on the basis of the SCA. Applicant did not object to the 
amendment, though he unquestionably had a right to do so, given its lateness. He was 
given seven weeks after the hearing to provide relevant documentation, but did not do 
so. Nonetheless, AG ¶ 19(f) is established as to SOR ¶ 1.d, given his admission and his 
testimony.

This leaves Applicant’s federal returns for tax years 2010-2014, as alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a. As noted, Applicant did not disclose those federal returns as having been 
filed late on his SCA. He did not address those returns in answering SOR ¶ 1.a in his 
SOR response, confining his answer to tax years 2007-2009.  
 
At the start of the hearing, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a in full. However, his 
testimony did not support that admission, as he then said several times that he thought 
he had filed his federal returns on time, but for 2014. However, it was not until 2014 that 
he retained the tax advisor from California who began to address his federal returns, 
and it was through their assistance that Applicant later began to file his returns in a 
timely manner. Applicant’s testimony is also not supported by documentation that might 
have clarified the matter. I also cannot ignore his unqualified admission to SOR ¶ 1.a in 
full, at the start of the hearing. AG ¶ 19(f) therefore applies to SOR ¶ 1.a (but for his 
2009 returns, which I conclude were timely filed, as noted above).  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
 Applicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns from 2007 
to 2014. He disclosed late-filed income tax returns and related tax debt on his 2015 
SCA. He testified that he pursued tax assistance, from a variety of sources, with varying 
success, for several years. His first tax advisor gave him bad advice, which was that he 
could file his returns three years late if he was due a refund. He cured that in 2010 by 
filing earlier returns. That led to the federal tax debt, which took until 2012 to resolve. He 
and his fiancée then used a nationally recognized computer program to prepare and file 
their returns themselves, but evidently made errors, either as to calculation of taxes 
owed, or as to filing, which put him “deeper in the hole,” as he testified. Applicant then 
hired the tax firm from California in 2014, and they resolved his federal tax returns but

not his state returns. He pursued resolution of those himself and has been making 
regular payments on that debt. Applicant is now using a nationally recognized, reputable 
tax preparer and will continue to do so in the future. His issues with late filing tax returns 
are now in the past. 
 
 The document from Applicant’s state tax authority (GE 4) lists debt from tax 
years 2013 and 2014. I therefore conclude that those returns have been filed and that 
the past-due taxes Applicant owed were then duly calculated by authorities. GE 4 does 
not reference any outstanding tax owed, or any unfiled return, from any earlier year. I 
therefore infer from GE 4 that no earlier (or later) state returns are outstanding. 
Applicant’s past-due state tax debt is nonetheless ongoing, so AG ¶ 20(a) does not fully 
apply. AG ¶¶ 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply to mitigate SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also credit Applicant’s long employment 
record in the defense industry. He has mitigated the financial security concerns. In 
reaching this conclusion, I considered not only Applicant’s credibility, but the record 
evidence as a whole. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or 
doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified 
information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
