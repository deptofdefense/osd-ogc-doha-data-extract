Decision 
___________ 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns were not timely filed for several 
years. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied.      
Statement of the Case 
On January 9, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.

On September 20, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On October 18, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
October 22, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On October 25, 2018, the parties agreed 
on a hearing date of November 26, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
November 26, 2018. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled using video 
teleconference.  
  
Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; there 
were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 16-17; 
GE 1-5) On December 6, 2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing 
(Tr.). The record initially closed on January 28, 2019, and I granted an extension to 
February 15, 2019. (Tr. 47; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) On February 27, 2019, Applicant 
provided a 61-page telefax (includes cover sheet). (AE A)   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.f, and 1.j. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed by various defense 
contractors since 1996. (Tr. 6, 8; GE 1) He is currently a logistician. (Tr. 8) He has no 
periods of unemployment over the previous 22 years. (Tr. 8) In 1980, he graduated from 
high school, and in 2008, he received an associate’s degree. (Tr. 6) He served in the 
Marine Corps from 1980 to 1996. (Tr. 7) He received a medical discharge. (Tr. 7) He 
received a 60 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 
7-8) He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage was in 2012. (Tr. 8) 
His three children were born in 1980, 1981, and 1990. (Tr. 9) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s annual salary is $92,000. (Tr. 18) He has held a security clearance 
since 1983. (Tr. 19-20) In 2013, his spouse lost her job. (Tr. 21) Her salary was about 
$40,000 annually. (Tr. 21) From 2014 to 2016, she had 14 surgeries to her leg, and 
Applicant had health insurance. (Tr. 22) His spouse was unable to work, and they fell 
behind on their mortgage and some of their other bills. (Tr. 22) Starting in mid-2017, his 
spouse began receiving about $1,000 monthly in disability payments. (Tr. 23, 43) When 
her disability payments started, she also received about $32,000 in disability pay as a 
lump sum, and those funds were used to pay some debts. (Tr. 43) She has not been 
employed outside their home since 2014. (Tr. 23)  
 
In 2017, Applicant spent $1,700 to purchase furniture. (Tr. 25) In 2018, Applicant 
purchased two used vehicles and financed $19,000 for one and $17,000 for the other 
vehicle. (Tr. 24) In 2018, he borrowed $2,000 against his motorcycle to pay their rent. (Tr. 
25) When Applicant’s spouse received the $32,000 lump sum disability payment in mid-
 
3 
                                         
 
2017, he did not use the funds from the lump sum disability payment to pay his delinquent 
tax debt because the tax debt was “out of sight, out of mind” at that time. (Tr. 43) 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2014 through 2016. When he completed his January 9, 2017 SCA, he explained 
that he had not filed his tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, and he intended 
to file them in 2017. (GE 1) Actually, he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns 
for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017. (Tr. 28; AE A) His federal income 
tax returns were timely filed for tax years 2013 and 2016. (AE A) Currently, he does not 
owe federal taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013, and he resolved the federal income 
tax debt for those four years through a payment plan in 2014. (Tr. 34) He owes about 
$6,000 of federal income taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016, and he does not have a 
payment plan to resolve this tax debt. (Tr. 33-34; AE A) His tax refunds for tax years 2017 
and 2018 will be sufficient to fully resolve his delinquent federal income tax debt. (AE A 
at 3) The following table provides additional information about Applicant’s federal income

SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax 
years 2010 through 2013. He said he filed his state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 
2013, in 2014. (Tr. 26) He filed his state tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, 
in 2017. (Tr. 26-27) At the time of his hearing, he had not yet filed his state tax returns for 
tax year 2017. (Tr. 27) He may have owed about $1,500 for tax years 2010 through 2013, 
and he paid that debt. (Tr. 32) He started a payment plan for tax years 2014, 2015, and 
2016; however, he was unable to complete it because of medical bills for his spouse’s 
surgeries. (Tr. 32) He believed he had a state tax lien for about $1,100, and he paid it. 
(Tr. 31, 33) 
 
Applicant said he did not have the funds to pay his taxes, and he decided to “wait 
three years and then take care of it.” (Tr. 29) He acknowledged this was not the correct 
approach for handling taxes. (Tr. 29) He promised to call the state tax authority the day 
after his hearing to request supporting documentation and to provide the information to 
Department Counsel. (Tr. 31, 33) He was unsure about what tax documentation he had 
at home. (Tr. 35) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant had a delinquent mortgage account that went into 
foreclosure. In 2007, he purchased a residence and financed about $154,000. (Tr. 36) 
The purchase of the residence was financed with a loan from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA),8 and repayment was guaranteed by the VA. (Tr. 37-38; GE 2-4) In July 2015, 
he began to fall behind on his mortgage payments. (Tr. 36) In February 2016, he stopped 
making payments. (Tr. 36) His credit reports show a zero balance, and the debt is 
resolved.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $740. Applicant said the 
debt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of the payment plan 
and payments after his hearing. (Tr. 38) 
 
                                            
8 The VA loan guarantee is as follows: “For loans between $45,000 and $144,000, the minimum 
guaranty amount is $22,500, with a maximum guaranty, of up to 40 percent of the loan up to $36,000, 
subject to the amount of entitlement a veteran has available.” As to whether the VA loss on a loan must be 
repaid, the VA explains:   
 
Must the loan be repaid? 
 
Yes. A VA guaranteed loan is not a gift. It must be repaid, just as you must repay any 
money you borrow. The VA guaranty, which protects the lender against loss, encourages 
the lender to make a loan with terms favorable to the veteran. But if you fail to make the 
payments you agreed to make, you may lose your home through foreclosure, and you and 
your family would probably lose all the time and money you had invested in it. If the lender 
does take a loss, VA must pay the guaranty to the lender, and the amount paid by VA must 
be repaid by you. If your loan closed on or after January 1, 1990, you will owe the 
Government in the event of a default only if there was fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith 
on your part. Factsheet VAP 26-4 is available on the VA website at

SOR ¶ 1.e alleges an account placed for collection for $465. Applicant said the 
debt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of the payment plan 
and payments after his hearing. (Tr. 39) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $150. The medical debt 
does not appear on his most recent credit report, and Applicant is credited with resolving 
this debt. (Tr. 39) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a judgment filed against Applicant in 2013, for $3,752. Court 
records indicate, on May 27, 2015, Applicant paid this debt in full. (Tr. 40, 44; SOR 
response at 3) This debt is resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a judgment filed against Applicant in 2011, for $815. The debt 
was satisfied in January 2014. (SOR response at 5) This debt is resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i allege a judgment filed against Applicant in 2011, for $13,967. On 
September 24, 2018, the creditor wrote this debt was paid. (Tr. 44; SOR response at 6) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $1,309. 
Applicant said the debt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of 
the payment plan and payments after his hearing. (Tr. 40-41) As of February 15, 2019, 
he had made payments of $523 towards this debt. (AE A at 7-9) 
 
After the hearing, I sent Applicant an email asking for payment plans and payments 
on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.j. (Tr. 41; AE B) He provided proof of a payment 
plan to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j. (AE A at 7-9)   
 
I also requested: (1) IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2010 to 2016; (2) proof of 
payments or status of state taxes for tax years 2010 to 2016; and (3) front and back of 
first page of state tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2016. (Tr. 41-42; AE B)9 I suggested 
he provide any other documentation relevant to his case. (Tr. 41-42; 47-48; AE A) The 
initial suspense was January 28, 2019, and I gave him an extension until February 27, 
2019. (AE B) 
 
Applicant requested information from the state tax authority about his taxes 
verbally, and he made a written request on February 25, 2019. (AE A at 11)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
                                            
9 An Applicant’s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated 
federal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 
(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).

access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s SOR alleges, and he admitted 
that he failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015. SOR ¶ 1.a 
alleges his federal income tax return for tax year 2016 was not timely filed; however, he 
is credited with timely filing his federal income tax return for tax year 2016. SOR ¶ 1.b 
alleges and the record establishes that he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax 
years 2010, 2011 and 2012. . SOR ¶ 1.b alleges his state income tax return for tax year 
2013 was not timely filed; however, he is credited with timely filing his state income tax 
return for tax year 2013. Several other debts became delinquent and judgments were 
entered against him. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions. 
 
Seven mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
 
8 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;10   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply to SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b; however, Applicant 
presented some important mitigating information. His spouse became unemployed, and 
she had medical debts resulting in a significant, unexpected reduction in his family’s 
                                            
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

income. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant’s control and caused or 
contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. He established payment plans for several 
debts; he paid three large judgments; the VA resolved his mortgage debt; his remaining 
unresolved delinquent debts total about $1,500, and are relatively insignificant. He is 
credited with mitigation of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.j.    
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 
2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017, and state tax returns for those same six tax years.11 
The DOHA Appeal Board has observed: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her

03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not 
alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant repeatedly failed to timely file his tax returns. The magnitude of his state 
tax debt is unclear. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed by various defense 
contractors since 1996. He is currently a logistician. He has no periods of unemployment 
over the previous 22 years. In 2008, he received an associate’s degree. He served in the 
Marine Corps from 1980 to 1996, and he received a medical discharge. He received a 60 
percent disability rating from the VA.  
 
When Applicant’s spouse was unable to work outside their home because of 
medical problems, the family income was significantly reduced and debts became 
delinquent. Applicant is credited with the reduction of his delinquent debts by paying three 
judgments. The VA paid his mortgage debt. He has shown enough financial progress to 
mitigate all of his non-tax delinquent SOR debts.  
 
Applicant’s history of failing to timely his federal tax returns for tax years 2010, 
2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017, and state tax returns for those same six tax years, 
raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. He may owe state income 
 
11 
                                         
 
taxes.12 When an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to 
consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS or a state 
generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin 
and complete making payments.13 The primary problem here is that Applicant has 
repeatedly been late filing his tax returns. He did not provide a good reason for not timely 
filing his federal and state income tax returns.  
 
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. 
Financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c through 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
  
                                            
12 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
13 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
