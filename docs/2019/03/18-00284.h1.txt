Decision

METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 25 June 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement
of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the2
SOR, requesting a decision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and
Appeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 3 February 2019, when Applicant’s
response to the FORM was due. Applicant provided no additional documents. DOHA
assigned the case to me 1 March 2019.
Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-4.1
DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,2
1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent
Directive 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017.

Findings of Fact
Applicant denied failing to timely file his state and Federal income tax returns as
alleged in the SOR, but admitted owing the Internal Revenue Service over $58,000 for
eight delinquent tax years. He is a 50-year-old senior administrative associate employed
by a U.S. defense contractor since January 2007. He has been employed in related
positions with two other defense contractors since October 1993. He has previously had
favorable background investigations in September 1998 and April 2006. This appears to
be a periodic reinvestigation of that clearance (Item 1).
Applicant disclosed his IRS tax debt for tax years 2006-2007 and 2009-2013 on
his January 2016 clearance application (Item 3), and discussed them at length during
his June 2017 interview with a Government investigator (Item 4). He stated that he
received a notice(s) in January 2016 about the delinquent tax years, made one
telephone call to the IRS that went unanswered, and thereafter made no effort to
contact the IRS to arrange a payment schedule. He attributed his tax debt to his not
adjusting his income tax withholding to reflect his income. However, he offered no
explanation for his failure to file his Federal tax returns on time. Applicant’s IRS tax
transcripts for the years in question show that the IRS filed tax liens against Applicant in
July 2017. Applicant’s Answer admits the tax debt and states only, without
corroboration, that he was working with the IRS and his bank to pay the debt off.
Applicant denied failing to timely file his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, and 2016-2017
state and Federal income tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.r). He admits owing the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) over $58,000 (SOR 1.s-1.aa, exclusive of 1.w—not used).
Applicant denied failing to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for nine
years. However, Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts for 2005-2016 (Item 4) show that
Applicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2005-2006, 2010-2013,
and 2016.  Record evidence does not confirm that Applicant failed to file his 20173
Federal income tax return (SOR 1.i) or his 2005-2007, 2010-2013, 2016-2017 state
income tax returns (SOR 1.j-1.r). Accordingly, I find those allegations for Applicant.
Applicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a
budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community
involvement.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
In fairness to Applicant, he filed for extensions for several years, and missed the extended filing deadlines3
by only days or weeks—compared to some years where he missed the filing deadlines by months or years.
Nevertheless, Applicant was assessed late filing fees and late payment fees.

factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, 
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his
Federal income tax returns for eight of twelve years between 2005 and 2016. The IRS
notified Applicant that he had delinquent taxes in January 2016, but Applicant took no
meaningful action to address his taxes. The IRS filed tax liens for these tax years in July
2017. Furthermore, Applicant documented no efforts to contact the IRS since his June
2017 interview5
The Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may 
demonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information.
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good
judgment and reliability required of persons granted access
to classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously
noted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their
legal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).4
¶19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a history5
of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or local income
tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required;
3
have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and
reliability required for access to classified information.”6
This is true whether the failure to file is willful  or attributed to the press of other7
circumstances.  As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of8
clearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal
or state income tax returns for 10 years. 
The filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal
obligation. Applicant’s . . . failure to have done so for many
years is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling
to follow other rules and regulations, such as those that
govern the handling of classified information. See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A
person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good
judgment and reliability required of those granted access to
classified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183
(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the
Judge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 19(g) explicitly
provides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that
can raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive
presumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct
under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s eligibility for a
clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App.
Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd.
Dec. 9, 2015).
Security concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an
Applicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case
his failure to timely file his Federal returns for at least eight years has created significant
tax debt that he has not addressed.
 Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His
failures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and the circumstances are
not demonstrated to be likely to recur.  Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his9

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years).
See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester).7
See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file).8
¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that9
it is unlikely to recur . . . 
4
failures to timely file and his subsequent failures to timely pay or make pay
arrangements were due to circumstances beyond his control, and it is clear that he has
not been responsible in addressing his taxes.10
 
Applicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and there are no clear
indications that his tax debt is being resolved.  He has documented no contacts with11
the IRS, and consequently cannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to
resolve his taxes.   Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might12
support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his
conduct. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.
 Formal Findings
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs a-h: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs i-r: For Applicant
Subparagraphs s-aa: Against Applicant
Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
