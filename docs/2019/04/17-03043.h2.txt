HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Appeal Board remanded the 
above captioned decision for inclusion of four documents in the record. The requested 
documents are provided. The decision denying Appellant’s access to classified 
information remains in effect, subject to the decision of the DOHA Appeal Board.   
History of the Case 
On November 18, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On January 16, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons to Applicant under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February

Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, 
establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position

me. On May 23, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 13, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was 
held as scheduled. On June 21, 2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript. 
 
On November 27, 2018, I issued a decision denying Applicant’s access to 
classified information.  On March 12, 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case 
to me and directed collection of four documents that Applicant presented during the 
hearing. At the hearing, the content of the four documents was summarized on the record, 
and the documents were returned to Applicant. The Appeal Board did not ask me to take 
any action beyond collection of the four documents.    
 
On March 14, 2019, I asked Applicant to provide copies of the exhibits referenced 
in the transcript at pages 18-21, and I provided a copy of the Appeal Board decision. 
(Remand Exhibit 1 with two attachments).  Applicant provided the requested documents, 
and they are as follows: 
 
(1) February 8, 2018 letter from bank creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d, indicating the balance 
owed is $1,141 and showing a payment of $315.79 (RE 2 (1 page)); 
 
(2) November 15, 2009 lease quote and two pages from an apartment lease for an 
apartment, signed by Applicant on November 15, 2009, with handwritten notes on page 
one (RE 3 (3 pages));  
 
(3) Lease for a different property from December 3, 2010, to December 4, 2011 
(RE 4 (14 pages)); and  
 
(4) Letter dated April 3, 2018, for a debt being collected by a creditor for a 
motorcycle, and the letter shows the non-SOR debt was paid in full or settled in full on 
March 21, 2018 (RE 4 (1 page)).  
 
Email correspondence indicates receipt of the four documents from Applicant. (RE 
6) The four documents are provided as directed by the Appeal Board. (RE 2-5)
