Decision 
___________ 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant has several unresolved debts including delinquent federal income taxes. 
He did not make sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. He refuted the 
allegation that he failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his May 11, 2016 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application 
(SCA) with intent to deceive. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) Personal conduct security 
concerns are refuted; however, financial considerations security concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.      
Statement of the Case 
On May 11, 2016, Applicant completed and signed an SCA. (GE 1) On April 3, 
2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a

clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations and personal 
conduct guidelines. 
 
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR. (HE 3) Applicant requested 
a hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-16) On June 27, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed. From July 13, 2018, to February 6, 2019, the case was assigned to other 
administrative judges, and on February 7, 2019, the case was transferred to me for 
administrative reasons. On July 16, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a notice scheduling Applicant’s hearing for August 17, 2018. (HE 1A) On 
December 31, 2018, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant’s hearing for January 
17, 2019. (HE 1B) The hearing was delayed at Applicant’s request for medical reasons. 
(HE 1C) On February 19, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
March 8, 2019. (HE 1D) The hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference.  
  
Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; 
there were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 
20-24; GE 1-7) On March 19, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing 
(Tr.). The record was initially scheduled to close on April 10, 2019. (Tr. 93-94, 101) I 
granted an extension at Applicant’s request until April 22, 2019. (HE 4) Applicant did not 
provide any post-hearing exhibits.    
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o because the 
allegations were duplicated elsewhere in the SOR. (Tr. 16) Applicant did not object, and 
I granted the motion. (Tr. 17) I made a notation on the SOR documenting my decision. 
(Tr. 17; HE 2) 
 
Applicant said he sent some materials to Department Counsel; however, the 
documents were not received. (Transcript (Tr.) 13) I asked Applicant to send them to 
Department Counsel and myself via email. (Tr. 13-14; HE 5) On April 20, 2019, I reminded 
Applicant that I had not received any documentation from him and that his suspense was 
on April 22, 2019. (HE 5) 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, 
and 1.v. (HE 3) Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old pilot and maintenance specialist for unmanned aerial 
vehicles (aircraft piloted by remote control or onboard computers) and drones. (Tr. 7-8, 
25) He has worked for the same government contractor since July 2014. (Tr. 25) He 
served in the Air Force for almost 28 years, and he honorably retired from the Air Force 
Reserve in 2008 as a master sergeant. (Tr. 8, 28) He served in Panama in Operation Just 
Cause, in Southwest Asia in Desert Shield/Desert Storm, in Kosovo, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan. (Tr. 8-9) His most recent deployments have been to Iraq and Africa. (Tr. 26)  
 
3 
                                         
 
In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 2003, he received a 
bachelor’s degree in management. (Tr. 7-8) In 1997, he married, and in 2014, he 
divorced. (Tr. 9-10) His children are ages 12 and 14. (Tr. 10)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant attributed his financial problems to his spouse’s failure to maintain his 
finances while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 19) She used illegal drugs. (Tr. 38) She 
failed to make payments on two houses, and they were lost to foreclosure. (Tr. 38) After 
they divorced in 2014, Applicant’s spouse did not pay her share of marital debts. Around 
the time of his divorce, he owed his brother $50,000 “and some other people.” (Tr. 29) 
Applicant was deployed in 2015 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) started 
garnishing his pay, and that is when he first learned he had problems with his federal 
income taxes. (Tr. 74) Applicant has been in the United States without being deployed 
overseas since March 2017. (Tr. 26) He was injured during his last deployment. (Tr. 26) 
His current annual salary is about $105,000. (Tr. 27) He has custody of his children; 
however, he does not receive any child support from his former spouse. (Tr. 29-30) 
 
 From May 2011 to May 2015, Applicant was not deployed, except for some brief 
trips overseas. (Tr. 91) He was employed in fracking for almost two years in the United 
States. (Tr. 31, 91) He was mostly deployed from May 2015 to March 2017. (Tr. 92)  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage account that went to foreclosure and resulted in a 
deficiency balance of $21,525. Applicant said he was overseas when his residence and 
a rental property were foreclosed. He denied that he owed anything, and he said he 
received a letter from the creditor indicating he did not owe the debt. (Tr. 40) Applicant’s 
March 6, 2018 Equifax credit report shows the $21,525 as a “past due” amount; the 
account became delinquent in 2012; and the property was sold. (GE 3) His December 31, 
2018 Equifax credit report does not list this debt. (GE 2)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f allege delinquent utility accounts for $1,671 and $551. 
Applicant said his wife paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f around 2010 or 2011. (Tr. 
41-42, 48-49) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.l , 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u, allege eight medical debts placed 
for collection for $1,125, $969, $759, $480, $81, $2,715, $917, and $711. SOR ¶¶ 1.k 
and 1.v allege delinquent medical debts for $84 and $93. Over the last five years, 
Applicant has received some medical treatments. Around 2015, he was taken by 
ambulance to a hospital for emergency treatment. (Tr. 43) He did not have documentation 
on the ten medical SOR debts, or if he did, he did not provide it. When he contacted the 
medical providers, they were unable to locate supporting documentation. (Tr. 45, 51, 68-
69) He wanted to determine whether the bills were for himself or his former spouse. (Tr. 
45-47, 58-59) He had medical insurance, and he wanted to determine whether the 
medical bills were his responsibility or the responsibility of his insurance. (Tr. 46-47, 58) 
He believed he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.v for $81 and $93; however, he was 
 
4 
                                         
 
unable to obtain documentation showing payment. (Tr. 59, 69) Applicant accepted 
responsibility for the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.s for $2,715, and the creditor offered to 
settle the debt for $735. (Tr. 66-67) He was waiting for the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.s to send 
him a settlement bill. (Tr. 67)  None of the 10 medical debts were shown on his December 
31, 2018 Equifax credit report. (Tr. 48; GE 2) Applicant is credited with resolving all of the 
medical debts except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.s, which he admitted was unresolved.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.m allege miscellaneous delinquent debts for $295, $245, 
$205, and $3,415. Applicant said he successfully disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Tr. 52-
54) He did not think the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j were legitimate debts, and he 
contacted the original creditors. (Tr. 55-57) He did not understand why the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.i and 1.j were on his credit report. (Tr. 55-57) Applicant said he did not owe the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.m because his former spouse improperly opened the account without his 
permission. (Tr. 60) He said the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.m is pursuing his former spouse for 
payment of the debt. (Tr. 61) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a mortgage account was foreclosed in 2011. Applicant said the 
foreclosure was actually in 2012. (Tr. 61) His spouse received a check from the creditor 
for $3,800. (Tr. 62) He blamed his spouse for not paying the mortgage while he was 
deployed. (Tr. 63-64) He believed the creditor owed him money from the sale of his 
residence. (Tr. 63) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.q, and 1.r allege two bank debts owed to the same bank, which were 
placed for collection for $8,624 and $4,577. Applicant contacted the creditor and learned 
there were two accounts; however, he believed one of them was his spouse’s 
responsibility. (Tr. 64-65) He believed the smaller debt was his responsibility. (Tr. 65) He 
did not provide any evidence of payments to address either debt. (Tr. 66) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.w alleges a charged-off bank debt for $17,797. Applicant contacted the 
creditor, and in December 2018, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $8,000. (Tr. 70-
71) Applicant accepted the settlement offer; however, he wanted to resolve the IRS debt 
first. (Tr. 72)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.x alleges a federal tax lien filed in November 2014 for $20,711. Applicant 
said his spouse lied to him about filing their tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2014. (Tr. 
19, 31, 73) She had a power of attorney. (Tr. 73) Applicant was “taking home $16,000 a 
month” while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 73) He deployed overseas, and the IRS 
began garnishing his pay. (Tr. 31) After he learned about his tax problems, he hired a tax 
company to work on his taxes. (Tr. 31) The tax company lost his documentation, and in 
2016, he stopped working with the tax company that lost his documentation. (Tr. 31, 76)  
 
In April 2018, Applicant sought the assistance of an expert in tax-exempt status 
and contractor taxes. (Tr. 19, 32, 38) He believed the IRS owed him refunds because 
some of his income overseas was tax exempt. (Tr. 32) The expert was unable to timely 
complete his tax returns because Applicant’s documentation was in storage. (Tr. 33) He 
described his tax situation as a “big mess” and asserted he is contacting his creditors to 
“clear everything up.” (Tr. 20, 34)  
 
5 
                                         
 
Applicant intended to file or refile his federal income tax returns for 2007 to 2014, 
and he plans to file his tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Tr. 35-36, 79) He filed tax 
returns for tax years 2007 to 2014 in the beginning of 2016. (Tr. 80) He also filed a tax 
return in 2015 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 79) He was reluctant to file his tax returns for tax 
years 2015, 2016, and 2017 because the IRS might take his refunds to address the 
$20,000 debt that Applicant believed was erroneous. (Tr. 37) He believed the IRS 
erroneously believed he made a profit on his home that was foreclosed. (Tr. 81) He said 
the IRS owed him $100,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 79) He wanted to file everything together. 
(Tr. 38, 75) 
 
I requested that Applicant provide the following documents: his IRS tax account 
transcripts;1 his DD Form 214; the IRS power of attorney he gave to his spouse to file his 
tax returns without his knowledge; proof of any payments, payment plans, or settlement 
negotiations relating to any SOR creditors; and a recent credit report from the three major 
credit reporting companies. (Tr. 93-94) I explained that he could also provide performance 
evaluations, awards, letters of recommendation, and any other documentation that he 
believed would help him obtain reinstatement of his security clearance. (Tr. 96) 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
Applicant’s May 11, 2016 SCA asked about his delinquent debts including debts 
in collections and charged-off debts in the previous seven years. Applicant denied that he 
had debts meeting this criteria; however, in the comments sections of his SCA he said 
his spouse “did not pay bills, caused all financial issues to include foreclosure, bad debts, 
not paying income taxes or filing income taxes for many years. I have taken steps to 
resolve all the financial issues and clear my bad credit.” (GE 1 at 33-34) He disclosed his 
delinquent tax debt of $21,000, for tax year 2014, and he said it was satisfied in April 
2016. (Tr. 89; GE 1 at 30) He said, “I have filed and [am] paying installments to correct 
the issue currently. I have an install[ment] agreement with the IRS and [am] completing 
them currently.” (GE 1 at 30) He said he was unaware of his delinquent debts when he 
completed his May 11, 2016 SCA. (Tr. 83) He had difficulty completing the security 
clearance application while deployed overseas due, in part, to problems with the Internet 
and saving the document. (Tr. 84)  
 
During Applicant’s June 1, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal 
subject interview (PSI), Applicant volunteered that his spouse failed to file and pay their 
federal income taxes in the amount of $21,000 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 92) He said he was 
making monthly payments to the IRS of $428, and his payments would be complete in 
two months. (Tr. 92; GE 7 at 6-7) He was unable to provide the status of numerous 
delinquent debts the OPM investigator asked him about during this PSI. (GE 7) 
 
  
                                            
1 An Applicant’s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated 
federal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 
(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018).

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
 
7 
                                         
 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax as required.” The SOR alleges and the record established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about 
the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Seven mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
 
8 
                                         
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
                                            
2 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply to all SOR allegations; however, Applicant 
presented some important mitigating information about his finances. Several 
circumstances that were partially or fully beyond his control adversely affected his 
finances or filing of tax returns: (1) he was deployed overseas to combat or conflict areas; 
(2) his spouse lied to him about paying debts and/or filing his tax returns; (3) his spouse 
did not pay his share of marital debts; (4) he was divorced in 2014; and (5) these multiple 
factors cumulatively caused his delinquent debts or distracted him from taking care of his 
finances.  
 
Applicant’s SOR indicates all several delinquent debts are in charged-off status on 
his credit report. A “charged-off debt” is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt 
owed to the creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor 
is required to change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt 
appears to be uncollectible, the creditor should change the status for accounting purposes 
from being an asset to charged-off status. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off 
status, a creditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, and the debtor may still pay 
or settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-off debts will be dropped from the debtor’s 
credit report. “[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not 
meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 
2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit 
Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven 
years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because 
of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.3 Debts may be dropped from a credit 
report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails 
to timely respond to a credit reporting company’s request for information, or when the 
debt has been charged off. “Mere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit reports 
is not reason to believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been satisfactorily 
resolved.” ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)).  
 
Applicant was overseas when his residence and a rental property were foreclosed. 
The foreclosures were his spouse’s fault because she did not make the mortgage 
payments. He indicated at least one foreclosure occurred in 2012, and from then on he 
was on clear notice that his spouse could not handle his finances. I have credited 
Applicant with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v. His spouse 
might be responsible for the debts; they might be the responsibility of his medical 
insurance; and/or they might be paid.

Applicant admitted responsibility for three substantial debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.r ($4,577), 
1.s ($2,715), and 1.w ($17,797). He said he had some settlement discussions with these 
creditors; however, he had not reached any settlements or made any payments. He did 
not make sufficient progress addressing these three debts.    
 
 Applicant did not establish that he had filed all required federal income tax 
returns.4 The DOHA Appeal Board has observed: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
                                            
4 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file some of his federal income tax returns. 
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant’s failure to timely file some of his federal income tax returns will not be considered except for the 
five purposes listed above.

analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant failed to timely file some of his federal income tax returns. It is unclear 
how much he owes the IRS. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
 
AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case, “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .”5 Applicant’s May 11, 2016 
SCA asked about his delinquent debts including debts in collections and charged-off 
debts in the previous seven years. He answered, “no,” and denied that he had debts 
meeting this criteria. His answers to these questions are incorrect. 
 
On his May 11, 2016 SCA in the comments sections, Applicant disclosed his 
financial problems, including a “foreclosure, bad debts, not paying income taxes or filing 
income taxes for many years.” Although he did not provide a list of his delinquent debts, 
he did highlight to security officials that he had significant financial problems. He honestly 
and sincerely believed his answers to questions on the SCA were accurate. He did not 
intend to deceive security officials about his financial predicament. He has refuted the 
allegation that he intentionally failed to disclose information, and he intended to deceive 
security officials about his finances. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted. 
 
  
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden 
of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)).

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in 
AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old pilot and maintenance specialist for unmanned aerial 
vehicles and drones. He served in the Air Force for almost 28 years, and he honorably 
retired from the Air Force Reserve in 2008 as a master sergeant. He served in Panama 
for Operation Just Cause, in Southwest Asia for Desert Shield/Desert Storm, in Kosovo, 
Iraq, Africa, and Afghanistan. In 2003, he received a bachelor’s degree in management. 
In 1997, he married, and in 2014, he divorced. He has custody of his children, who are 
ages 12 and 14.    
 
Five circumstances that were partially or fully beyond his control adversely affected 
his finances or filing of tax returns: (1) he was deployed overseas to combat or conflict 
areas; (2) his spouse lied to him about paying debts and/or filing his tax returns; (3) his 
spouse did not pay her share of marital debts after their divorce in 2014; (4) he was 
divorced in 2014; and (5) these multiple factors cumulatively caused his delinquent debts 
or distracted him from taking care of his finances. Applicant is credited with mitigation of 
most of the SOR debts.   
 
Most importantly, Applicant has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. He 
admitted a tax debt from taxes for tax year 2014 of over $20,000. The IRS garnished his 
pay. He revealed he had not filed his tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017.6 
When an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
                                            
6 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”).

the tax debt arose and the payment history on the tax debt.7 Applicant did not provide a 
good reason for failing to act more aggressively to address his delinquent debts and 
unfiled tax returns once he returned to the United States in March 2017.   
 
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. 
Personal conduct security concerns are refuted; however, financial considerations 
security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.r and 1.s:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.w and 1.x:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
  
                                            
7 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
