Decision 
___________ 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant has several unresolved debts including delinquent federal income taxes 
and local taxes. She did not make sufficient progress resolving her delinquent debts. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.      
Statement of the Case 
On July 27, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A 
the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 
2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On September 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On October 19, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
October 29, 2018, the case was assigned to me. Applicant was unavailable in December 
2018, and the case was delayed until January 2019. (HE 1A) On January 17, 2019, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling Applicant’s 
hearing for January 24, 2019. (HE 1B) The hearing was delayed due to snow at 
Applicant’s location. (HE 1C) On January 28, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, 
setting the hearing for February 8, 2019. (HE 1D) The hearing was held as scheduled 
using video teleconference.  
  
Department Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; 
there were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 
13, 17; GE 1-9) On February 21, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the 
hearing. The record initially closed on April 10, 2019. (Tr. 38-39) I granted an extension 
to April 17, 2019. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) B) Applicant provided six exhibits. (AE C-AE H)   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 
1.n. (HE 3) She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by 
her current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. (Tr. 5-6; GE 1) She has 
never served in the military. (Tr. 6) In 1987, she married, and her children are ages 24 
and 27. (Tr. 6) Her husband has driven a truck for several years, and he has been an 
owner-operator of a truck for the previous two years. (Tr. 7) 
 
In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 1986, she received a 
bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7-8) She has held a security 
clearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised security. (Tr. 
19)    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant attributed most of her financial problems, including her federal income 
tax debts, to her unemployment for about 30 months and her husband’s occasional 
unemployment. (Tr. 8-9, 22) She was unemployed from 2014 to 2016 and for several 
months in 2017 until August 2017. (Tr. 8-9) She was continuously employed from 1986 
to 2013 by two large defense contractors. (Tr. 8-9) Applicant and her husband have 
separate households in different states because of employment requirements, which 
results in additional expenses. (Tr. 26) Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial 
issues: 
 
 
3 
                                         
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c allege Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Her 2011 federal income tax return was filed 
three months late. (Tr. 27) She provided an IRS Form 1040 for her 2012 federal income 
tax return, and it is undated. (AE C) Her federal income tax transcript shows her 2016 
federal income tax return was timely filed. (AE D) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g allege Applicant owes federal income taxes totaling 
$40,828, for the following amounts and tax years: $13,695 for 2009; $4,674 for 2010; 
$4,050 for 2011; and $18,409 for 2014. She made payments to the IRS under an 
installment program from October 2015 to April 2017. (Tr. 22-23) She stopped making 
payments in April 2017, due to unemployment. (Tr. 23-24) Her payments under the 
installment agreement may also have been affected by her Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. 
(Tr. 25) She currently owes the IRS about $75,000. (Tr. 25) In July or August 2018, she 
contacted the IRS and attempted to establish another installment agreement; however, 
“it fell through.” (Tr. 25-26) Applicant did not know why it was not reestablished. (Tr. 26) 
Her most recent payment to the IRS under an installment agreement was in April 2017. 
(Tr. 27)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about September 
2016, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in about February 2017. Applicant completed 
financial counseling. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy court wanted her to pay $1,600 monthly, 
and she considered this amount to be unaffordable. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy was 
dismissed. (Tr. 29; GE 8)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant had a mortgage in the amount of $448,867, and her 
mortgage was foreclosed around 2016. For one year, Applicant made her mortgage 
payments using funds from her 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) During her unemployment, she 
was unable to make payments on her mortgage, and she had “to walk away.” (Tr. 31) 
She did not know how much the bank lost on the sale of her home. (Tr. 31) Her Chapter 
13 documentation filed in September 2016, indicated the value of her residence was 
$293,609, the amount of the mortgage debts were first mortgage: $417,160 and second 
mortgage: $24,800, and the unsecured portion of the debt was about $148,000. (GE 8 at 
17-18) As of May 3, 2017, her mortgage arrearage was $32,121. (GE 9 at 3) The 
mortgage debt is listed on her October 19, 2018 credit report as a foreclosure account 
with a last payment in February 2016, a balance of $448,867; however, the past due 
amount is zero. (GE 5) The current status of the two mortgage accounts is unspecified in 
her October 19, 2018 credit report. From the information submitted, I infer the foreclosure 
has been completed, and there is no proof of a deficiency. The debt is resolved.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges an account placed for collection for $80. Applicant said she paid 
this debt. (SOR response) The debt is resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a past-due debt of $693 on a vehicle loan for $17,892. Applicant 
indicated she was not current on her vehicle payments. (Tr. 31; AE A, email of Feb. 8, 
2019) She said she would provide evidence after the hearing showing the status of the 
debt; however, she did not provide it. (Tr. 32) 
 
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a delinquent debt owed to a city for $2,503; SOR ¶ 1.m alleges 
a delinquent debt owed to a county for $1,765; and SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a delinquent debt 
owed to a school district for $4,727. These three debts relate to her residence that was 
foreclosed. (Tr. 32-33) While those three debts may have been paid by the mortgage 
lender to ensure clear title for the transfer of the property, Applicant may still owe them. 
(Tr. 33) Applicant did not provide updated status information on the three debts. The three 
debts are unresolved. 
 
Applicant and her husband’s adjusted gross income on their 2015 federal income 
tax return was $175,760, and she indicated that part of this income included funds from 
her 401(k) account. (Tr. 36) She owed the IRS $22,000 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36-37)  
 
Applicant’s budget shows the following monthly amounts: gross income of 
$12,600; net income of $10,071; expenses of $5,801; debt payments of $1,579 (no 
payment to the IRS listed); and net remainder of $2,620. (AE E)  
 
A manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly 
motivated with exceptional potential. He is a retired Navy officer, and he supports 
reinstatement of her security clearance. (AE G) Another manager lauded her work 
performance, positive attitude, and effectiveness. (AE H) 
 
Applicant’s post-hearing statement concluded: 
 
I am not trying to avoid my responsibilities, and I am embarrassed that I am 
even in this position in the first place. To begin this process, I am trying to 
work with the IRS as well as a credit management company. I have the 
upmost respect for my Country and my company and would not put either 
at risk. Just as I love and respect my family and self that is how dearly I hold 
the responsibility of the clearance. I know if given the opportunity I can work 
on my finances and clear the concerns that this has set for the granting of 
the Security Clearance. (AE F) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
 
5 
                                         
 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
6 
                                         
 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax as required.” SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g allege, and Applicant admitted 
that she owes federal income taxes totaling about $40,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011 
and 2014. Her historical financial record shows a mortgage foreclosure, delinquent local 
taxes, delinquent vehicle loan, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed for failure to make 
payments. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
Seven mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;1   
 
                                            
1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; 
  
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions apply to all SOR allegations; however, Applicant 
presented some important mitigating information. Applicant and her spouse had multiple 
periods of unemployment, and she and her spouse currently have separate households. 
These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant’s control and caused or contributed 
to her financial problems. Applicant is credited with mitigating several SOR allegations. 
Almost all of her federal income tax returns were timely filed, and at present all of them 
are filed. SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are mitigated. The dismissal of her Chapter 13 and her 
mortgage foreclosure were caused by unemployment, and SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i are 
mitigated. She said she paid the debt for $80, and SOR ¶ 1.j is mitigated. 
 
Applicant owes about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes,2 and she has 
been employed since August 2017. Her tax debt is for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 
                                            
2 Applicant’s SOR alleges a federal income tax debt of $40,828 in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g. The 
SOR does not allege that she owes a total of about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 
in addition to those alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
 
8 
                                         
 
and 2015. She under withheld federal income taxes from her pay, and did not pay her 
federal income taxes in full when due. She has not been making payments to the IRS 
since August 2017, when she resumed employment.  
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is 
now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. 
Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course 
of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support 
approval of access to classified information).   
 
Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of progress resolving her delinquent 
federal income tax debt, her vehicle debt, and three local tax debts pertaining to her 
foreclosed residence. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
                                            
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)).  
Applicant’s federal income tax debt exceeding $40,828 for additional tax years not alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d 
through 1.g will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. 
 
9 
                                         
 
Applicant is 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by 
her current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. In 1987, she married, and 
her children are ages 24 and 27. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 
1986, she received a bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. She has held 
a security clearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised 
classified information.   
 
A manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly 
motivated with exceptional potential. Another manager lauded her work performance, 
positive attitude, and effectiveness. Her employment record supports reinstatement of her 
security clearance. 
 
When Applicant and her spouse were unemployed, her family income was 
significantly reduced and her debts became delinquent. Applicant and her husband had 
to arrange separate households because of their employment in different states. I have 
taken into consideration these circumstances beyond her control; however, she did not 
establish her financial responsibility once she obtained employment. She owed three local 
tax debts related to her foreclosed residence, and she did not establish resolution of the 
three debts or payment plans. She did not establish that her vehicle loan is current.  
 
Most importantly, Applicant has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. Her 
current tax debt totals about $75,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015.3 
When an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to consider how 
the tax debt arose and the payment history on the tax debt.4 She did not provide a good 
reason for failing to resume payments once she obtained employment in August 2017.

clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
4 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s
