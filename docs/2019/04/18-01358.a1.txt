ISCR Case No. 18-01358
APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
11, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On January 31, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant’s request
for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
 In her appeal brief, Applicant asks us to “take another look” at the Judge’s unfavorable
findings.  The Appeal Board does not conduct de novo reviews.  Her brief does not raise any
allegations of error on the part of the Judge.  While it does contain assertions that are not in the
record, including her intended actions regarding the unresolved debts, the Appeal Board is
prohibited from receiving or considering new evidence.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.   
  The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing
party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  Because Applicant has not made such an
allegation of error, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
