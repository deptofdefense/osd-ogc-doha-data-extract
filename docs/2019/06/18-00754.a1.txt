APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
March 23, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On April 11, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant’s request
for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge erred in his findings
of fact and (2) whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Consistent
with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact and Analysis
Applicant is married with two children.  He pays child support for one of them.  He served
honorably in the military and has held a security clearance since 1996.
The SOR alleged 20 delinquent debts, including judgments, that total about $104,000.  In his
response to the SOR, Applicant denied five of the debts because he was not familiar with them and
admitted the others.  The debts became delinquent between 2011 and 2017, and the judgments were
filed between 2012 and 2014.  
In 2013, Applicant experienced a reduction in his annual earning from $114,000 to $90,000 
when his employer, a defense contractor, changed.  In February 2014, he was laid off from his job,
began working in a temporary position in July, and was hired for his present position in August of
that year.  His current annual earnings are $105,000.   He attributed his financial problems to his pay
reduction in 2013 and his unemployment in 2014.   
Applicant paid one alleged debt through a garnishment in 2016 and 2017.  In 2018, he filed
Chapter 13 bankruptcy to prevent his home from being foreclosed.  He has made three payments
totaling about $2,100 under the bankruptcy.  His bankruptcy payments will increase over time to
more than $2,000 a month, which he currently cannot afford.  He anticipates that he will be able to
afford the payments once he successfully negotiates a home loan modification and renegotiates a new
Chapter 13 plan.  He believes all of the SOR debts are listed in his bankruptcy; however, one is not
listed.    
Applicant’s debts are numerous and ongoing.  Due to a lack of evidence showing actions to
address the debts before his bankruptcy, his debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability,
trustworthiness, and good judgment.  He encountered unforeseen events that negatively impacted
his financial situation, but failed to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
Despite filing bankruptcy, he has not shown his financial problems are under control.  In the whole-
person analysis, the Judge noted that “[h]aving been fully employed for more than four years, it is
reasonable to expect that Applicant would have taken more responsible and timely action to address
the listed debts.”  Decision at 7.  The Judge found against Applicant on all of the alleged debts.

Discussion
Applicant contends the Judge erred in various findings of facts.  Whenever a Judge’s findings
of fact are challenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e.,
“such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in
light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.”  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  In this case, Applicant, for example, points out that
the Judge stated in the synopsis of the decision that he was laid off for three months in 2014 when
he was actually laid off for six and a half months.  In the findings of fact, however, the Judge
accurately listed the time period that Applicant was unemployed as reflected in his security clearance
application (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) and his testimony (Tr. at 8, 30-31, and 34-35).  Applicant
also challenges the Judge’s finding that one of the SOR debts was not listed in his bankruptcy. 
Applicant is correct that the debt in question was listed in Schedule G - Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases of the bankruptcy petition.  Applicant further notes that he has a daughter and son
as opposed to the Judge’s finding that he has two daughters.  Although Applicant has pointed out
some errors, none of them merit any corrective action.  Even when considered collectively, the errors
are harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013)(An error is harmless
if it did not likely affect the outcome of the case). 
Applicant also requests that, if we decide to affirm the Judge’s unfavorable clearance
decision, we grant him a favorable public trust determination.  We have no authority to grant  that
request.  The Appeal Board neither has fact-finding authority nor authority to change the nature of
the adjudication below.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02394 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015).  We also
note that the adjudicative guidelines applied in this case are used whether a case is a security
clearance adjudication or public trust adjudication (i.e., a “sensitive position” adjudication).  See
Directive, Encl. 2 ¶¶ B, C, D.8, and E; and Encl. 2, App. A ¶ 1.  Additionally, Applicant requests that
we waive the one-year bar for reapplying for a public trust position following an adverse decision. 
See Directive ¶ E3.1.37.  We have no authority to waive the one-year reapplication bar.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 08-08606 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009).   
The balance of Applicant’s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge’s weighing
of the evidence.  These arguments, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the
evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-
00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). 
 
Applicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge
examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The
decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only
when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department of the Navy v.
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt concerning
personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national
security.”
