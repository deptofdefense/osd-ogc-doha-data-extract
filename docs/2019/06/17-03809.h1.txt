Decision 
______________ 
 
 
ROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant did not file her Federal or state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 
2016 in a timely manner. She did not submit sufficient evidence to show that all the returns 
have now been filed. She also owes considerable back taxes, and past-due medical bills. 
Resulting security concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied.  
 
 
Statement of Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on December 21, 2015. (Government Exhibit 1.) On January 17, 2018, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
 
 
2 
 
 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of 
Defense on June 8, 2017.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR, with an attachment, on February 22, 2018, and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was 
prepared to proceed on March 27, 2018. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2018. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 
11, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 13, 2018. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were 
admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Applicant 
Exhibits A through J, which were also admitted without objection. The record remained 
open at Applicant’s request for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant 
submitted Applicant Exhibits K through P in a timely manner. Department Counsel 
objected to the admission of Applicant Exhibits K, N, O, and P. That objection is overruled 
and the additional exhibits are all admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing 
(Tr.) on July 23, 2018. 
 
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 Applicant is 55 years old. She was widowed in 2012 and remarried in 2017. She 
is a high school graduate and has worked for her current employer since 2011. 
(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit C.)  
 
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) 
 
 The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance 
because she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially 
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i. She denied SOR allegations 1.c 
through 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.w.  
 
 With regard to all of her financial issues Applicant maintained that her late husband 
took care of the finances until his death. After his passing in 2012 Applicant stated that it 
took her over two years to begin resolving her financial issues. However, Applicant was 
often vague as to her knowledge of her past, or current, financial situation. (Tr. 42-43, 62-
65, 77-82.)  
  
 The SOR alleges in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b that Applicant failed to timely file 
her Federal and state tax returns for at least tax years 2010 through 2015. The SOR was 
amended at the hearing to add tax year 2016 in both allegations, in conformity with the 
evidence and in accordance with the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
paragraph E3.1.17. (Tr. 99-101.)

 In Section 26 of Applicant’s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) she admitted that she 
had not filed Federal or state taxes for tax years 2010 through 2014. Asked for the reason 
she stated, “late husband was the bookkeeper.”  She further stated that she was in the 
process of finding out what she owed, that she was obtaining tax help, and that back 
taxes were being paid through garnishment. 
 
 1.a. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her Federal tax returns in a timely 
manner from 2010 to at least 2015.  
 
 Documentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that she had not filed 
her 2010 through 2014 Federal tax returns as of November 2017. Applicant testified that 
she had prepared some of these returns by hand, however she also testified that she did 
not know if these returns had ever been filed. She also stated that one or more of her 
back tax returns may have been filed by a tax preparer she had hired. (Government 
Exhibit 3 at 13-19; Tr. 30, 63-64, 88-89.) 
 
 Documentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that her 2015 Federal 
tax return was filed August 15, 2016. Additional documentation provided by Applicant 
from her accountant showed that her 2016 Federal tax return was to be filed after March 
31, 2018. I find that both returns were filed late. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12; Applicant 
Exhibits K and M; Tr. 83-84.) 
 
 1.b. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state tax returns for at least tax 
years 2010 through 2015. Applicant stated at the hearing that she believed these returns 
had been filed. However, other than the 2016 state tax return, she submitted no evidence 
supporting her statement. (Government Exhibit 3 at 21; Applicant Exhibits K and M; Tr. 
35-36, 88-89.) 
 
 Applicant also testified that she had paid state back taxes through garnishment 
and did not owe any money to the state. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 36-38, 64-69.) 
 
 1.c. Applicant denied in her March 2018 Answer that she owed the Federal 
Government $11,108.44 for 2010 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from 
IRS.  
 
 Documentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received 
notice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 18-19.) 
 
 Applicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid 
through assignment of her tax refund. However, documentation from the IRS provided by 
Applicant after the hearing showed that she continued to owe $12,998.59 for that tax year. 
This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.)   
 
 1.d. Applicant denied in her Answer that she owed the Federal Government 
$10,488.53 for 2011 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from IRS.

 Documentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received 
notice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 16-17.) 
 
 Applicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid 
through assignment of her tax refund. However, documentation from the IRS provided by 
Applicant after the hearing showed that she continued to owe $12,996.69 for that tax year. 
This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.) 
 
 1.e.   Applicant denied in her Answer that she owed the Federal Government 
$40.89 for 2015 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from IRS.  
 
 Documentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received 
notice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12.) 
 
 Applicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid 
through assignment of her tax refund. Documentation from the IRS provided by Applicant 
after the hearing showed that she had no debt for that tax year. This debt is resolved. 
(Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.)1 
 
 1.f. Applicant admitted that she owed a medical creditor $457 for a past-due debt. 
Applicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing. Applicant testified that she 
hoped to pay this debt by the end of July 2018. She supplied no evidence that showed 
this debt had been paid or disputed after the hearing. It is not resolved. (Tr. 40-45, 73-
77.) 
 
 1.g. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $38 for a past-due debt. 
Applicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no 
longer showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence 
showing that her dispute had been accepted. She supplied no evidence that the debt had 
been paid or disputed. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.)  
 
 1.h. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $37 for a past-due debt. 
Applicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no 
longer showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence

hoped to pay this debt by the end of July 2018. She supplied no evidence that showed 
this debt had been paid or disputed after the hearing. It is not resolved. (Tr. 40-45, 73-
77.) 
                                                 
1 Applicant Exhibit P also showed that Applicant owed $4,412.03 in 2009 back taxes. The existence of this 
debt cannot be considered in Applicant’s case-in-chief. It can, however, be considered in determining 
mitigation.

Mitigation 
 
 Applicant has had a successful career over the years. She has received 
recognition for her work performance. (Applicant Exhibits B and E.) 
 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative judge 
must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions 
and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant’s national 
security eligibility. 
 
 These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire 
process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of 
variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires, “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or 
conjecture.  
 
 Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “The applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
 
 
8 
 
 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national 
security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. 
Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, “Any determination under 
this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest 
and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” 
See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information.) 
 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may 
be disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns, as required, for at least 
five years. She filed her returns late for tax years 2015 and 2016. She has a substantial 
Federal tax debt that is not yet resolved. In addition, there are substantial past-due 
 
 
9 
 
 
medical debts. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying 
conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. 
 
 The guideline includes several conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate the 
security concerns arising from Applicant’s substantial financial issues, including unpaid 
taxes, failure to timely file tax returns, and unpaid medical bills: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant’s unpaid Federal back taxes are still due and owing. She presented 
insufficient evidence to show that the medical debts have been successfully disputed, or 
paid. Applicant did not supply documentation to show that she has filed all of her past-
due tax returns. Nor did she submit any evidence to show that she has entered into a 
payment arrangement with the IRS or any state taxing authority, and is in compliance with 
such arrangements if she had filed tax returns and owed taxes. AG ¶ 20(a), (c), (d), and 
(g) do not apply. As stated, allegation 1.e is found for Applicant. 
 
The death of Applicant’s husband in 2012 undoubtedly caused some of Applicant’s 
financial issues. However, during the hearing she showed little understanding of her 
financial situation, was unclear as to the actions she had taken, and was vague about the 
 
 
10 
 
 
actions she would take in the future. The documentation she presented showed that her 
tax debts were not being resolved voluntarily, when they were resolved at all. Applicant 
did not present sufficient evidence to show that she acted responsibly after her husband’s 
passing. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. 
 
Applicant stated that she had disputed many of the medical debts online through 
the company that supplied her credit report. She did not have documentary evidence to 
support this statement. She did supply two letters disputing debts set forth in her latest 
credit report. She did not, however, marry those letters up with any of the debts on the 
SOR. Under the circumstances of this case, AG 20(e) does not apply. 
 
Applicant did not mitigate her tax and other financial issues. Guideline F is found 
against Applicant.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national 
security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
    
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide 
sufficient evidence to show that the back taxes and medical debts were being resolved, 
or that she had filed all of her tax returns. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or 
duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to 
Applicant’s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. She failed to meet 
her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial 
considerations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:         AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.w:   Against Applicant 
   
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility 
and a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
