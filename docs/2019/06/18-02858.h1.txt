Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial 
history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on February 26, 2018. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On December 13, 2018, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1  It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
2 
 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant answered the SOR on January 24, 2019, and requested a decision based on 
the written record without a hearing.   
 
On February 22, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on February 25, 2019. He was given 30 
days to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on March 6, 2019. Applicant did 
not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2019.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Included in the FORM were eight items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Exhibits 1 through 3 and 5 through 8 are admitted 
into evidence without objection. Exhibit 4 is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing 
Applicant’s interview that took place during the July 2018 background investigation. The 
ROI is not authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.3 Department 
Counsel’s written brief includes a prominent paragraph advising Applicant that the 
summary was not authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the 
authentication requirement. I am not, however, persuaded that a pro se applicant’s failure 
to respond to the FORM, which response is optional, equates to a knowing and voluntary 
waiver of the authentication requirement. The record does not demonstrate that Applicant 
understood the concepts of authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does not 
demonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving an objection to the 
admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, GE 4 is inadmissible, and I have not considered the 
information in the ROI.    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 63 years old, married, previously divorced with three children. 
Applicant had four children, but he lost a child in 2006. He served in the U. S. Army from 
1972 to 1987 and was honorably discharged. Applicant then earned an associate’s 
degree in 2000 and a bachelor’s degree in 2003. Since February 2017, he has been 
employed by a defense contractor. Before his current employment, Applicant was 
unemployed since November 2014.4  
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 7, 2017 apply here.  
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation 
which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
in April 2011 that was dismissed at his request in December 2011. The SOR also alleges 
that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2012 that was discharged in March 
2013.5 The SOR also alleges six delinquent debts totaling $16,712, of which $4,076 are 
medical debts.6 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations.7 
 
 In his Answer, Applicant explained that he filed the first bankruptcy (Chapter 13) in 
an effort to reduce his indebtedness. He requested a dismissal when he recognized that 
he could not keep up with the plan payments. Applicant filed the second bankruptcy 
(Chapter 7) following his inability to pay for his home and a new vehicle. He described a 
series of events that stressed his family’s finances during this period, including the loss 
of a child and the loss of his wife’s income when she moved to another state to care for 
her father.8 As noted, Applicant also was unemployed from November 2014 to February 
2017.  
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g.9 Applicant did not respond 
to SOR ¶ 1.h, which is a collection account supported by the evidence.10 Applicant did 
not provide any documentation to support the claims made in his Answer.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.

8 GE 2 ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.

duplicate, and SOR ¶ 1.f is being paid off (balance now $218 or less). Applicant correctly pointed out that 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged three medical debts in identical amounts with the same dates of last activity. The date 
of the report, date assigned, and date of balance are also identical. GE 5.

 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.13 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.14 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.15 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.16 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.17 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.18 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20 
 
Discussion  
 
Guideline F – Financial Considerations  
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,21 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness, financial problems, or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.22

21 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
22 AG ¶ 18.

The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might 
knowingly compromise classified information to obtain money or something 
else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, 
judgment, and other important qualities. A person who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in 
handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 
 
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). Applicant has 
produced no documentation to support his answers to the SOR debts. In fact, the 
evidence is contrary to his answers. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that 
applicants must present documentation to support their claims that debts have been 
resolved.23 I conclude that except for one SOR debt, none of the Guideline F mitigating 
conditions apply.24 
                                                          
23 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008) (it is reasonable for a judge to expect 
an applicant to present documentation about the satisfaction or other resolution of individual debts); ISCR 
Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). 
 
24 I find that GE 5 supports Applicant’s claim that SOR ¶ 1. d alleges duplicate debts. The correct debt 
should be $1,108, not thrice that amount. AG ¶ 20(e) applies.  
 
6 
 
 The record creates doubt about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.25 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:                 Against Applicant 
 
           Conclusion 
 
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
