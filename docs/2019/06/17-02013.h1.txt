LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for 
access to classified information. She did not provide sufficient evidence to explain and 
mitigate her history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against 
Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, 
on February 9, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance 
application. Thereafter, on July 10, 2017, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement 
of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the

national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is 
similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security 
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017. Her answers were mixed. She 
also requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on October 17, 2017. The hearing scheduled for 
January 23, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took 
place as rescheduled on April 17, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. 
Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-
5. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-F. No 
witnesses were called other than Applicant.  
  
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance for the first time. She is employed as a security guard for a company doing 
business in the defense industry. She has been so employed since November 2015.  
She has been steadily employed other than a period of unemployment from October 
2010 to August 2012.  
 
Applicant has married twice and has three minor children from her first marriage. 
She married the first time in October 2003 and divorced, after a separation, in January 
2014. She married the second time in July 2014 and separated in February 2017. A 
January 2014 child-support order required the father to provide medical insurance for 
the children, and the costs of medical, dental, and vision expenses not paid by 
insurance were shared equally between Applicant and the father.2 That was modified in 
March 2015 with Applicant and her ex-husband having joint legal custody of the three 
children; neither is obliged to pay the other child support; and she is responsible for 
providing medical, dental, and vision insurance for the minor children.3 
 
The SOR concerns a history of financial problems, including a joint Chapter 7 
bankruptcy case with her first husband ending in discharge of more than $250,000 in 
liabilities4 and 42 delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $57 to $6,341 for a total 
of approximately $33,751. The 42 delinquent accounts in the SOR consist of 2 unpaid 
judgments, 34 medical collection accounts, and 6 consumer accounts. Several of the 
medical collection accounts are for relatively small or minor amounts (e.g., $57). The 
SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions and credit reports from 2016 
and 2017.5 Other than the consumer account in SOR ¶ 1.dd for $618, the delinquent 
                                                          
2 Exhibit A.  
 
3 Exhibit A.  
 
4 Exhibit B.  
 
5 Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.

accounts have not been paid, settled, placed into a repayment arrangement, forgiven, 
cancelled, or otherwise resolved. The $618 consumer account was reduced to a 
judgment in March 2015, which was satisfied after making a series of payments for a 
total of $1,507 in December 2016.6 In addition, the delinquent consumer accounts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.l for $1,171 each are duplicates.7 And the delinquent consumer 
account for $238 in SOR ¶ 1.jj was included in the bankruptcy.8 
 
Concerning the 34 medical collection accounts, Applicant explained she denied 
the medical collection accounts in her answer to the SOR because she believes her first 
husband is responsible for those debts.9 She admitted that she had not “touched” the 
medical collection accounts, and she was unaware of how much medical debt she 
currently owes.10 She presented medical billing information addressed to her that shows 
she owes or is past due on more than $5,000.11 A review of the February 2016 credit 
report, which was obviously relied on in drafting the SOR, shows the medical collection 
accounts are described as individual accounts.12 
 
Overall, Applicant’s financial situation is less than stable. She described her 
financial situation as living paycheck to paycheck and her husband’s work history as 
“very rough.”13 She has no cash savings of any kind.14 In addition to the indebtedness 
discussed above, she owes approximately $15,291 in student loans, which are in 
forbearance.15 She stated that she is current with filing state and federal income tax 
returns.16

Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.17 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”18 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.20 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.21 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.22 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.23 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.24 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.25 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.26

Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .27 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute of provides 
evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.  
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial 
problems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two 
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  
 
                                                          
27 AG ¶ 18.

 Concerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant is in a difficult 
situation, and I certainly have empathy for her. But even if I set aside the numerous 
medical collection accounts, she still has two unpaid judgments for about $8,000 and 
some delinquent consumer debt for which she has done nothing to resolve. Her 
household income is now limited to what she earns due to her marital separation. She 
has no cash savings or financial reserve and no plan to address her delinquent debts. 
Given the facts and circumstances of her financial situation, it is likely that most of the 
indebtedness in the SOR will remain unpaid regardless of the outcome of this case. It is 
also likely that the financial strain she is under will increase when her student loans exit 
forbearance. Although I have credited Applicant for circumstances largely beyond her 
control (the marital difficulties in particular), her evidence is not sufficient to fully explain 
and mitigate the security concern stemming from her long-standing history of financial 
problems, which is ongoing and likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  
 
 Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice 
versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she has not met her 
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
