HEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. National 
security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 5, 2017. On 
October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant 
answered the SOR on November 13, 2018, and requested a hearing. 
 
I was assigned to the case on January 30, 2019. On April 1, 2019, I issued an 
order to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by April 29, 2019. On April 
8, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the 
hearing was scheduled for May 14, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  
 
Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted, without objection. 
Applicant testified, and Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through F were admitted, without 
objection. The record was held open until June 14, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit 
additional documentation, which is admitted as AE G through I, without objection. I 
received the transcript (Tr.) on May 29, 2019, and the record is closed.

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 50 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2012, and they 
have two young children. He received an associate’s degree in 2002, a bachelor’s degree 
in 2003, and he attended some courses toward a master’s degree. Applicant served in 
the U.S. Navy from 1988 until 1998, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant has 
worked for his current employer overseas in Kuwait as a force protection officer since 
September 2017. He held a top secret clearance while he was in the U.S. Navy, but has 
not held a clearance since approximately 1998. (GE 1; Tr. 12-15, 22-23) 
 
Applicant worked overseas as a defense contractor from 2009 until May 2013, 
when he was let go by his employer because he did not have a security clearance. He 
remained unemployed until May 2014. (Tr. 14-15, 27-28, 30) From May 2014 until 
September 2017, Applicant was underemployed and did not earn sufficient income to 
cover his expenses. Additionally, his wife was unemployed for a period of time. (Tr. 26, 
30-33, 57) Applicant took the job overseas, in part, to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 
27) Applicant has 12 unresolved SOR debts, totaling $32,800, and he resolved 7 SOR 
debts, totaling $17,762. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in 2014, and the outstanding 
balance is $16,889. Applicant testified that he has been making monthly payments of $66 
since November 2018; however, he did not provide documentation to support his claims. 
(GE 2 at 9; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 35-36, 39, 60) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a personal loan opened in 2013 and charged off in 2014 for $9,933. 
Applicant settled this debt in May 2019, shortly before the hearing. (GE 2 at 13; GE 3 at 
2; GE 4 at 4; AE A; Tr. 40-42) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a credit-card account that was opened in 2011 and charged off in 
2014 for $3,245. Applicant settled this debt in May 2019, shortly before the hearing. (GE 
2 at 13; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5; AE B; Tr. 42-43) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.h remain outstanding and unpaid. Applicant testified that he 
was planning to try to resolve several of these debts before the record closed, but did not 
provide documentation of payment or settlement. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 44-50, 61) 
 
 Applicant paid and resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j in May 2019. (AE C; AE G; Tr. 50-
51)  
 
 At the hearing, Applicant claimed he paid and resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.q, 
and 1.r, but he did not provide documentation to substantiate his claims. (Tr. 51-55, 58-
59) 
 
 Applicant settled SOR ¶ 1.m in May 2019. He paid SOR ¶ 1.p the day of the 
hearing, and he settled SOR ¶ 1.s in December 2018.  (AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 54-58) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.n remains unpaid and outstanding. (Tr. 62)

 In 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and his debts were 
discharged a few months later. This bankruptcy was related to a lawsuit that was filed 
against Applicant for a car accident that occurred while he was on active duty in the U.S. 
Navy. His insurance company went out of business, and Applicant was held responsible 
in the lawsuit. (GE 5; Tr. 68-70) 
 
In June 2008, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, to prevent his 
vehicle from being repossessed. The bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2010, due 
to Applicant’s failure to make payments according to the bankruptcy plan. (GE 6; Tr. 70-
72) 
 
Applicant provided an updated credit report, which reflected three new unalleged 
delinquent debts, totaling over $1,000. In his post-hearing submission, he provided 
documentation to show that he paid and resolved an additional unalleged debt. (AE H; 
AE I) Applicant does not follow a written budget, nor has he received credit counseling. 
At the time of the hearing he had $2,900 in savings to resolve his $32,800 in delinquent 
alleged debts. (Tr. 32-33, 60)  
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
 
4 
 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access 
to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying 
conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 AG ¶ 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable in this case: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
 
5 
 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
Applicant provided documentary evidence that he recently resolved 7 of the debts 
alleged in the SOR. However, he failed to provide substantiation to support his claims of 
other debt-resolution efforts. The majority of the alleged debts remain delinquent and 
outstanding. He receives partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
His two bankruptcy filings demonstrate that his financial issues have been an 
ongoing issue for a number of years, and they are not isolated to his 2013 to 2017 period 
of unemployment and underemployment. Applicant’s new unalleged debts further 
demonstrate that his financial issues are an ongoing and unresolved problem. Finally, 
Applicant failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts 
after his employment issues ended in 2017. Mitigation under AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b), was 
not established.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-
person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. 
He failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b – 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d – 1.h:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i – 1.j:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k – 1.l:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n – 1.o:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.p:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.q – 1.r:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.s:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.t:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United 
States to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
