Decision 
______________ 
MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial security 
concerns over her delinquent debts, including past-due state and federal income taxes, 
student loans, and other debts. Applicant’s eligibility for continued access to classified 
information is denied. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 26, 2015. On 
December 8, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations.1 
1 DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and  Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017.

 Applicant answered the SOR on January 5, 2018, and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on June 27, 2018. On August 7, 2018, a Notice of Hearing 
was issued scheduling the hearing for September 6, 2018. The hearing convened as 
scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which 
were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits 
(AE) A through G, which were admitted without objection.2 
 
At the end of the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR by adding a 
new allegation based on Applicant’s testimony. The motion was granted. I held the 
record open until October 8, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit additional 
documentation. On October 1, 2018. Applicant submitted one document, which was 
marked as AE H and admitted without objection. No additional documents were 
received by the time the record closed. The transcript was received on September 14, 
2018.  
 
Amendment to the SOR 
 
 Based on Applicant’s testimony, pursuant to DOD Directive ¶ E3.1.17, the 
Government moved to amend the SOR to add the following allegation:    
 
1.u.  You are indebted to the IRS for past-due taxes in the approximate 
amount of $6,000.3  
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c - 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.l - 1.o, and she denied SOR 
¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.p - 1.t. She admitted SOR ¶ 1.u during her hearing 
testimony. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough 
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 46 years old. She was married from 1997 to 2011. She has two 
children: a daughter, age 19, and a son, age 17. Both children live at home with her. 
Her daughter attends junior college and her son is a high school senior. Applicant 
remarried in May 2015 and divorced a year later, in February 2017. (Tr. 29-31; 91; AE 
D; GE 1) 
 
Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1997 to 1999. She was discharged 
honorably after she became pregnant with her first child. (Tr. 36; GE 1) She has earned 
a bachelor’s degree, and has had subsequent schooling. (Tr. 35-36)  
                                                          
2 AE A through AE C were attached to Applicant’s Answer.  
 
3 Tr. 47, 101-103. The motion was granted without objection. During the hearing, I erroneously referenced 
the new allegation as “SOR ¶ 1.m,” instead of by what came next in the sequence (SOR ¶ 1.u) as it is 
identified here.  
 
 
3 
 
 
Applicant has held a security clearance since 2004. She worked for defense 
contractor B from 2004 until November 2012. She then took a new contractor position, 
where she worked until she was furloughed, in July 2013. Over the next five years, she 
was employed from September 2013 to January 2014; laid off and unemployed until 
March 2014; employed again until November 2016; and laid off and unemployed until 
January 2017. Since then, she has been employed as a software developer for her 
current employer and clearance sponsor. She earns $100,000 annually. (Tr. 36-41, 94-
95; GE 1; AE D) 
 
 Applicant enrolled her children into private school from about 2011 to 2013, 
because they were being bullied in public school. (Tr. 92-94; AE D) In 2012, after 
leaving her job with defense contractor B, Applicant cashed out her 401(k), taking out 
about $25,000. She used the 401(k) money to finance her children’s tuition and to pay 
off several consumer debts. (Tr. 44-45) After 2013, Applicant returned her children to 
public school after she moved. She also was not able to afford private tuition. (Tr. 93) 
 
Applicant was not aware that an early withdrawal from her 401(k) caused tax 
consequences, so she did not pay taxes on that income at the time. SOR ¶ 1.a is a 
state tax lien issued in 2016 for $5,904. When Applicant learned of the tax debt, she 
contacted tax authorities and attempted to repay it, but she stopped making payments 
after she was laid off in late 2016. (Tr. 34, 43-45, 52) She did not make further 
repayment efforts until after the SOR. (Tr. 34, 52-53) 
 
AE F reflects payment plans for two state tax debts. One is for Applicant and her 
former spouse, though Applicant is responsible for it. Applicant is to pay about $67 a 
month for 12 months (on one $765 state tax debt). Under the second plan, Applicant is 
to pay $184 a month for 36 months (on another state tax debt, of about $6,000). The 
repayment agreements are in place as of August 15, 2018, but no evidence of 
payments was submitted. (Tr. 53-55; AE F) 
 
 In 2017, Applicant also learned that she owed federal taxes as a result of her 
early 401(k) withdrawal. She testified that she owed about $12,000 in federal income 
taxes. She said the IRS has kept about $6,000 of her federal refunds to resolve this 
debt. She has about $6,000 left to pay. (Tr. 44, 47-49) (SOR ¶ 1.u) Applicant did not 
provide any documentation to corroborate her testimony. She has not taken any other 
steps to repay her federal tax debt. 
 
Applicant asserted that the credit reports (GE 2, GE 3) contain incorrect 
information and that many of her debts are resolved, either because they are now in 
good standing, or because they no longer appear on her credit reports. (AE D) She said 
she contacted the credit bureaus to address the errors and dispute them. (Tr. 13, 32, 
107) She provided more recent credit reports which do not show all of the debts alleged. 
(AE A; AE G) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is a 2012 judgment against Applicant in favor of creditor M, a 
collection agency, for $1,577. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 3) Applicant asserted that the debt is 
 
4 
 
 
the same as SOR ¶ 1.s ($1,897), a past-due credit card account issued by Bank C and 
reported to collection agency M. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant denied both debts because they 
are no longer listed on her credit reports. (AE A; AE G) She also said she never had a 
credit card with Bank C. (Tr. 55-62)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($21,261), 1.d ($9,112), 1.e ($9,915), 1.l ($19,398), 1.m ($12,931), 
1.n ($9,372), and 1.o ($2,835) are past-due private student loan debts. As alleged, they 
total about $85,000. However, they are based on two separate credit reports, and some 
are duplicates. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e are the same debt. They are to the same creditor, 
were both opened in October 2011, and have almost identical account numbers. (GE 2 
at 4) SOR ¶ 1.l (listed on GE 3 at 3) is also a duplicate of debt ¶ 1.c. 
 
Applicant’s student loans were deferred for several years. They became 
delinquent during her divorce (2011-2012), though she only learned this later. (Tr. 33, 
63) She consolidated most of her student loans in 2015. (AE C; AE E) She documented 
that four of her loans (totaling about $34,600) were consolidated and “paid in full” by the 
U. S. Department of Education in 2015. (AE E) Applicant acknowledged that she still 
has to repay the loans, but now owes the federal government instead of private lenders. 
Applicant believes she owes between $40,000 and $60,000 overall. (Tr. 63-72)  
 
 All but one of Applicant’s student loans are again in deferment. She neglected to 
include one of her private loans (it is not clear which one) in consolidation. She intends 
to keep her student loans in deferment while her children are in school. She hopes to 
begin repayment in 2019 or 2020. (Tr. 69-74) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f ($3,242) is a charged-off debt relating to an old computer purchase. 
SOR ¶ 1.q ($1,714) is the same debt. The account numbers are the same, the creditors 
have the same initials and the two accounts are listed on separate credit reports. (GE 2 
at 4; GE 3 at 5) Applicant acknowledged that one of the debts is valid. She contacted 
the creditor to try to settle the debt, and intends to pay it. (Tr. 75-77) SOR ¶ 1.q is a 
duplicate, but SOR ¶ 1.f remains unresolved.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g ($68) is a charged-off debt to a credit union at a military base where 
Applicant used to work, from 2009 to 2013. It remains listed on her credit reports and is 
unpaid. (GE 2 at 4; AE A at 34; AE G at 1-2). Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 76-78) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($1,059) and 1.t ($1,081) are the same debt. The bank, the collection 
agency, and the account numbers are the same. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 78-82). SOR ¶ 1.t is a 
duplicate, but SOR ¶ 1.h remains unresolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,029) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. It became delinquent 
in about 2010. Applicant believes it has been paid. Applicant recently disputed the debt 
with credit bureaus. (Tr. 79-83; GE 2 at 11) She provided no corroborating 
documentation. The account remains unresolved.  
 
 
5 
 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j ($695) is an old, past-due utility bill, incurred when Applicant lived in 
another state during her first marriage. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant disputed it with the 
creditor, and asserts that it was removed from her credit report. (Tr. 82-87) She 
provided no corroborating documentation. The account remains unresolved.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k ($185) is a past-due debt to a cable company. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant 
said it is an old bill and that it has been paid. She said she contacted the cable company 
for verification. (Tr. 85-87) She provided no corroborating documentation. The account 
remains unresolved.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p ($1,824) is a past-due debt owed to a department store. Applicant 
denied the debt, which has been pending since 2010. She intends to pay it, but it 
remains unresolved. (Tr. 88; GE 3 at 5)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.r ($1,509) is a past-due credit card account issued by a large hardware 
store. (GE 3 at 5). It has been pending since 2010. Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 89) 
 
Applicant declared several delinquent debts on her SCA, in 2015, noting that 
many were due to her first divorce. She did little to try to resolve them until she received 
the SOR. This was due, in part, to her somewhat sporadic employment situation, but 
she also acknowledged that she did not pay attention to her finances. (Tr. 95-98; GE 1; 
AE D) Currently, Applicant is living paycheck-to-paycheck. She has little money saved. 
She pays $1,575 in rent. She bought a used car in 2017. She pays for some of her 
daughter’s college expenses. (Tr. 49-52) 
 
Applicant began a credit counseling program two months before the hearing. She 
learned about a well-known credit counselor’s “snowball” method of repayment (paying 
the smallest debt first, then the next smallest, and so on). She intends to address her 
debts one by one in this way, while also paying her tax debts, and then addressing her 
student loans at a later date. She also has learned how to keep a monthly budget. (Tr. 
88-90, 95-96, 108)  
 
 A co-worker and supervisor who hired Applicant for her current job attests that 
Applicant is a knowledgeable professional. She is also honest, trustworthy, hard-
wording, and loyal. She maintains confidentiality and has been entrusted to maintain 
access to sensitive information without issues. (AE H) 
 
Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the 
Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”4

 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
7 
 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  
 
Applicant incurred numerous delinquent debts, including state and federal 
income taxes, student loans, and other debts, as established by the credit reports in 
evidence. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG ¶ 19(f) also applies to Applicant’s tax debt. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.l, 1.q, and 1.t are duplicates of other debts in the record. They are not 
established.5 Applicant did not establish that SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.s are the same debt. 
 
Applicant was unwilling to pay many of her old debts because they were no 
longer listed on her credit reports. The mere fact that a debt is no longer listed on a 
recent credit does not establish that it is resolved, is no longer valid, or that Applicant is 
no longer responsible for it.6  AG ¶ 19(b) is also established.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
                                                          
5 When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative 
allegations should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 
2005) (same debt alleged twice). 
 
6 ISCR Case No. 14-003612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25. 2015)

downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
Applicant’s debts are due, in part, to conditions beyond her control, including her 
first divorce and occasional periods of unemployment in the last five years. The first 
prong of AG ¶ 20(b) therefore applies. However, for full credit, Applicant must show 
reasonable action under the circumstances.  
 
Applicant has significant unpaid student loans. She consolidated most of them 
several years ago, and they are no longer delinquent, since they are again deferred. 
However, their deferred status does not bar me from considering that Applicant has 
made no real effort to pay them over the years, and has no specific repayment plan in 
place now. I cannot consider them resolved.  
 
Applicant began to address her debts only when she received the SOR. The 
DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the timing of an applicant’s efforts to 
resolve debts is a relevant consideration. An applicant who resolves financial problems 
only when her clearance might be imperiled raises questions about her willingness to 
follow the rules governing classified information when her personal interests are not at 
stake.7  
 
Applicant’s recent income was impacted by her somewhat sporadic employment. 
However, she now earns a $100,000 annual salary. She has not shown that even the 
smallest of her debts have been paid. Her plan is to pay her smallest debts first, along 
with her taxes, and then to address her student loans. This is a reasonable plan. 
However, she has not taken sufficient steps towards implementing that plan to establish 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) or AG ¶ 20(d). Similarly, Applicant has only recently 
participated in credit counseling, and she has not shown that her debts are in control or 
are being resolved. AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. 
 
                                                          
7 ISCR Case No. 16-03187at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018); ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 
2015) 
 
 
9 
 
 
Applicant’s reliance on the fact that several of her debts are no longer listed on 
her credit reports is not sufficient to establish that they are no longer valid, have been 
resolved, or that she has a basis to dispute them. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. Even 
though many of Applicant’s debts are old, they are also ongoing. She did not establish 
that her debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. They continue to 
cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does 
not apply.  
 
Applicant incurred unforeseen tax debt after she made early withdrawals from 
her 401(k) to make ends meet during employment instability and to finance her 
children’s private school education for about two years, which she felt necessary for 
their well-being. She has a payment plan for her state tax debt, SOR ¶ 1.a, but did not 
document any payments towards it. She provided no documents to corroborate her 
testimony that SOR ¶ 1 u, her federal tax debt, is being resolved. She also has no 
payment plan in place to resolve that debt by means other than the IRS’s recapturing 
her tax refunds. AG ¶ 20(g) does not fully apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Applicant’s debts occurred, in part, due to conditions beyond her control. 
However, she only began to address her debts recently, and has not established a 
sufficient track record of steady payments, reasonable action, or financial stability to 
warrant a finding that the security concern over her debts is mitigated. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.k:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.m-1.p:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.q:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.r-1.s:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.t:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.u:    Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is denied.
