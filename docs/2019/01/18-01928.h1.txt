Decision 
______________ 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
Statement of the Case 
On October 9, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On August 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered 
individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or 
eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the 
case file. In a sworn statement, dated September 29, 2018, Applicant responded to the 
SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A 
complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to 
Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 22, 2018, 
and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the 
Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received 
the FORM on November 15, 2018. Applicant’s response was due on December 15, 2018. 
Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of January 28, 2019, he 
had not done so. The case was assigned to me on January 25, 2019.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted without comments nearly all of the 
factual allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j., 1.l. through 1.n., and 1.p.). 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving 
as a senior administrative logistics analyst with his current employer since October 2015. 
He was with the same employer, in a different position (warehouse administrator) and 
location from June 2013 until June 2014. A 1995 high school graduate, Applicant received 
a bachelor’s degree in 2017. He served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Navy from 
March 1996 until he was honorably discharged in January 2007. He was granted a top 
secret clearance in 2008. Applicant has never married. He has no children. 
 
Financial Considerations1 
 
During his enhanced subject interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2018, Applicant attributed his 
financial issues to his loss of employment in October 2012, when the contract on which 
he was working ended and he was laid off. He remained unemployed until June 2013. 
Following his layoff, while he was no longer receiving his normal wages, each month 
                                                          
1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in 
the following exhibits: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated October 10, 2017); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated 
January 24, 2018); Item 4 (Subject Contact, dated February 12, 2018); Item 5 (Combined Experian, 
TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated December 7, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated 
June 4, 2018).

Applicant received $600 in interest and dividends, $1,969.70 from the GI Bill, and a 
Veterans Affairs benefit of $113. Applicant used his savings and various credit cards to 
pay his bills, and he cashed out his 401(k), but failed to properly report his actions, 
resulting in increased state and federal taxes.2 It appears that most of his accounts 
became delinquent in 2015. Two other actions by Applicant have had a negative impact 
on his financial situation: in October 2014, he loaned a girlfriend $6,850, but she has 
refused to pay him back, and he does not anticipate her doing so; and in 2014, he leased 
a 2014 luxury sedan for a monthly payment of $599. 
 
On August 19, 2015, in a seemingly tactical effort to save his residence from 
foreclosure, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
He listed assets worth $356,712, including real property worth $348,127; liabilities worth 
$480,576. Included in that amount were $320,987 in secured claims ($285,012 mortgage 
lien, $35,975 for a vehicle lease; $17,629 in unsecured nonpriority claims ($1,256 in state 
taxes, and $16,373 in federal taxes); and $141,960 in unsecured nonpriority claims 
(various consumer accounts, including credit cards).3 At the time of his bankruptcy filing, 
he reported a net monthly income of $5,681;4 $5,116 in expenses; and a remainder of 
$565 available for saving or spending.5 By April 3, 2017, the bankruptcy trustee disbursed 
a total of $7,035, including $2,861 for administration expenses, and $4,174 to two 
creditors combined.6 No further disbursements were made to any of the remaining 
creditors because, on April 3, 2017, Applicant moved to dismiss his bankruptcy case. An 
order was issued dismissing the case and vacating all automatic stays and injunctions.7  
In addition to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 15 delinquent 
accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off as generally reflected by 
Applicant’s December 2017 or June 2018 credit reports. For the vast majority of the debts, 
Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to resolve the accounts since his 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy was cancelled.8 Those debts, most of which were charged off, 
totaling approximately $173,797, are described below: 
 (SOR ¶ 1.a., automobile lease for $28,835 on a vehicle that was repossessed); 
(SOR ¶ 1.b., credit card for $26,717); (SOR ¶ 1.c., credit card for $26,581); (SOR ¶ 1.d., 
credit card for $25,881); (SOR ¶ 1.e., credit card for $17,651); (SOR ¶ 1.f., credit card for 
$8,535); (SOR ¶ 1.g., credit card for $8,266);  (SOR ¶ 1.h., credit card for $5,678); (SOR

account for $604); (SOR ¶ 1.o., federal taxes for $16,373 of which there was a partial 
payment of $2,261.64 as part of the bankruptcy); and (SOR ¶ 1.p., state taxes for $1,256 
that was actually paid off as part of the bankruptcy).9  
Applicant claimed that his financial situation was “much better,” and while he has 
not made any efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, he is purportedly able to pay his 
current bills.10 He denied having received any financial counseling or debt consolidation 
services, but did indicate that he was looking into hiring a credit management company 
to assist him in paying his debts. However, as of January 2018, he had not yet done so.11 
Applicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt 
payments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary 
spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. In January 2018, the OPM 
investigator requested documentation associated with Applicant’s accounts, and in 
October 2018, Department Counsel noted that Applicant still had not provided any 
“documentary evidence proving that he has paid, is on a current repayment plan for, has 
settled, or otherwise resolved any of his delinquent or charged off accounts.” That status 
remains unchanged. Other than his general oral statements, Applicant offered no 
evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is now under 
control.  
Policies 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”12 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”13

to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely 
manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd.

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”14 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.15  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”16  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”17 Thus, nothing in this 
                                                          
14 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG 19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators; and 
 
                                                          
 
 
7 
                                      
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
  
In addition to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified 15 delinquent 
accounts, totaling approximately $173,797, which had been placed for collection or 
charged off. Other than the now-cancelled bankruptcy effort, 14 of those delinquent 
accounts remain unresolved, with Applicant making no effort to resolve them, despite 
being fully employed since June 2013. His frivolous or irresponsible spending resulted in 
making an unsecured $6,850 loan to a girlfriend and leasing a 2014 luxury vehicle for 
$599 per month. At the time he filed for bankruptcy, more in an effort to save his residence 
from foreclosure than to pay his debts, Applicant had a monthly remainder of $565 
available for saving or spending, yet he ignored delinquent debts of $67 and $604. He 
claimed having an inability to meet his financial obligations over a period of years, and it 
appears that his avoidance of his financial obligations is associated with somewhat limited 
funds, irresponsible spending, and an unwillingness to satisfy his debts. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(b), 19(c), 19(e), and 19(f) have been established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;18 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;19  
                                                          
18 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
19 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
 
8 
                                      
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
As to Applicant’s state tax debt, which was satisfied under the bankruptcy, AG ¶ 
20(g) applies. AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating 
conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” 
or that it is “unlikely to recur.” Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his one period 
of unemployment (October 2012 until June 2013), and insufficient funds to maintain his 
financial responsibilities. However, during his periods of unemployment, Applicant still 
had income from other sources. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant made 
any efforts, much less “good-faith” efforts, before or after he was interviewed by OPM; 
after the bankruptcy was dismissed in April 2017; before or after the SOR was issued in 
August 2018; or even after he was sent the FORM in October 2018, to: obtain financial 
counseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling 
service; dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or the creditors 
themselves; contact his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicate that payments 
had been made to his creditors.20  
An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed 
on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment 
and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate 
threat to his or her own interests.21 In this instance, to date, with the limited exception of 
the trustee’s payments regarding the state taxes and a portion of his federal tax debts, 
there is no evidence that any corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is 
no evidence to conclude that Applicant’s finances are under control. 
                                                          
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without 
further confirmed action, are insufficient.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
 
 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.22  
  
There is very little evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 41-year-
old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a senior administrative logistics analyst 
with his current employer since October 2015. He served in an enlisted capacity with the 
U.S. Navy from March 1996 until he was honorably discharged in January 2007. He was 
granted a top secret clearance in 2008. Because of a layoff, he was unemployed from 
October 2012 until June 2013. After filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in August 
2015, the bankruptcy trustee paid off Applicant’s state tax debt and a portion of his federal 
tax debt. 
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant had 15 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, 
                                                          
22 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-
3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
totaling $173,797. In an apparent tactical effort to save his residence from foreclosure, 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, but once the fear of foreclosure 
disappeared, he cancelled the bankruptcy in April 2017. Since the bankruptcy was 
dismissed nearly two years ago, Applicant has made no efforts to resolve his delinquent 
debts. Applicant has not obtained financial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, 
and he offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it 
is now under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:23 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely poor, if not non-existent, track record of 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding nearly all of the debts in his 
name. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
                                                          
23 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.n. and 1.p.:  For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o.:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
