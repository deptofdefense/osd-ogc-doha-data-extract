LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
Statement of the Case 
On December 21, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal 
conduct) and F (financial considerations). Department Counsel subsequently amended 
the SOR to withdraw the personal conduct allegations and SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e of the 
financial considerations allegations. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, 
2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 20, 2018, and 
reassigned to me on October 10, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 5, 2018, scheduling the hearing for 
October 11, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 
1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through R, which were admitted without objection.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 47-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of a Subchapter S 
corporation1 doing business as a defense contractor. He has been the primary owner of 
the company since 2002. He served in the U.S. military from 1989 until he was 
honorably discharged in 1991. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has 
held for many years. He has a bachelor’s degree, which was awarded in 1994, and a 
master’s degree, which he earned in 1995. He is married, but separated. He has four 
adult children.2 
 
 Applicant sold a division of his company in 2011. With the profit from the sale and 
his other income, his adjusted gross income for federal tax purposes was $5,942,002. 
His tax liability was $1,013,836. The IRS reported that $36,068 was withheld from his 
pay; $72,836 was credited from a previous tax period; $200,000 was paid in October 
2012; and the federal income tax return was filed in December 2012. Applicant paid 
another $200,000 in April 2013; $480 in October 2014; and $8,882 in October 2015. His 
tax refunds for 2013 and 2014 were withheld, and $1,021 and $26,542 were transferred 
to his 2011 tax debt in April 2015. The IRS issued a notice of intent to levy in November 
2014. As of June 2017, with penalties and interest, his tax liability for 2011 was 
$705,014. As of July 2018, it had increased to $724,332.3  
 
 Applicant also owes the IRS for tax year 2012, when he received the final 
payment for the sale of the division of his company. His adjusted gross income was 
$267,151. The IRS reported that he was credited with $2,000 and $862 in April 2013, 
but the IRS records do not indicate any other payments. His federal income tax return 
was filed in February 2015. As of June 2017, with penalties and interest, his tax liability 
for 2012 was $58,728. As of July 2018, it had increased to $60,757.4  
 
 Applicant stated that he had little choice but to sell the division of his company to 
a large company in 2011, as the large company would have taken their business away if 
he had not sold. The loss of the profitable division adversely affected Applicant’s 
company financially. He stated that his accountant advised him to pay the IRS 
$200,000, and that he would be able to receive credits from losses that would permit 
him to offset the taxes.5 
                                                          
1 S corporations are corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits 
through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-
through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual 
income tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. S 
corporations are responsible for tax on certain built-in gains and passive income at the entity level.

 Applicant was unable to offset the taxes for 2011 and 2012. He stated that he put 
much of the money that he received from the sale of the division back into the company. 
He used about $1.6 million from the sale to pay the mortgage loan on his house. He 
also paid credit cards and car loans, and he put about $200,000 away for his children’s 
college education.6  
 
 When he submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in 
September 2015, Applicant wrote that he was “[i]n process of putting payment plan in 
place with IRS.” In July 2017, he responded to DOD interrogatories and wrote that his 
accountants contacted the IRS to establish an installment agreement, but his case was 
awaiting assignment to a local IRS collection office. He wrote that “[o]nce the accounts 
are assigned, we will continue working with the IRS to establish an installment 
agreement.” He testified that his tax experts worked with the IRS for a payment plan, 
but one was never reached. He stated that he was unaware that he could pay the IRS 
outside of an established payment plan. Applicant stated that his company is doing 
better financially and has been awarded several contracts. He plans to pay his back 
taxes from the additional profits generated by his company.7  
 
 While his company was struggling, Applicant took on personal debt, and he 
personally guaranteed debt in order for his company to receive credit. A past-due credit 
card with a $38,688 balance was closed by the creditor and transferred to a collection 
company (SOR ¶ 1.c). A creditor obtained a judgment of $685,000 against Applicant’s 
company and Applicant personally in July 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.f). Another creditor obtained a 
judgment of $399,363 against Applicant and his company in July 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.g).8 
 
 Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the collection company 
handling the $38,688 debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. He agreed to pay $403 per month for 96 
months. He made the first payment under the plan on October 1, 2018.9 
 
 Applicant and his company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with 
the creditor holding the $685,000 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.f, and the judgment was 
vacated. Applicant’s company agreed to pay $20,000 per week until $479,000 was paid 
to the creditor. Applicant documented that from July 2018 to September 2018, the 
company made the ten $20,000 payments required under the settlement agreement.10 
 
 Applicant and his company settled the $399,363 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.g. They 
paid $109,898 to complete the settlement in June 2018.11

Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
                                                          
12 AE L-O.

Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant’s adjusted gross income was more than $6 million in 2011 and 2012, 
but he did not pay all his income taxes. His additional financial problems include 
judgments and a delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
6 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant settled the two judgments and has a payment plan to resolve his credit 
card debt. While he only documented one payment, and he still has more than seven 
years of payments, I believe he will continue with the plan. His non-tax debts are 
mitigated. 
 
 Applicant’s tax issues are another matter. He sold a division of his company in 
2011. His adjusted gross income was $5,942,002 in 2011 and $267,151 in 2012. He 
used about $1.6 million from the sale to pay the mortgage loan on his house. He also 
paid credit cards and car loans, and he put about $200,000 away for his children’s 
college education. Yet he did not pay all of his federal income taxes. As of July 2018, he 
owed $724,332 for 2011 and $60,757 for 2012. Applicant stated that he intends to pay 
his taxes. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of 
debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 
(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). 
 
 Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
abiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with 
rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR 
Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill 
his or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 
2018).  
 
There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s tax problems 
will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly 
under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his federal taxes. His tax 
issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
 
7 
 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of 
Applicant’s unpaid taxes are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s excellent 
character evidence. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d-1.e:   Withdrawn 
Subparagraphs 1.f-1.g:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   Withdrawn 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.c:   Withdrawn 
 
 
8 
 
Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
