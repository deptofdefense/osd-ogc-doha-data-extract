FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
Statement of the Case 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 26, 2017. On May 1, 
2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent 
her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The 
DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 
2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. 
Applicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 1, 2018, 
01/04/2019

and the case was assigned to me on September 11, 2018. On September 20, 2018, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for October 29, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or documentary 
evidence. I kept the record open until November 16, 2018, to enable her to submit 
documentary evidence. She did not submit any further evidence. DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on November 6, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 Applicant is a 44-year-old program analyst employed by a defense contractor 
since January 2017. She worked as a site manager from January 2005 to January 
2013, earning about $82,000 per year. She was laid off and unemployed from January 
2013 to April 2013. (GX 2 at 3.) She worked as an office assistant in a salvage yard 
from March to June 2014, earning about $10 per hour. She moved from another state to 
her current state of domicile in June 2014. She worked as a data analyst from June 
2014 to December 2015, earning about $72,000 per year. She worked as a program 
manager for a federal contractor from December 2015 to May 2016, earning about 
$82,000 per year, and she was laid off when this employer’s contracted ended. She was 
unemployed from June 2016 to January 2017, when she began her current 
employment. Her beginning salary with her current employer was $52,000, she received 
a raise to $55,000 per year about a month before the hearing. (Tr. 28-37.) She was 
cleared for a public trust position by another government agency in July 2014. 
 
 Applicant was enrolled in an online university from April 2007 to January 2012. 
She received an associate’s degree in April 2008 and a bachelor’s degree in business 
management in January 2012. She has about $175,000 in student loans, which are 
deferred and not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 61-62.) 
 
Applicant has never married. She has three children, ages 22, 20, and 15. She 
testified that she was entitled to child support for her two older children, but that their 
father was about $50,000 in arrears, and she has been unable to collect it. She was 
uncertain whether a court order requiring payment of the arrearage is still in effect. (Tr. 
59-60.) 
 
 The SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts totaling more than $57,000. The debts are 
reflected in credit reports from July 2017 and April 2018, and in court records submitted 
by Department Counsel. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the 
allegations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my 
findings of fact. The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized 
below. 
 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 SOR ¶ 1.a: unpaid rent placed for collection of $18,469. Applicant testified 
that part of this debt was reduced to judgment, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l, that the judgment 
was satisfied by garnishment, that she has a payment agreement for $370 per month on 
the remainder of the debt, and that the balance has been reduced to about $6,000. She 
submitted no documentary evidence to support her testimony. (Tr. 39-40.) The April 
2018 credit report reflects that the creditor for this debt is the same as the plaintiff in the 
judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l. The credit report reflects that this collection account is 
for attorney’s fees and “outstanding balance.” 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: car loan charged off for $12,785. Applicant voluntarily surrendered 
her car when she was unable to make the payments. She testified that she contacted 
the creditor, who offered to settle the debt for about $8,000, which she could not afford. 
The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 41.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $1,181. 
Applicant testified that this debt is for unreturned equipment and that she has disputed 
the debt and sent the creditor a copy of her receipt for the returned equipment. (Tr. 42.) 
She did not provide a copy of her receipt for the returned equipment or any other 
documentation of her dispute. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: credit card charged off for $589. Applicant testified that she does 
not have a payment plan for this debt, but that she sent two payments to the creditor, 
one for $137 and one for $50. She testified that she had documentation of her 
payments, but she did not submit anything to support her testimony. (Tr. 43.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j: four collection accounts from same creditor, 
two for $236 and two for $118. Applicant admitted these debts in her answer to the 
SOR, but at the hearing she testified that she was unable to identify them. (Tr. 44.) She 
testified that she disputed the debts online with the named creditor but did not receive a 
response. She did not submit any documentation of her dispute. (Tr. 65-66.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: satellite television placed for collection of $178. Applicant has 
taken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 45.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: collection account for $150. Applicant testified that this debt was 
an application fee for a rental property, but that she did not move into the property. She 
testified that she intended to pay the debt in full by the end of October 2018. (Tr. 46.) 
She has submitted no evidence of a payment. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k: utility bill placed for collection of $114. Applicant testified that she 
scheduled a payment on this debt but could not afford to make it. (Tr. 47-48.) The debt 
is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in January 2015 for $3,566. 
Applicant testified that this judgment was for part of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
 
4 
 
Court records reflect that she was evicted. (GX 5 at 1.) She testified that the judgment 
was satisfied, but she submitted no documentation to support her testimony. (Tr. 48.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in November 2015 for $4,450. 
Court records reflect that Applicant was evicted. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant admitted that the 
judgment is unsatisfied. (Tr. 51.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.n: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in January 2017 for $9,110. 
Applicant testified that she withheld the rent for an apartment because the landlord was 
unwilling to make necessary repairs. The court agreed with the landlord and Applicant 
was evicted. (GX 5 at 3.) She has not contacted the creditor or taken any action to 
resolve this debt. (Tr. 51-52.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o: cable bill referred for collection of $643. Applicant has not 
contacted the creditor or attempted to resolve this debt. (Tr. 52-53.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p: cellphone bill placed for collection of $2,133. Applicant has not 
contacted the creditor or attempted to resolve the debt. (Tr. 54.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u: medical bills placed for collection of $831, 
$234, $836, $297, and $386. Applicant testified that these medical bills were for her 
son, who has severe asthma. She testified that she was contacted by a collection agent 
(but not the collection agents alleged in the SOR) regarding three medical bills, that she 
made a payment agreement for a total of $549, and that the debts would be resolved 
after she makes two more payments. (Tr. 54-58.) She did not provide documentation of 
payment agreements or payments. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.v: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $469. Applicant 
testified that she contacted the creditor about a payment agreement, but the creditor 
insisted on payment in full. (Tr. 58.) The debt is not resolved. 
 
 Applicant’s annual salary equates to gross pay of about $4,580 per month. She 
provided no information about her about her take-home pay. Her monthly living 
expenses total about $1,312 (Tr. 60-61.) She has no savings or retirement accounts. 
She has never received financial counseling. (Tr. 64.)  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
 
5 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The documentary evidence reflects that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.l 
are the same debt. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). 
Accordingly, I will resolve SOR ¶ 1.l in Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing 
establish the following disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(a) “inability to satisfy debts”); 
AG ¶ 19(b) “unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”); and AG ¶ 
19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s unemployment from January to 
April 2013 and June 2016 to January 2017, and her drastic pay reduction from $82,000 
per year in May 2016 to $52,000 per year in January 2017 were conditions largely 
beyond her control. She testified about responsible efforts to resolve her delinquent 
debts, but she submitted no documentary evidence to support her testimony. When 
applicants claim to have taken actions to resolve delinquent debts, they are expected to 
present documentary evidence supporting their claims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 
at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). 
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant presented no documentary 
evidence of financial counseling, payment agreements, or payments on her delinquent 
debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that she disputed the 
telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, but she submitted no documentation of the 
dispute or the basis for it. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2  
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
 
8 
 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the 
evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.k:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.l:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.m-1.v:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
