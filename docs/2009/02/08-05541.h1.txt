Decision

HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant had an extensive history of drug abuse. He ended his drug abuse in 
November 2005. He had two alcohol-related incidents, the most recent was on January 
26, 2008. Applicant mitigated drug involvement security concerns; however, he failed to 
mitigate security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption because insufficient 
time has elapsed since his most recent incident. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied at this time. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 23, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (2007 SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE 1)). On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (Drug Involvement) and 
H (Alcohol Consumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On November 20, 2008, Applicant signed his SOR response, and he requested a 
hearing (GE 7). Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December 23, 2008, and 
the case was assigned to me that same day. At the hearing held on January 26, 2009, 
Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and 
Applicant offered three exhibits (Applicant’s Exhibit (AE A-C) (Tr. 68, 125-126). There 
were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 and AEs A-C (Tr. 19-20, 68, 126). 
Additionally, after the hearing Applicant provided one more exhibit, which was admitted 
without objection (AE D). I also admitted the hearing notice (GE 5), the SOR (GE 6), 
and Applicant’s SOR response (GE 7). I received the transcript on January 29, 2009.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two alcohol-related arrests in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, but contested some of the SOR information in SOR ¶ 1.a about his 
history of alcohol consumption (GE 7). He also admitted all of the drug-related SOR 
allegations (SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 2.e), and disclosed some mitigating information about his 
illegal drug use.2 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of 
fact.   
 
 Applicant is 25 years old and has worked for a government contractor since 
March 2007 as an electrical engineer (Tr. 98, 119, 120).3 He graduated from high 
school in June 2001 (Tr. 26, 119). He attended a state university from 2001 to 
December 2006, and did not live at home (Tr. 27-30, 119-120). He received a bachelor 
of science with a major in electrical engineering (Tr. 121). In February or March 2007, 
he returned home to live with his parents (Tr. 30, 37). He moved into an apartment in 
June 2008 and currently lives with a roommate (Tr. 30-31). He has never been married 
and does not have any children. 
 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. His response to SOR (GE 7) is the source for the facts in this 
section unless stated otherwise. 
 
2Department counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 2.b to conform with Applicant’s SOR 
response, as to the date Applicant’s drug use terminated. Applicant did not object, and I granted the 
motion (Tr. 15-16). I made the change to SOR ¶ 2.b and initialed the change (GE 6).  
 
3Applicant’s 2007 SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated 
otherwise.

Illegal Drug Use4 
 
 Applicant used marijuana about 25 times from about May 2000 to November 
2005 (Tr. 135, 137-138; SOR ¶ 1.a), cocaine about five times from about March 2004 to 
August 2005 (Tr. 136, 138-139; SOR ¶ 1.b), opium twice from about July 2003 to fall of 
2004 (Tr. 136, 139; SOR ¶ 1.c), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) once in 
about October 2002 (Tr. 137, 139; SOR ¶ 1.d), and psilocybin (mushrooms) once in 
December 2001 (Tr. 137, 139; SOR ¶ 1.e). He used illegal drugs primarily because he 
was curious about the effects of the drugs (Tr. 143-144). Most of the times when he 
used illegal drugs, he did not consume alcohol in combination with the illegal drugs (Tr. 
144-145).   
 
Applicant disclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application (Tr. 
99). He has not used any illegal drugs since November 2005 (Tr. 99, 152). He continues 
to associate with his friends who used illegal drugs in college (Tr. 140). In May of 2008, 
many of his drug-using friends and Applicant attended a wedding (Tr. 141). Applicant 
was unable to provide the frequency or recency of his contacts with his drug-using 
friends from college (Tr. 143). The person who gave Applicant the mushrooms is 
currently located in the same city where Applicant currently lives, and Applicant 
continues to associate with him (Tr. 156). He has never received counseling for drug 
abuse (Tr. 145). He does not intend to ever use illegal drugs again (Tr. 152). After the 
government contractor hired Applicant, he has not been tested for illegal drug use (Tr. 
156).   
 
Applicant signed a statement, agreeing that his clearance could be automatically 
revoked for any illegal drug use, and reiterated that he will not use any illegal drugs  in 
the future (AE D). 
  
Alcohol Consumption 
 
Applicant had two alcohol-related incidents (Tr. 131). The first was in February 
2007 and the later one was in January 2008. He last consumed alcohol on March 11, 
2008 (Tr. 131). He did not remember passing out from excessive alcohol consumption 
(Tr. 132). On multiple occasions, he consumed so much alcohol that he had a blackout 
and could not recall what occurred while he was drinking alcohol (Tr. 132). 
   
In February 2007, while Applicant was at university, he damaged the parking 
machine that accepts tokens (Tr. 32, 123-124). The campus police arrested Applicant 
and held him overnight (Tr. 32). The court required him to perform eight hours of 
community service and placed him on unsupervised probation for one year (Tr. 121). He 
had to inform authorities if he left the state, or had another incident (Tr. 124). He paid 
$1,300 in restitution for the property damage (Tr. 121). He was released from probation 
in November or December 2007 (Tr. 124). After this incident, he decreased his alcohol 
consumption, and stopped drinking alcohol during the week (Tr. 114). However, on the

7), unless otherwise stated.

weekends, every once in awhile, he would “cut loose” (Tr. 115).  On June 4, 2007, an 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant (GE 3 at 4-
8). Applicant described his outpatient alcohol counseling to the OPM investigator that he 
received after the February 2007 incident (GE 3 at 7). Applicant advised the OPM 
investigator, “Since subject’s treatment, subject has minimal use of alcohol, limiting it to 
one glass of beer/wine with dinner, one time per week” GE 3 at 7).  
 
On January 26, 2008, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated by 
alcohol (DuI) first offense and refusal to submit to a blood or breath-alcohol test (GE 7). 
He left a bar about 2:00 am, and arrived at his vehicle at about 3:45 am (Tr. 155). He 
refused the breath-alcohol test the police offered because he wanted to consult an 
attorney before submission to the test (Tr. 154). He did not think he was drunk when the 
police pulled him over (Tr. 155). He pleaded guilty to DuI first offense and his refusal to 
submit to a blood or breath-alcohol test was nolle prosequi (Tr. 122; GE 2 at 2; GE 7). 
The court sentenced him to 30 days incarceration (suspended), one year suspended 
license and a $300 fine (Tr. 102; GE 2 at 1; GE 7). His lawyer cost $2,500 (Tr. 113). 
The license suspension was converted to a restricted license (GE 2 at 1). The 
restrictions remain in effect from June 18, 2008, until March 9, 2009 (Tr. 123; GE 2 at 
1).  
 
The court ordered Applicant to attend 10 weeks of alcohol and safety action 
program (ASAP) (Tr. 102). The ASAP cost $400 or $450 (Tr. 102, 113). ASAP involves 
classes with about 30 other persons, most also have DuIs (Tr. 103). Each ASAP 
meeting included a breathalyzer test to determine whether there was any detectible 
alcohol use (Tr. 132-133). Applicant did not test positive for alcohol consumption on any 
of the ASAP breathalyzer tests (Tr. 134). He learned about the adverse effects of 
alcohol on the body and mind, as well as the legal and employment problems that result 
from alcohol abuse (Tr. 104). He learned about the terrible effects of drunk driving on 
defendants and victims and their families (Tr. 104-105). He signed ASAP’s agreement, 
which required him to abstain from alcohol consumption for one year (Tr. 103).  
 
The court required Applicant to attend one Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting 
per week for 16 weeks (Tr. 103, 109). After completing the AA sessions, he did not want 
to continue with the AA meetings because he thought some AA attendees became 
emotionally or socially dependent on AA (Tr. 109). He did not make it to the first step of 
the 12-step AA program (Tr. 154). Some AA attendees focus their social lives on AA 
meetings, and he did not need AA to resist alcohol consumption (Tr. 110). He preferred 
to attend classes or hear lecturers discuss the problems from alcohol consumption and 
to attend group counseling sessions (Tr. 111).   
 
Applicant is required to attend group counseling with an outside medical 
professional for 16 weeks (Tr. 103, 109). He attends group counseling, which involves 
discussion between about nine people who have had similar experiences with alcohol 
(Tr. 108). Applicant is required to pay the cost for a licensed professional counselor (H) 
with a M.S. degree. H provided three, one-on-one counseling sessions to date (Tr. 103, 
129-130). These sessions with H cost over $100 per hour (Tr. 128). He meets with H 
once a month, and most recently met with him in January 2009 (Tr. 129). H did not use

a breathalyzer test to check for alcohol use (Tr. 133). H evaluated Applicant and 
determined he met the criteria for “Alcohol Abuse, 305.00, according [to] the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, version IV-TR (DSM-IV-
TR)” (AE C). H noted the February 2007 and January 2008, alcohol-related incidents, 
and described Applicant’s therapeutic efforts; however, he concluded Applicants past 
drug use was not relevant and did not mention Applicant’s alcohol consumption to the 
degree to cause blackouts (AE C).  H concluded Applicant had a good prognosis and 
did not “present a safety risk for a security clearance” (AE C).       
 
Applicant recognized that consumption of even a small amount of alcohol can 
have adverse effects on a person’s driving (Tr. 105). Applicant found that abstaining 
from alcohol consumption was not difficult for him (Tr. 106). After March 2008, he 
oriented himself towards a more healthy lifestyle (Tr. 113). He runs and lifts weights and 
can now run 10 miles with no problem (Tr. 114). He feels fantastic (Tr. 114). He is more 
goal oriented, and ambitious (Tr. 115-116). He wants to continue his education and 
make other mental and educational self-improvements (Tr. 116-117).      
 
Applicant was very upset and sorry about the 2008 DuI arrest (Tr. 100). He knew 
his parents were very disappointed about his conduct (Tr. 100). The day after the police 
released him, he informed his supervisor and then his security officer of the 2008 DuI 
(Tr. 101). Because his family and employer are aware of his DuI, there is no possibility 
of extortion (Tr. 117). He described himself as honest, loyal, candid, trustworthy, and 
reliable (Tr. 117-119). He believed he has learned from his mistakes and would make 
correct decisions in the future (Tr. 118). After his probation ends in March 2009, he 
plans to engage in limited, responsible consumption of alcohol (Tr. 157). He would not 
drink any alcohol before driving (Tr. 157). If the choice was between alcohol 
consumption and his employment, he would permanently abstain from alcohol 
consumption (Tr. 158). 
  
Evidence of Lifestyle and Character 
 
Applicant’s roommate has known Applicant since they were freshman together in 
high school (Tr. 85). They did not attend the same college (Tr. 94). He is Applicant’s 
closest friend (Tr. 85). They have shared an apartment since June 14, 2008 (Tr. 85). He 
has alcohol in their apartment (Tr. 95). Prior to March 2008, he worried about 
Applicant’s excessive alcohol consumption (Tr. 86). He has observed Applicant 
intoxicated by alcohol, most recently around December 2006 (Tr. 90). In 2008, he and 
Applicant were at locations where alcohol was served or present and Applicant 
abstained from all alcohol consumption (Tr. 86, 91). Since December 2006, he has not 
seen Applicant consume illegal drugs (Tr. 86). After March 2008, Applicant has had a 
healthier lifestyle and extensively exercised and watched his diet (Tr. 87). Applicant is 
very disappointed in himself about the adverse effects of his alcohol abuse, and he 
recognized the necessity for lifestyle changes (Tr. 93-94). Applicant is the most 
trustworthy person he knows and should have a security clearance (Tr. 88).   
  
Applicant’s father (F) has two bachelors degrees, and is employed by the 
Department of Defense (DoD) (Tr. 25). F has 29 years of federal employment (Tr. 25). F 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
supervises a significant number of DoD employees with sensitive duties involving 
classified materials (Tr. 48-49, 53-54). Over his years of federal employment, F has held 
secret and top secret clearances (Tr. 25). Applicant told F about both incidents involving 
alcohol. In January 2008, Applicant called F from jail, when he was arrested for DuI (Tr. 
32-33). F thought Applicant drank too much alcohol on about six occasions before 
January 2008 (Tr. 33-36). F attended tailgate parties at Applicant’s state university after 
football games and observed many students consume excessive alcohol (Tr. 33-34). 
Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption after he began to work for the contractor 
because of the increased responsibility and the necessity to get up early in the morning 
for work (Tr. 37-38). F was not aware of Applicant’s illegal drug use until 2008, when it 
became an issue for Applicant’s security clearance (Tr. 38-40). Applicant has been 
around others consuming alcohol at weddings and at his parents’ residence when 
alcohol was available (Tr. 45-48). Despite the availability of alcohol, Applicant did not 
consume any alcohol (Tr. 45-48). F was adamant that Applicant’s alcohol consumption 
stopped on March 12, 2008 (Tr. 45-48). Applicant has changed since January 2008 (Tr. 
47-48). Applicant has lost 50 pounds and is in great physical shape (Tr. 48). F is well 
aware of the requirements for holding a security clearance and believes Applicant is 
sufficiently trustworthy and reliable to hold a clearance (Tr. 50-51). Applicant 
understands the consequences of future alcohol or drug-related problems and he is 
confident Applicant will not have future problems (Tr. 51-53).  
  
A senior engineering manager (M) was Applicant’s original hiring manager in 
March 2007, and supervised him for the next two years (Tr. 56-57, 75). Applicant told M 
about his 2007 alcohol-related arrest, and in January 2008 Applicant told M about his 
DuI almost immediately after the police arrested him (Tr. 58, 65). Applicant’s on-duty 
work performance was not affected by Applicant’s consumption of alcohol (Tr. 67). 
Applicant demonstrated initiative, ambition and drive, establishing himself as an 
exceptional employee (Tr. 61, 68, 69; AE A, B). For example, he made several 
impressive design reviews for customers that were superior to presentations made by 
much more senior employees (Tr. 73). As a result of Applicant’s diligence, he received a 
larger-than-average pay raise of six percent, and a promotion (Tr. 63, 69, 70). Applicant 
made valuable contributions to the Air Force and his employer (Tr. 63-64, 66-67). After 
the January 2008 DuI, Applicant went on a health and physical fitness program (Tr. 68). 
M discussed Applicant’s situation and performance with higher management and 
security, and they determined that Applicant should receive the company’s support (Tr. 
71-72). M considered Applicant to be honest, loyal, trustworthy and dedicated to the 
United States (Tr. 60, 65, 73). Applicant has learned from his mistakes and can be 
trusted with a security clearance (Tr. 74, 82-83).  If his clearance is revoked, it will affect 
the scope of duties; however, the company does not intend to immediately terminate his 
employment (Tr. 81-83).   
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guidelines G (Drug Involvement) and H (Alcohol Consumption) with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
 
9 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f) and 22(g) do not apply. He did not consume 
alcohol at work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. Applicant’s alcohol 
consumption problem was not diagnosed or evaluated by a qualified medical 
professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or by a licensed 
clinical social worker. (The government did not establish that Mr. H is a licensed clinical 
social worker, or other explicitly listed medical professional.) Although he received 
alcohol counseling in 2007, he did not receive the benefits of a significant alcohol 
treatment program. The alcohol counseling he received in 2007 was too superficial to 
apply AG ¶ 22(f).  He did not violate any court orders.  
 
Applicant had two alcohol-related incidents. In February 2007, he damaged 
college property while intoxicated, and in January 2008, he drove while intoxicated by 
alcohol. AG ¶ 22(a) applies. Currently, he does not habitually consume or engage in 
binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. However, when he was 
in college he did consume sufficient alcohol to have a blackout. Such behavior in 
college does constitute binge-alcohol consumption. AG ¶ 22(c) applies.  
 
  “Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 
F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden 
concerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant 
to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
AG ¶ 23(a) does not fully apply. On January 26, 2008, the police arrested 
Applicant for DuI first offense (SOR ¶ 1.a). On March 10, 2008, the court found 
Applicant guilty of DuI first Offense. This DuI is recent. It is his second alcohol-related 
arrest in two years. These two events are relatively frequent and recent. He stopped his 
alcohol consumption as required by his ASAP, and accordingly, he receives some credit 
because future alcohol-related offenses are less likely to recur. However, AG ¶ 23(a) 
cannot be fully applied because he continued to consume alcohol up until March 12, 
2008. He has abstained from alcohol consumption for less than a year, which is not a 
sufficient period of time under all the facts and circumstances.  
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many 
different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a 
fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.5  
 
AG ¶¶ 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not fully acknowledge or 
completely describe his history of alcohol consumption. He was very reluctant or unable 
to estimate the number of times he became so intoxicated in college that he had 
blackouts. Although he was not diagnosed as being alcohol dependent or being an 
alcoholic, a clearer, a more forthright description of his past alcohol use would have 
helped to erase lingering concerns. He may be minimizing his alcohol consumption 
problem, refusing to fully acknowledge the extent of his alcohol consumption “problem.” 
SOR ¶ 1.a generally describes his history of alcohol use; however, I specifically find 
Applicant’s clarifications of his history of alcohol use in his SOR response (GE 7) to be 
accurate. Although he completed an alcohol abuse treatment program after his 2008 
DuI, he stopped attending AA meetings. His history of alcohol problems, his failure to 
fully recognize and acknowledge his history of alcohol abuse, his most recent DuI, and 
his status as being on probation for his 2008 DuI until March 2009 exclude providing full 
mitigating credit under AG ¶ 23 at this time.  
 
Applicant’s current alcohol-related therapy is a positive development, showing 
that he continues to recognize an issue with overcoming his alcohol problems. 
However, after carefully consideration of the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption,6 I conclude his two alcohol-related incidents in the last two years, and his 
 
5See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   
 
6For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”  In ISCR Case No. 
 
11 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
DuI seven months after advising an OPM investigator that his alcohol consumption is 
minimal and he limits himself “to one glass of beer/wine with dinner, one time per week” 
GE 3 at 7) are significant factors against mitigating alcohol consumption concerns. His 
prediction that he will return to responsible alcohol consumption, when his probation 
ends in March 2009 also raises lesser security concerns in light of the diagnosis of 
alcohol abuse (as opposed to alcohol dependence). 
   
Drug Involvement 
 
AG ¶ 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: 
 
[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
AG ¶ 25 describes eight drug7 involvement-related conditions that could raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying 
conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular 
case: “any drug abuse,”8 and “illegal drug possession.”   
 
 
05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a 
clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most 
recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol consumption was 
not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 
04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three 
years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
7AG ¶ 24(a) defines “drugs” as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: 
 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other 
similar substances. 
 
Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. § 
812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled 
substances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) 
(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. 
2006) (ecstasy). Mushrooms are the street name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule I 
Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a 
plant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). 
Cocaine is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine). Opium is covered under 
Schedules I, II, III, and V as a controlled substance. See Sch. I(b) (listing opium deravatives); Sch. 
II(a)(1)-(3); Sch. III(d)(1), III(d)(3) and III(d)(7); Sch. V(5). See also National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
“Commonly Abused Drugs”, available at www.drugabuse.gov/ DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html (GE 4). 
 
8AG ¶ 24(b) defines “drug abuse” as “the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner 
that deviates from approved medical direction.” 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG ¶ 25 
are not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used 
marijuana about 25 times from about May 2000 to November 2005, cocaine about five 
times from about March 2004 to August 2005, opium twice from about July 2003 to the 
fall of 2004, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) once in about October 2002, 
and mushrooms (psilocybin) once in about December 2001. He used illegal drugs 
primarily because he was curious about the effects of the drugs. He possessed these 
illegal drugs before he used them. 
   
  AG ¶ 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating 
conditions:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  
 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance 
for any violation; 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; 
and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, 
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional. 
  
Security concerns can be mitigated based on AG ¶ 26(a) by showing that the 
drug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such 
circumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no “bright line” rules for 
determining when conduct is “recent.” The determination must be based “on a careful 
evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.” ISCR 
Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board 
determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last 
use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. 
If the evidence shows “a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of 
misconduct,” then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time 
 
13 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
demonstrates “changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of 
reform or rehabilitation.”9 
 
Applicant’s last drug use was on November 2005, about 50 months prior to his 
hearing. AG ¶ 26(a) fully applies. His overall illegal drug use lasted approximately five 
years (2000 to 2005), and involved numerous uses of illegal drugs such as marijuana, 
ecstasy, mushrooms, opium and cocaine. AG ¶ 26(a) applies because his past drug use 
does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.10 He 
has abstained from drug use for about 50 months, and he recognizes the adverse 
impact on his life of drug abuse. These actions create a reasonable certitude that he will 
continue to abstain from drug use. I am reasonably confident his illegal drug possession 
and use will not recur. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future and is subject 
to drug testing at his employment, confidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness 
and good judgment with respect to drug use is restored.   
 
AG ¶ 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse 
illegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using 
associates and contacts because most of them remain in the state where he attended 
university. He continues to associate with some drug users. He has broken his patterns 
of drug abuse, and he has changed his life with respect to illegal drug use. He has 
abstained from drug abuse for about 50 months. He provided “a signed statement of 
intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.” AG ¶ 26(b) applies.  
 
                                            
9 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the 
absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge 
excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug 
use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal 
Board stated:  
 
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage 
of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel 
the administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of 
law, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply 
that mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR 
Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a 
rational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at 
alcohol rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency 
analysis of an administrative judge stating: 
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of 
improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security 
clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year 
from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal 
purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
 
10In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an 
unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use 
was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. 
 
14 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
AG ¶¶ 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse 
prescription drugs. The marijuana, cocaine, opium, mushrooms, and ecstasy were never 
prescribed for him. He did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment 
program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements. 
  
In conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in November 2005, about 50 
months ago. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the 
adverse results from drug abuse.11 He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track 
record of no drug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to 
classified information.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
was relatively young and immature when he used illegal drugs from 2000 to 2005. He 
stopped using illegal drugs in 2005. In 2007, he frankly and candidly admitted his 
extensive history of drug use and his 2007 alcohol-related incident on his security 
clearance application. He subsequently admitted his drug use and 2007 alcohol-related 
incident to an OPM investigator. He was candid concerning all derogatory information in 
his response to DOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. He knows the 
consequences of drug abuse and excessive alcohol consumption. He completed ASAP, 
attended AA meetings and received one-on-one expert counseling, providing important 
mitigation of alcohol consumption concerns. Applicant significantly contributes to his 
company, the Air Force and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work 
 
11Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse 
health, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for 
remaining drug free. 
 
15 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would 
intentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance show 
substantial responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His company supports his 
continued access to classified information. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain 
from alcohol and drug use, and avoids future offenses, he will have future potential for 
access to classified information.  
 
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial.  
Applicant had a problem with drug abuse for five years. He has not received drug 
counseling or treatment. However, if his only problem had been his drug abuse, security 
concerns under the drug involvement guideline would be mitigated by his abstinence 
from drug abuse for more than 50 months because of the passage of time and other 
mitigating conditions. His two alcohol-related incidents in 2007 and January 2008 
cannot be mitigated at this time. His decisions to consume excessive amounts of 
alcohol were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be 
fully responsible for his conduct. These two offenses show a lack of judgment and a 
failure to abide by the law in the context of security requirements. Such conduct raises a 
serious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time. After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption. Drug involvement is mitigated 
because it is not recent.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”12 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. However, I 
recommend reinstatement of his clearance in one year if he continues to abstain from 
alcohol consumption, illegal drug use, and other criminal conduct.
