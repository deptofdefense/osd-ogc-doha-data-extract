LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and 
effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on August 12, 2008, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 9, 2008. 
DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 19, 2008, and the hearing was 
convened as scheduled on January 6, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 4, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, 
 
2 
 
called one witness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through M, which were received 
without objections. I granted Applicant’s request to keep the record open to submit 
additional information. Applicant submitted 26 pages of documents, which were marked 
AE N through R, and admitted without objections. Department Counsel’s memo is 
marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on 
January 26, 2009.  
 
Procedural Rulings 
 
I advised Applicant of his right under ¶ E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice 
before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has an 
associate’s degree. He served in the U.S. Army from 1978 until he accepted early 
retirement in 1995. He was married from 1980 to 1992. He is currently married, having 
remarried in 1994. He has no children, but has four adult stepchildren, ages 29 to 34.1  
 
 Applicant has had financial difficulties for a number of years. He was laid off work 
in 2002, and was unemployed for about a year. His wife also lost her job in 2002, and 
remained unemployed through 2006. She again lost her job in 2007, and is still 
unemployed. Applicant attempted to start his own business after he lost his job. He ran 
the business from 2002 through 2004. He did subcontracting for a larger company, and 
the company did not pay him the $40,000 owed to him. Ultimately the business was 
unsuccessful. He closed the business and sought other employment. He has deployed 
to Iraq on several occasions for his current employer.2 
 
The SOR lists seven delinquent debts. Applicant did not specifically admit or 
deny the allegations in his response to the SOR, but he discussed his efforts to address 
his financial problems. Individual debts and Applicant’s actions are addressed below. 
He also received financial counseling through his church.3  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $1,929 to a collection company, collecting 
on behalf of a cellular telephone services provider. The debt is listed on the two credit 
reports in evidence. Applicant let his adult stepdaughter use the cell phone and the bills 
went unpaid. He stated that he went to the services provider to attempt to resolve the 
debt, but they told him that their record did not show him with an account in their 
system, apparently because it was transferred or sold to the collection company. The

2 Tr. at 30, 34, 67-68; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1. 
 
3 Tr. at 60. 
 
3 
 
credit reports obtained by the Government and submitted in evidence provide almost no 
information about the identity of the collection company.4 
 
 A delinquent debt of $150 to a medical provider is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. The 
name of the creditor is not provided in the allegation and it is not listed on the credit 
reports in evidence. Applicant provided documentation that he paid several medical 
debts. This debt is considered resolved.5 
 
 Applicant voluntarily returned a car and a truck to the financial institutions that 
held his loans after he became unemployed. The credit reports in evidence list the 
balance owed on the loan on the car at $13,178, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. It is unclear 
from the reports whether this figure reflects the amount owed on the loan at the time of 
the voluntary repossession, or if it reflects the deficiency balance owed on the car after 
it was sold at auction. Applicant testified that the bank sent him a letter some time after 
the car was returned advising him that he owed about $13,000. The debt for the truck 
loan is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, as owed to a collection company. Applicant admitted that 
the holder of the truck loan sent him a bill for $10,615 after the truck was returned. This 
debt is not listed on the credit reports in evidence. Applicant stated that he will initiate 
contact with whoever holds this debt to attempt to resolve the debt.6 
 
 Applicant fell seriously behind on his mortgage payments, as alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d. In November 2007, he owed $19,752 in arrears. He entered into a stipulated 
repayment plan agreement with the mortgage company. He agreed to make payments 
of $2,967 every month, starting on December 15, 2007, and ending on February 15, 
2009. The payments of $2,967 included $1,650 to the loan and $1,317 to the arrears. 
Applicant made all the payments to the mortgage company’s satisfaction and the 
mortgage is now considered current.7  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a delinquent debt of $804 to a credit card company. The debt 
is not listed on the two credit reports in evidence. Applicant submitted a letter from the 
company that listed a balance on the account of $998.38 as of January 6, 2009. 
Applicant handwrote on the letter the figure $332.79. This figure represents one third of 
the amount owed. Applicant paid the creditor $332.79 on January 8, 2009. Applicant did 
not submit documentation or otherwise indicate that this was a settlement of the debt.8 
 
 Applicant admitted to owing the delinquent debt of $1,133 to a collection 
company on behalf of a credit card company, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. When Applicant 
responded to DOHA interrogatories, he submitted a letter dated April 28, 2008, from

another collection company. The letter listed the balance on the debt at $1,326. The 
company indicated that it would accept $828 in settlement of the debt. Applicant 
handwrote on the document that he called the company to make payment 
arrangements on the debt. Applicant did not make any payments before the hearing. He 
entered into a settlement agreement with the company on January 5, 2009, wherein the 
balance of $1,373 would be settled by a payment of $300 by January 10, 2009, followed 
by a $798 payment on February 10, 2009. Applicant made the $300 payment on 
January 8, 2008.9 
 
Applicant has had tax problems for many years. He stated his tax problems 
resulted from his first marriage. However, that marriage ended in 1994, and he 
continued to have tax problems for years thereafter. He entered into an agreement with 
the IRS in August 2007, to pay $750 per month for his and his current wife’s back taxes 
for tax years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005. He attempted to have the 
IRS remove his wife’s name from the tax debt. He submitted documentation that he 
made all 12 monthly payments in 2008. His monthly IRS statement of April 9, 2008, 
reflected balances for the joint account of $14,169 for tax year 1997; $11,988 for 1999; 
$4,023 for 2000; and $9,580 for other periods. The total amount owed to the IRS from 
that statement was $39,760. The IRS applied $9,229 from his wife’s 2007 refund for 
their 1999 tax debt. The IRS notice of May 12, 2008, reflected a balance of $2,759 for 
tax year 1999, after the $9,229 was applied. Taking into account the amount the IRS 
applied from the 2007 tax year refund and Applicant’s additional payments of $750 each 
month, Applicant and his wife’s current tax debt to the IRS is estimated at about 
$23,781.10 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
                                                          
9 Tr. at 39-44, 53-56; GE 2; AE J, O. 
 
10 Tr. at 62-67, 73-74; GE 2; AE A, K, Q; Applicant’s tax debts were not alleged as a basis for the 
denial of his security clearance in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. The tax 
debts will be considered in the application of mitigating conditions and in analyzing the “whole person.” 
 
5 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 
6 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant still owes a substantial amount of money on debts alleged in the SOR. 
His financial problems are recent and ongoing. AG ¶ 20(a) is not applicable. He 
attributed his financial problems to his and his wife’s unemployment. He also lost 
$40,000 in income as a subcontractor when his company was not paid on a contract. 
These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully applicable, there 
must be a correlation between the unforeseen circumstances and the person’s current 
financial problems. AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under 
the circumstances. Applicant’s financial problems started long before he became 
unemployed in 2002. He stated that his tax problems were related to his first marriage 
which ended in 1992. IRS documents reflect delinquent taxes for tax years 1996, 1997, 
1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005. To his credit, Applicant has been paying his back 
taxes for more than a year and has been addressing other debts. However, he still owes 
the IRS more than $22,000, in addition to his other unpaid delinquent debts. There is 
 
7 
 
insufficient information for a finding that he has acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable.   
 
Applicant has received financial counseling through his church. The payments of 
some of his debts are indications that the problem is in the process of being resolved. 
Because of the amount still owed, it has not yet reached the point of being a clear 
indication that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG ¶ 20(c) is partially 
applicable. Under the same rationale, he has not made sufficient payments on all his 
debts to constitute a good-faith effort to repay all his overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts. AG ¶ 20(d) is only applicable to his resolved debts. 
 
Applicant may have had difficulty in finding all the creditors holding his delinquent 
debts, but he did not dispute owing any of the underlying debts. AG ¶ 20(e) is not 
applicable.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s service to 
this country in the U.S. Army, and I also considered his deployments to Iraq as a 
defense contractor. However, his finances have been in disarray for a number of years. 
His finances were clearly damaged by his and his wife’s unemployment from 2002, and 
the failure of his business. However, that does not explain his tax problems. He stated 
that his tax problems resulted from his first marriage, but that marriage ended in 1994. 
IRS documents reflect delinquent taxes for seven tax years between 1996 and 2005. 
His tax liability at one point was more than $40,000. After his regular payments and the 
withholding of his wife’s refund for tax year 2007, the current federal tax debt is still 
more than $22,000. He also still owes a large amount on the debts in the SOR, as 
 
8 
 
addressed above. His ongoing financial issues cause me to question his judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
