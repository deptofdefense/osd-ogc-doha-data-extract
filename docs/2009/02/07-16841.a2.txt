The Board issued an Appeal Board Decision in this case on December 19, 2008.  On
February 5, 2009, Applicant submitted a request for reconsideration of this decision. 
The Board has inherent authority to entertain requests to reconsider its decisions.  However,
there is no right to reconsideration; the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise
its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0621 at 1-2 (App.
Bd. Nov. 23, 1999).  
In support of his request, Applicant contends that the Board erred in its interpretation of the
state anti-deficiency statute and that it erred in holding that the record did not support the Judge’s
favorable conclusion as to mitigation.    
The Board has considered Applicant’s motion and accompanying “Reply Brief. ”  Applicant
has failed to articulate a persuasive reason to conclude that, were the Board to reconsider its decision,
it would reach a different result.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.03-21012 (App. Bd. Sep. 20 2005).
Accordingly, Applicant’s request is DENIED.
