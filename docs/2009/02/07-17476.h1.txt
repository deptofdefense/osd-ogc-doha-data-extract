GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 18, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On August 21, 2008, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because her SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 2, 2008. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated September 29, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and 
the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard on December 8, 
2008. It was reassigned to me on January 5, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on January 29, 2009. 
 
During the hearing, eight Government exhibits and ten Applicant exhibits were 
received without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was 
received on February 4, 2009. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted eleven of the factual allegations 
in ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e. through 1.m. of the SOR.  She denied all other allegations.  
Department Counsel conceded the presence of satisfactory mitigation pertaining to ¶ 
1.d.1 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking 
to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. She was 
previously granted a SECRET clearance on two occasions.  The first time was in the 
early 1990s, but that clearance was lost when she was laid off.2 The second time was in 
September 1998,3 but that clearance was revoked in November 2004, due to financial 
reasons.4  She was married from 1984 until 1993,5 and has three children, born in 
1984, 1989, and 1990, respectively.6 Her three children, a son-in-law, and her former 
father-in-law, all presently reside with 7

Applicant has been gainfully employed by the same defense contractor, in a 
variety of positions, from November 1997 until the present, and currently serves as a 
material coordinator.8 
 
Applicant’s finances were apparently unremarkable until about 1994, when she 
was laid off and her former spouse stopped making the court-ordered child support 
payments.9 In an effort to improve her employment opportunities she enrolled in a 
vocational or technical school and completed her training in March 1995.10 Additionally, 
to reduce expenses, she moved back into her ex-spouse’s residence (he was a truck 
driver on the road) with their children, but that situation did not work out, so they 
eventually relocated in 1998.11 With the arrearage of over $30,000.00 in child support 
payments from her former spouse,12 and with mounting expenses, she experienced 
financial difficulties which resulted in accounts becoming delinquent and being “charged 
off” and/or placed for collection. In addition, Federal tax liens were placed on their 
property on several occasions. 
 
In 2004, when presented with a list of delinquent accounts by an investigator of 
the Defense Security Service, Applicant pledged to contact those creditors and arrange 
payment “when money becomes available.”13 She stated the money would have to 
come from the child support arrearage.14  
 
The SOR identified thirteen purportedly continuing delinquencies, but Applicant 
contends several of the accounts alleged have current payment arrangements; some 
have been satisfied or otherwise resolved; and some were not her responsibility. Her 
contentions have merit. The evidence and information offered by the Government 
consists, in large measure, of four credit reports and written and oral statements made 
by Applicant. Additional credit reports, along with financial records and correspondence 
with creditors, as well as official court records, were offered in support of Applicant’s 
case. The thirteen debts listed in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, 
according to the credit reports, financial records and correspondence with creditors, as 
well as Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:

SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. refer to joint credit cards or charge accounts which 
were either charged off (¶ 1.a.) or sent to collection (¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.).  Applicant paid off 
the account set forth in ¶ 1.b. in July 2008, by cashier’s check, a copy of which she was 
unable to furnish,15 and sent the remaining two creditors written inquiries in December 
2008.16  If and when they respond to her, she has acknowledged an intention to satisfy 
both accounts.17 None of the three accounts appear on her most current credit report.

SOR ¶ 1.d. refers to delinquent balances purportedly owed, as of September 4, 
1990, on a federal tax lien filed against Applicant and her ex-spouse by the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS), for insufficient or nonpayment of Federal income tax for the 
years 1985, 1987, and 1988.18 Applicant had filed a request with the IRS for Spousal 
Relief, dated April 12, 2000, stating that she and her ex-spouse were divorced in 1994, 
and since that date she had been the sole provider for her three children.19  
Nevertheless, the IRS filed the Notice of the lien in September 1990, and refiled the 
Notice in March 1995.20 The lien was not refiled by the last date for such refiling in June 
1999, and the lien was released. 
 
Applicant further contends the lien should have been solely against her ex-
spouse because the social security account number on the lien is that of her ex-spouse. 
On September 19, 2008, the IRS responded to her earlier status inquiry, and advised 
her that her federal income tax records indicate her Form 1040 accounts for the periods 
in question are “paid in full at this time.”21 None of the more recent credit reports in 
evidence includes an entry pertaining to this particular lien.  As noted above, 
Department Counsel conceded the presence of satisfactory mitigation pertaining to ¶ 
1.d. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. through 1.l. refer to medical or hospital charges for her children that 
went to collection between July 2001 and March 2006. Under the terms of her divorce, 
Applicant’s ex-spouse was financially responsible for the costs of health care insurance 
for the children, and both Applicant and her husband were to be equally responsible for 
any uninsured health care expenses.22 As noted above, her ex-spouse was in arrears 
for over $30,000.00 in child support payments, and he did not comply with the 
provisions of the decree.  Furthermore, it appears that her ex-spouse was incarcerated 
in a federal penitentiary, for unspecified reasons, from 2004 until at least June 2007.23 
Applicant paid off each of the delinquent accounts between November 2008 and 
January 2009.24

SOR ¶ 1.m. refers to a foreclosure on Applicant’s residence mortgage that 
occurred in April 2005.  When Applicant initially purchased her residence she was under 
the impression that she had obtained financing with a fixed monthly payment of 
$660.00.  After she had been in the house for three years, to her surprise, the monthly 
rate increased to $900.00.25 Although she attempted to work with the bank to refinance 
the loan to conditions more favorable to her, and within her ability to pay, the bank 
refused to work with her.  Eventually, in about April 2005, the bank foreclosed on the 
mortgage, but there was no deficiency owed by her.26  
 
Applicant has resided in another residence for the past three years. It is presently 
owner-financed, with her payments going toward her anticipated purchase of the 
property.  Once she receives clear title, she intends to refinance the property to pay off 
any continuing debts.27 
 
In September 2001, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement which 
reflected a gross monthly salary of $1,938.04; a net monthly income of $2,924.28; total 
monthly expenses of $2,757.00; and a balance of about $167.00 in discretionary funds 
available for her use.28  Her financial condition has substantially improved since then.  
On January 27, 2009, she completed another Personal Financial Statement, and it 
reflects a gross monthly salary of $3,503.91; a net monthly income of $2,961.30; total 
monthly expenses of $1,839.00; and a balance of about $1,122.30 in discretionary 
funds available for her use.29 As a “single mother” raising three children, and after 
“ignoring” her debts for a number of years because of her former financial situation,30 
despite having received no financial or credit counseling,31 the changed financial 
circumstances have allowed her to commence paying off her debts and enabled her to 
start saving money.32 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially

disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
Administrative Judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of 
a number of variables known as the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge 
must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has 
produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, 
the Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, 
explanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
Government’s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to 
suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
33 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. The evidence is sufficient to substantiate SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.m.  
 
The Government attributes substantial importance and credibility to entries in the 
various credit reports in evidence.34 I have reviewed them, and even with extensive 
experience in deciphering the entries, found them generally to be garbled and internally 
inconsistent, with minimum indicia of reliability. There is no indication as to the source(s) 
of the information appearing therein, for as one Equifax Credit Report states, the entries 
are derived from “public records or other information” without identifying the “other 
information.”35 It provides even less information about the sources of the derogatory 
financial information. The other individual or combined reports offer little additional 
useful information. 
 
For a substantial period of time, Applicant did experience an inability to keep up 
with the payments on her various accounts and mortgage.  Her financial condition was 
not caused by an extravagant lifestyle, substance abuse, or gambling issues, but was 
exacerbated because she was a single mother of three children trying to raise them 
without the child support her ex-spouse was required to pay. The arrearage of over 
$30,000.00 in child support would have enabled her to avoid her financial difficulties. 
Nevertheless, her delay until 2008-09 in commencing to pay off the delinquent balances 
constitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations. Her actions are sufficient to 
raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  
 
However, the issue pertaining to the federal tax lien is a different matter. The 
federal tax lien was filed against Applicant and her ex-spouse by the IRS in 1990, refiled 
34 The Appeal Boad has previously determined that credit reports are sufficient to establish a prima facie 
case that an Applicant has SOR-identifed delinquent debts that are of security concern.  ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at

once, and eventually released. The IRS indicated there is a zero balance. The evidence 
of record, Applicant’s contentions, and Department Counsel’s concession that the 
allegation has been mitigated, in the absence of any contrary evidence, satisfies me 
that this allegation has been mitigated.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s 
inability to make her monthly payments on various accounts, and the absence of actual 
payments or repayment arrangements until 2008-09, is the single most potentially 
troublesome issue. While Applicant’s three children are now over 21 and she is no 
longer responsible for supporting them, they do continue to reside with her, along with 
one son-in-law and her former father-in-law. Also, Applicant’s improved financial 
condition, the fact that she has already paid off all but two accounts, and the wisdom, 
maturity, and greater understanding of her financial responsibilities, makes it less likely 
that the behavior will recur. I find AG ¶ 20(a) applies in this case.  
 
Likewise, under AG ¶ 20(b), when “the conditions that resulted in the financial 
problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,” there may be potential 
mitigation.  Applicant was impacted by not only one of those conditions, but by three of 
them almost simultaneously. She was laid off, encountered several medical 
emergencies, and went through a separation and eventual divorce, all of which took a 
toll on her ability to avoid financial difficulties.  Added to that cornucopia of contributing 
difficulties was her ex-spouse’s failure or refusal to comply with his court-mandated 
child support responsibilities.  In the absence of those problems, her financial difficulties 
might never have occurred.  Accordingly, I find AG ¶ 20(b) applies in this case. 
 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ 
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, the first section of AG & 20(c) 
is not in issue for there is no evidence of Applicant having received counseling for 
financial issues. However, there are clear indications that her financial issues have been 
resolved or are under control.  Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@36 Applicant generally has a monthly balance of about $1,122.30 in 
36 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally

discretionary funds available for her use. She previously paid off nine of the alleged 
debts; has mitigated the federal tax issue; relinquished her foreclosed residence to the 
creditor, with no deficiency owed by her; is engaged in purchasing her current 
residence; and has taken the first steps toward resolving the two remaining delinquent 
accounts identified in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.c.), with the clear intention of satisfying 
any remaining balances. Her actions in addressing her debts indicate good-faith efforts 
on her part as well as showing clear indications the problem is now largely under 
control.  I find AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply in this case. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has taken affirmative 
action and made substantial good-faith efforts to pay off or resolve her legitimate 
delinquent debts, including those raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it 
is the Government’s contentions that she still has two outstanding debts identified in the 
SOR, those debts are being addressed by her. Thus, these debts cannot be sources of 
improper pressure or duress.  (See AG & 2(a)(8).)  
 
Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are resolved; it is whether 
her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security 
clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put 
Applicant’s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of 
 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.37 Considering her continuing good-faith efforts, the nature and 
circumstances behind some of the debts, the child support arrearage of her ex-spouse, 
and her current financial condition, her past financial situation is insufficient to raise 
continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
