Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  
(e-QIP) on June 1, 2007. On July 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for 
Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On August 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
November 14, 2008. The case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008. On 
December 3, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for 
December 19, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered five 
exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 5. The Applicant 
testified. The record was held open until January 9, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit 
 
2 
 
 
documents.  No documents were submitted. The transcript was received on December 
29, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations and denies all of the allegations under Guideline 
E, Personal Conduct.  
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor 
seeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with his company since October 
2007. He has a high school diploma, some college and technical school credit. He is 
separated from his wife and has a son, age 13. (Tr at 5, 19-20; Gov 1.)  
 
On June 1, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant 
answered “No” in response to question 28(a) “In the last 7 years, have you been over 
180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” He answered “Yes” in response to question 28(b) 
“Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” He listed a $246.50 debt 
owed to an auto finance company. He did not list any other delinquent debts. (Gov 1.)  
 
A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has the following 
delinquent accounts: a $2,263 judgment entered against Applicant in 1997 (SOR ¶ 1.a: 
Gov 2 at 3); a $53 cable television bill placed for collection in August 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.b: 
Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $30 medical account placed for collection in September 2005 
(SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 4 at 2); a $635 account placed for collection in September 2005 (SOR 
¶ 1.d: Gov 2 at 14; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $2,360 account placed for collection in 
November 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 6); a $1,637 electronic 
store account placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 4 at 3); a $450 
judgment for a medical account entered against Applicant in January 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.g: 
Gov 2 at 4); and a $940 account placed for collection in January 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 
4 at 3). 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: an $830 account placed for collection in May 
2006 (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 4 at 3); a $945 credit card account placed for collection in June 
2006 (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3); a $1,364 jewelry 
store account placed for collection in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.k: Gov 2 at 12; Gov 3 at 5; 
Gov 4 at 2-3; Gov 5 at 10); a $100 credit union account for collection in August 2006 
(SOR ¶ 1.l: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 4); a $1,345 credit card 
account placed for collection in December 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.m: Gov 2 at 13; Gov 3 at 6; 
Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 10); a $3,488 account that is delinquent since January 2007 (SOR 
¶ 1.n: Gov 2 at 3; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 4); and a $460 account placed for collection in 
March 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.o: Gov 2 at 14; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 5, 11).

Additional delinquent debts include: a $2,370 account placed for collection in 
May 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.p: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 8-9); a $1,381 account placed 
for collection in May 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.q: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3, 10, 12); a $1,681 account 
owed after a vehicle was repossessed in May 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.r: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 5;  
Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 8); a $350 medical account placed for collection in May 2007 (SOR 
¶ 1.s: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 10); a $266 medical account placed for collection in June 
2007 (SOR ¶ 1.t: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account placed for collection 
in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.u: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account placed for 
collection in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.v: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical account 
placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.w: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 11); a $150 medical 
account placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.x: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 at 12); and a 
$407 medical account placed for collection in June 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.u: Gov 3 at 6; Gov 5 
at 12). 
 
Applicant experienced financial problems due to several periods of 
unemployment or underemployment. He was unemployed in 1995. He was unemployed 
between December 2006 and April 2007. He was unemployed between August 2007 to 
October 2007. (Tr at 21.)  
 
Applicant and his wife are in the process of a divorce.  They separated two years 
ago. Applicant has custody of his son. His son was diagnosed with a mental disorder. 
He was in a residential facility for awhile but now lives with Applicant.  In 2005, 
Applicant’s hours were reduced to 24 hours a week. Part of the reason for the reduction 
in his hours was Applicant needed to care for his son. (Tr at 19-22; 29.)   
 
On October 17, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator pursuant to 
his background investigation. He told the investigator that he had plans to pay off all of 
his debts by June 2008. (Gov 3.)  
 
At hearing, Applicant stated that he intends to resolve his delinquent accounts. 
He notified his creditors when he was unemployed. He has been continuously employed 
since October 2007. He has not made any payments towards his delinquent accounts. . 
He has not attended financial counseling. He received some settlement offers from his 
creditors but has not made any repayment agreements yet. (Tr at 23-25.)  He thinks the 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, a $53 cable bill, was paid. He has a current account with the 
same company. The record was held open to allow him to submit documentation 
verifying that this debt was paid in full. (Tr at 28.) No additional documents were 
submitted. He has not paid any of the other debts. (Tr at 29.)  
 
Applicant’s car was repossessed last year because he was not able to maintain 
the payments on the car loan. His wife supports herself. She takes no responsibility for 
any of the debts. (Tr at 31-32.)  
 
Applicant’s monthly take home pay is approximately $2,732. His mortgage is 
$1,087. Other expenses include utilities $120, car insurance $40, cable television $60; 
phone $100; groceries $400, son’s medicine $60. His total monthly expenses are 
 
4 
 
 
$1,867. Provided the figures Applicant gave during the hearing are accurate, after 
expenses, he has approximately $865 left over each month. He testified that he had 
approximately $500 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 26, 33-36.) When he 
was interviewed in October 2007 pursuant to his background investigation, the numbers 
provided for his income and expenses indicated that he has approximately $550 left 
over each month after expenses. (Gov 3 at 7-8.) 
 
Applicant has no open credit card accounts. He is current on federal and state 
taxes. He never considered filing for bankruptcy. He thinks he will be able to pay his 
debts in the future as long as he remains employed. (Tr at 36-37.)     
 
Applicant states that he had no intent to deceive the government when he 
completed his security clearance application (e-QIP). He thought questions 28(a) and 
28(b) were referring to active delinquent accounts as opposed to accounts that were 
several years old. He learned a lesson and intends to list all of his delinquent accounts 
on future security clearance applications. (Tr at 40-41.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
5 
 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant has encountered financial 
difficulty since 2004. The SOR alleged 25 delinquent accounts, an approximate total 
balance of $23,955. 
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
 
6 
 
 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has a long history of financial problems. One of his accounts was placed in 
collection status as recently as May 2007. He has not begun to resolve his delinquent 
accounts. His financial problems are ongoing. 
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant’s several 
periods of unemployment from 2005 to 2007. He and his wife are in the process of filing 
for divorce. His son’s medical issues caused a further financial strain on his finances. 
However, he has been continuously employed since October 2007. He has not taken 
steps to resolve his delinquent accounts even though he has approximately $500 left 
each month after expenses that he could apply towards his delinquent accounts. While 
Applicant has had some challenging times over the past four years, I cannot conclude 
that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances because he has not taken steps  
to resolve his delinquent accounts. He was on notice that his delinquent accounts would 
be an issue by at least October 2007 when he was interviewed during his background 
investigation. He told the investigator that he had a plan to resolve all of the delinquent 
accounts by June 2008. As of December 2008, Applicant presented no plan for paying 
his delinquent accounts during the hearing. For this reason, this mitigating condition is 
given less weight.   
 
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. It would be 
helpful for him to do so in order to develop a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts.  
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant intends to resolve 
his delinquent accounts, he has taken no action to resolve any of the accounts. Though 
he claims that he resolved the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, he provided no proof that the 
debt was resolved. Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent 
accounts.   
 
Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  Guideline F 
is found against Applicant.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG &15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 Personal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his  
financial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his security 
clearance application, dated June 1, 2007.  
 
  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) ¶ 16(a) (deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in 
Applicant’s case. For PC DC ¶ 16(a) to apply, Applicant’s omission of his judgments and 
delinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant 
did not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance application. He misunderstood 
the question. He believed that he was required to list his recent financial delinquencies 
as opposed to older debts. He has learned a lesson and intends to disclose his 
delinquent accounts on future security clearance applications. I find his explanation 
credible.  
 
 The personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  
    
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. 
 
8 
 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has had 
circumstances that were beyond his control which contributed to his financial problems, 
he has been continuously employed for over 14 months and has no plan in place to 
resolve his delinquent accounts even though he has $500 in discretionary funds left 
over each month after expenses. It is too soon to conclude that his financial issues have 
been resolved due to the significant amount of his unresolved delinquent debt and the 
lack of action taken towards resolving the accounts on his part. He did not mitigate the 
concerns raised under financial considerations. Personal conduct concerns are 
mitigated because Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance application.

clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
