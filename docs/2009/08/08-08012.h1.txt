HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 24 debts totaling about $706,000. 
He received releases from liability for most of his delinquent mortgage debts. He paid 
six non-mortgage debts. One non-mortgage debt is in a payment plan. However, six 
large delinquent mortgage debts totaling about $262,592 are unresolved. Applicant 
failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 22, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 8), pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On April 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On June 3, 2009, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On June 3, 2009, the case was 
assigned to me. On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). Applicant 
waived the 15-day notice requirement in the Directive (Transcript (Tr.) 18), and 
requested that his hearing occur on June 11, 2009 (Tr. 18-19). Department Counsel 
offered six exhibits (Tr. 24; GE 1-6), and Applicant offered 24 exhibits (Tr. 26-36; AE 
A1-A14; AE B-L). Applicant did not object to my consideration of GE 1-6, and I admitted 
GE 1-6 into evidence (Tr. 24). Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of 
AE A1-A14 and AE B-L, and I admitted AE A1-A14 and AE B-L (Tr. 26-36). Additionally, 
I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On June 13, 
2009, I received AE M-AM. On June 19, 2009, I received the transcript. On July 16, 
2009, I received AE AN-AQ. I admitted AE M-AQ after consideration of Department 
Counsel’s clarifying comments, which went to the weight of the evidence, rather than to 
their admissibility.  
 
On July 22, 2009, I emailed a request for clarification through Department 
Counsel to Applicant with three attachments (AE AR). I sought an explanation for 
Applicant’s comment, “see attached paperwork,” after subparagraphs on page 2 of 
Applicant’s letter (AE M), because there was no documentation supporting his 
statements about the amounts received on resale of his mortgaged properties. I also 
attached an electronic check of the county records to assist Applicant and possibly 
Department Counsel in locating potentially relevant property records. I offered both 
parties an opportunity to submit additional evidence concerning whether Applicant owed 
or had the potential to owe additional funds on his foreclosed properties, and asked 
Applicant to provide information on the amounts he received, and when his mortgages 
were financed or refinanced (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, Applicant responded to my 
email (AE AS). On August 13, 2009, Department Counsel submitted his rebuttal (AE 
AU). On August 20, 2009, I closed the record (AE AV).     
   
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 38). He is a 
computer analyst (Tr. 40). His current employer has employed him from December 
2005 until April 30, 2009 (Tr. 41). He received his bachelors degree in June 2008 (Tr. 6, 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

39). He is taking courses towards his masters degree (Tr. 6). He majored in information 
technology (Tr. 6). He served on active duty for 20 years in the Air Force and retired as 
an E-6 in January 2005 (Tr. 7, 44). His specialty on active duty was in data 
administration (Tr. 8, 43). He received a Top Secret clearance in 1986 and currently 
holds a Top Secret clearance (Tr. 7, 42). He has been on a leave of absence from his 
employment since April 30, 2009 without pay because of the security issue (Tr. 40, 41, 
116).  
 
Applicant married in 1987 and divorced in 1997 (Tr. 46). His first wife receives 
25% of his retirement check, or about $150 a month (Tr. 47-48). His first wife 
automatically receives her share of his retirement directly from the Defense Finance and 
Accounting Service (Tr. 48). He married in 2000 and divorced in March 2005 (Tr. 44). 
His second wife is in a branch of the U.S. armed services, and she is currently on active 
duty (Tr. 55). His children from his second marriage are eight and six years of age (Tr. 
45). His children live with his second wife who is employed in a European country (Tr. 
45). He does not pay his second wife alimony; however, he does pay her $600 monthly 
in child support (Tr. 46). His child support payments are made through automatic 
deductions and are current (Tr. 46). His annual salary is $73,122 (Tr. 42). 
 
Applicant started a real estate investment company in 1989 (Tr. 49). He 
purchased properties that were foreclosed or at tax sales in a particular Midwest city 
(Tr. 49-40). He chose a particular city because that is where his mother lived (Tr. 50). 
He was not a real estate agent or broker (Tr. 52). Around 2000 to 2001, he owned as 
many as 15 properties (Tr. 53).  
 
Around 2000, Applicant had a series of problems with his properties. In 2000, a 
repair man left the water running in a tub, which caused extensive water damage (Tr. 
54). He had paid the man $10,000 to work on several properties, and he eventually 
sued the repairman for $30,000 because of the repairman’s damage to his property (Tr. 
54, 59). His mother was managing his properties, and she passed away in 2000 (Tr. 
54). He also had to evict some tenants (Tr. 54).    
 
In 2003, Applicant’s wife was having an extramarital affair (Tr. 55). Applicant 
found out about it and hit her (Tr. 55, 56). He was charged in state court with a 
misdemeanor-level assault (Tr. 57).2 The court ordered one-year of probation and 16 
weeks of domestic violence awareness classes (Tr. 112). He had to move out of their 
house (Tr. 55). Expenses increased because of the necessity to maintain two 
households (Tr. 55). A furnace went out, resulting in additional repair expenses (Tr. 56).  
 
Applicant paid the mortgages on some of the properties and used the income 
from others to pay his living expenses (Tr. 62). The next month, he would pay other 
mortgages (Tr. 62). He decided to sell some properties; however, he was unable to find 
 
2 Applicant’s SF-86 in Section 23f asked Applicant to disclose any such charges in the last seven 
years (GE 1). He denied that he had been charged with any such charges (GE 1). However, there are no 
SOR allegations against Applicant under Guidelines E or J. Accordingly, I draw no adverse inference from 
this incident itself, or from his failure to disclose this incident on his SF-86.

buyers, who would pay the prices he wanted (Tr. 63). When the divorce started, his wife 
wanted her share of the properties (Tr. 64). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s employer pays $5,000 per year towards his education expenses, and 
he receives $300 a quarter from the GI Bill (Tr. 39). His annual income before he 
became unemployed in April 2009 was $73,100 (Tr. 91). His monthly net income was 
about $3,000 (Tr. 91). His current monthly expenses are as follows: rent ($600) and 
food ($150). His car is paid off (Tr. 92). He does not have any credit cards (Tr. 92). He 
reduced his expenses substantially when he moved to a place with lower rent (rent was 
reduced from $1,500 a month to $600 a month) (Tr. 93). He has about $1,200 in his 
checking account and $200 in his savings account (Tr. 93). He has about $25,000 in his 
401K account (Tr. 94). He is current on his taxes, and is not delinquent on any non-
SOR debts (Tr. 95).  
 
Applicant owns one property and it does not have a mortgage (Tr. 96). The 
property is not occupied (Tr. 97).     
 
Non-mortgage SOR debts 
 
Applicant has seven unsecured (non-mortgage) SOR debts, totaling about 
$28,500.  Six are paid and the seventh debt cannot be resolved at this time because 
Applicant has insufficient income. Further details are provided in the next seven 
paragraphs.  
   
SOR ¶ 1.b ($4,726)—Paid. This debt to a credit card company was settled for 
$2,600 and paid on April 20, 2009 (Tr. 70; GE 9 at 8-9; AE A2). 
  
SOR ¶ 1.c ($8,145)—Payment Plan. Applicant’s debt to a credit card company 
was transferred to the creditor’s collection branch (Tr. 71). Applicant paid $2,209 in 
March 2009 (Tr. 71-73; AE A3; AE A4). He subsequently agreed to settle the debt for 
$5,000 (Tr. 73-75). However, he was unable to pay $5,000 because the creditor wanted 
the whole amount in a single payment (Tr. 75). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d ($3,125)—Paid. Applicant’s debt to a collection company was settled 
for $1,400 and paid in September 2008 (Tr. 75-76; GE 9 at 12-13; AE A5; AE A11; AE 
A15).   
 
SOR ¶ 1.p ($7,477)—Paid. Applicant’s debt to a collection company was settled 
for $2,700 and paid on October 6, 2008 (Tr. 85-86; GE 2 at 8; AE A11; AE 15). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.q ($1,750)—Paid. Applicant’s debt to a store was settled for $1,703 and 
paid on September 12, 2008 (Tr. 87; AE A12). 
  
SOR ¶ 1.u ($991)—Paid. Applicant’s SOR indicated this was a medical debt. 
Actually, it was owed to a utility company (Tr. 88; GE 2 at 16). A letter from the creditor 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
dated September 16, 2008, indicates Applicant paid this debt on September 12, 2008 
(GE 9 at 36-37; AE A13). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.x ($2,357)—Paid. Applicant’s debt to a credit card company was settled 
and paid on October 6, 2008 (Tr. 90; AE A15).  
 
Mortgage-related SOR debts 
 
The SOR alleged Applicant owed 17 foreclosure-related debts to mortgage 
companies, totaling $677,691 as follows: (1) ¶ 1.a ($48,872); (2) ¶ 1.e ($30,430); (3) ¶ 
1.f ($35,069); (4) ¶ 1.g ($35,052); (5) ¶ 1.h ($61,584); (6) ¶ 1.i ($34,728); (7) ¶ 1.j 
($20,533); (8) ¶ 1.k ($40,417); (9) ¶ 1.l ($71,724); (10) ¶ 1.m ($34,695); (11) ¶ 1.n 
($49,112); (12) ¶ 1.o ($25,200); (13) ¶ 1.r ($27,450); (14) ¶ 1.s ($35,550); (15) ¶ 1.t 
($26,680); (16) ¶ 1.v ($52,000); and (17) ¶ 1.w ($47,595).  
 
Applicant said he called his mortgage lenders and told them he could not make 
his payments (Tr. 63). They suggested he attempt a “short sale to get rid of these 
properties” (Tr. 63). He advertised in the newspaper; however, the buyers “were really 
trying to take them for, you know, pennies. And—and I put too much time and too much 
money in them to let them go for, you know, pennies on the dollar” (Tr. 64).  Eventually, 
he called the lenders and suggested they take the properties through foreclosure (Tr. 
64). 
 
When he learned he needed additional information about the status of his 
mortgage or foreclosure accounts, he sent letters to the addresses in his credit reports 
asking for the status of his mortgage debts. He provided copies of letters sent in 
September and October 2008 (GE 9 at 14-20, 25-30, 35). He also provided the letters 
he sent in April 20, 2009, April 27, 2009, and June 13, 2009 to his mortgage creditors 
(AE: A1, A7, A8, A9, A10, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, V). Several creditors wrote Applicant 
asking for additional information, such as copies of his credit report, social security 
number, or his loan number to facilitate locating his account (GE 9 at 31; AE A14; AE 
AO). Another creditor wrote Applicant that the foreclosure would not be removed from 
his credit report (GE 9 at 21-24). Applicant is waiting for the creditors to contact him and 
at that point he will attempt to negotiate a settlement of his debts (AE AT). He did not 
provide information about what he paid to purchase the properties, except he indicated 
he purchased one of them in 2000 for $7,000 (AE AT).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($49,872)—Not resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report 
indicated a closed account, last activity on account in October 2001, high credit at the 
SOR amount with the description, “ACCOUNT PAID SATISFACTORILY” and a zero 
balance (GE 2 at 19). However, the same credit report has a judgment filed in 
September 2004 from the same creditor for $49,872 (GE 2 at 3). Applicant’s March 23, 
2009, credit report shows a “second mortgage” description, high credit ($47,595) with 
nothing in the past due column (GE 6 at 4). Applicant provided a September 10, 2008, 
Equifax credit report showing a judgment on September 1, 2004, in the amount of 
$49,872 (AE L at 7). He also provided a September 10, 2008,  Experian credit report, 
showing a secured loan to this creditor, opened (April 1, 2001) with a “Paid 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
satisfactorily” description (AE L at 50). Applicant sent letters to the creditor asking for 
information about the status of his debt (AE A1; AE R; Tr. 66-67). He provided a 
reference number on the credit report and not the account number or case number 
(compare GE 2 at 3, AE L at 7 and AE L at 50). He did not send the letters to the 
address listed in his September 10, 2008, credit report (AE L at 50). He did not receive 
a reply. Applicant opined that the property was sold for the amount he owed the lender 
(Tr. 70).  He did not provide documentation showing the amount paid at the foreclosure 
sale, or the amount the lender received. After the hearing, I explained in an email to 
Applicant why I believed this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide 
additional information about the status of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, 
Applicant replied to my email; however, his response did not include any significant new 
information or describe any additional actions to obtain additional information about this 
debt’s status (AE AT).    
   
 SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($30,430), 1.f ($35,069) and 1.g ($35,052)-Resolved. Applicant 
owed these three mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 76-77). The creditor 
explained that four of Applicant’s properties went to foreclosure sales and were sold in 
2005 (AE AG) and stated, “This resulted in a zero balance owed on [these accounts] 
and ended the business relationship between [Applicant and the creditor].” (AE AG).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($61,584)—Resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report showed 
a last activity on account in August 2005, indicating a balance of $61,584, a past due 
amount of $8,139 and “FORECLOSURE REDEEMED . . . GRANTOR RECLAIMED 
COLLATERAL TO SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE” (GE 2 at 6). Applicant wrote 
letters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, 
2009 (Tr. 77-78; AE A7; AE Q). The creditor did not respond to Applicant’s request for 
information (Tr. 78). 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($34,728) and 1.j ($20,533)—Not resolved. Applicant owed these 
two mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 79-80). His July 4, 2007, credit report 
showed foreclosure filings on the two accounts in the SOR amounts, occurring in 
August and September 2004 with an “UNKNOWN” disposition (GE 2 at 50). He wrote 
letters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, 
2009 (Tr. 79-81; AE A8; AE W). The creditor did not respond to Applicant’s request for 
information (Tr. 78). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR ¶ 1.i 
property was sold without listing the sales price and the second property was sold for 
$73,900 (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation to corroborate his 
contention. After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I believed this 
debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional information about the 
status of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, Applicant replied to my email; however, 
his response did not include any significant new information or describe any additional 
actions to obtain additional information about this debt’s status (AE AT).    
 
SOR ¶ 1.k ($40,417)—Not resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report 
showed the most recent information on his account as being filed in November 2004 
with the account being in foreclosure status (GE 2 at 3). In November 2004, he owed 
$40,417 (GE 2 at 3). Applicant wrote letters to the lender asking for additional 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, 2009 (Tr. 82-83; AE U). He did not receive a 
reply from the creditor. On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR ¶ 1.k 
property was sold for $62,000 (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation 
to corroborate his contention. After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why 
I believed this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional 
information about the status and planned resolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 
2009, Applicant replied to my email; however, his response did not include any 
significant new information or describe any additional actions to obtain additional 
information about this debt’s status (AE AT). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l ($71,724)—Not resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report 
showed the most recent information on his account as being filed in March 2005 with 
the account being in foreclosure status (GE 2 at 3, 16). In November 2004, he owed 
$71,724 (GE 2 at 3, 16). It also showed a zero balance and account transferred, paid or 
sold (Tr. 82; GE 2 at 16). His September 10, 2008, credit report also showed a 
foreclosure on March 28, 2005, filed in the county court (AE L at 6). Applicant wrote 
letters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, 
2009 (Tr. 82-83; AE A9; AE V). The post office returned the letter he sent to the creditor 
with a notation from the post office indicating he used an incorrect address (Tr. 83; AE 
A9). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR ¶ 1.l property was sold for 
an unknown price (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation to 
corroborate his contention.  After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I 
believed this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional information 
about the status and planned resolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, 
Applicant replied to my email, indicating he had not taken any additional action to 
determine the status of this debt (AE AT). He said that the property was sold on March 
15, 2002, and cited to a tax record (AE AR at attachment L). See AE AT. The tax record 
indicated the owner on December 12, 2008, is the same owner that acquired the 
property on March 15, 2002 (AE AR at attachment L). Applicant did not provide 
documentation showing the property described in AE AR at attachment L was the same 
property encumbered by the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l. Applicant stated he still owned the 
property encumbered by the SOR ¶ 1.l debt in the 2004 to 2005 timeframe (AE AR). As 
such, there are too many unanswered questions to determine that this debt is resolved.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m ($34,695), 1.n ($49,112) and 1.o ($25,200)—Resolved. Applicant 
owed these three mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 83). Applicant’s July 4, 2007, 
credit report showed a last activity on account in March 2005, indicating the SOR 
amounts in the HIGH CREDIT column, a zero amount in the BALANCE column, and 
“FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED . . . CREDIT GRANTOR RECLAIMED 
COLLATERAL TO SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE” (GE 2 at 6-7). In September 
2008, Applicant wrote the creditor requesting information on the mortgage and on 
September 30, 2008, Applicant received a letter from the creditor (Tr. 84; GE 9 at 31). 
The letter is unclear about the status of Applicant’s accounts (GE 9 at 31). Applicant did 
not believe he owed anything to the creditor (Tr. 85). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a 
letter stating the SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.n and 1.o properties were sold for: price unknown 
(1.m); $51,400 (1.n); and $32,760 (1.o). However, he did not provide any 
documentation to corroborate his contention.  I conclude his March 2005 credit report,

indicating the creditor reclaimed the property to settle these debts, relieves Applicant of 
liability for these debts. I find “For Applicant” in the Formal Findings section of this 
decision.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.r ($27,450), 1.s ($35,550) and 1.t ($26,680)—Resolved. Applicant 
owed these three mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 87). Applicant’s July 4, 2007, 
credit report showed a last activity on account in October 2004, indicating the SOR 
amounts in the HIGH CREDIT column (except for SOR ¶ 1.t the credit report indicates 
$22,680 instead of $26,680), a zero amount in the BALANCE column, and 
“FORECLOSURE REDEEMED . . . CREDIT GRANTOR RECLAIMED COLLATERAL 
TO SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE” (GE 2 at 11-12). Applicant wrote the creditor 
several times requesting information on the status of these debts without receiving any 
information (Tr. 87). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR ¶¶ 1.r, 1.s 
and 1.t properties were sold for prices unknown; however, he did not provide 
documentation to corroborate his contention. I conclude his July 2007 credit report, 
indicating the creditor reclaimed the property to settle these debts, relieves Applicant of 
liability for these debts. I find “For Applicant” in the Formal Findings section of this 
decision. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.v ($52,000)—Resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report showed 
a last activity on account in May 2005, indicating the SOR amount in the HIGH CREDIT 
column, a zero amount in the BALANCE column, and “FORECLOSURE 
PROCEEDINGS INITIATED . . . CREDIT GRANTOR RECLAIMED COLLATERAL TO 
SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE” (GE 2 at 19). Applicant did not contact the creditor 
until June 13, 2009, when he sought information on the status of this debt (Tr. 89; AE 
S). He did not provide additional information about this account. I conclude his July 
2007 credit report, indicating the creditor reclaimed the property to settle this debt, 
relieves Applicant of liability for this debt. I find “For Applicant” in the Formal Findings 
section of this decision. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.w ($47,595)—Not Resolved. Applicant’s July 4, 2007, credit report 
showed a last activity on account in May 2004, indicating the SOR amount in the HIGH 
CREDIT column, and a zero amount in the BALANCE column. This credit report 
indicated the account pertained to a real estate mortgage that was now closed because 
the account was transferred (GE 2 at 19). Applicant contacted the creditor on June 13, 
2009, to request information on the status of this debt (Tr. 90; AE T). On July 18, 1009, 
the creditor responded with a request for a valid mortgage number (AE AO). After the 
hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I believed this debt was unresolved 
and asked Applicant to provide additional information about the status and planned 
resolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, Applicant replied to my email; 
however, his response did not include any significant new information or describe 
additional actions to obtain additional information about this debt’s status (AE AT). 
Applicant states he still owned the property encumbered by the SOR ¶ 1.w debt in the 
2004 to 2005 timeframe (AE AR). As such, there are too many unanswered questions to 
determine that this debt is resolved.

Applicant promised to pay his creditors if he owed them anything (Tr. 79). He 
does not intend to invest in real estate in the future (Tr. 97). He said he did not file for 
bankruptcy because he believed he was responsible for repaying his creditors (Tr. 97). 
His second divorce and the real estate downturn caused his financial problems (Tr. 98). 
I held the record open after the hearing because Applicant promised to check real 
estate records to determine whether he owed any additional money to his creditors (Tr. 
99-110). I also suggested he obtain some documentation from character references or 
his employers (Tr. 99). He completed an electronic check of the property records (AE X; 
AE Y; AE Z). After August 1, 2009, he did not provide any additional property records or 
character references. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are 
of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his 
SOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, and the documentation he submitted. 
He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability 
of mitigating conditions is required. 
  
 
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
   Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-20(e) are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his 
delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” 
However, the problem of six large delinquent mortgage debts totaling about $262,592 is 
unresolved. Applicant admitted he borrowed the money on those six mortgages; 
however, he failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish the status or 
resolution of these six accounts. Applicant has about $262,592 in unresolved, 
delinquent debt, and this substantial unresolved debt continues to “cast doubt on [his] 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted from the real estate downturn. Damage to his property from a 
handyman, the death of his mother (who was acting as his agent on his real estate 
investments), problems with his tenants, maintenance issues, and his second divorce 
contributed to his financial woes. In April 2009, he became unemployed. Despite these 
issues, he does not receive full mitigating credit because he did not establish that he 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.3   
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling as part of his 
self-education in real estate and financial matters. It is clear from his statements that he 
is intelligent and has an above average understanding of budgeting and financial 
issues. Additional financial counseling is unnecessary because of Applicant’s 
background and experience. However, there are not “clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control” because six debts totaling about $262,592 remain 
unresolved. He has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d), 
because he showed some good faith4 in the payment of his six non-mortgage related 
SOR debts and by contacting some mortgage-related SOR creditors and obtaining 
releases of his liability. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity 
of any debts, and AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts have been insufficient 
in regard to six delinquent mortgage debts, totaling about $262,592. I gave Applicant 
additional time after his hearing to obtain more information about these six mortgage 
debts. Moreover, I asked him to provide information about the price to purchase these 
properties because that information would provide an indication about whether he was 
acting responsibly when he refinanced or obtained second mortgages and whether he 
borrowed excessively. His response on August 3, 2009, did not provide additional, 
meaningful assistance in resolving the status of his six delinquent mortgage debts, 
totaling about $262,592. He did not provide sufficient information about what he paid for 
the properties and the amounts financed on his properties. He indicated he used some 
of the funds from his real estate investments for living expenses; however, he did not 
provide sufficient information about his finances to establish his financial responsibility.  
 
 
 
 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
   
Applicant provided some important mitigating evidence under the whole person 
concept. There is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding 
citizen. His current financial problems were partially caused by some factors somewhat 
beyond his control: (1) the real estate downturn; (2) damage to his property from a 
handyman; (3) the death of his mother (who was acting as his agent on his real estate 
investments); (4) problems with tenants; (5) maintenance issues on his properties; (6) 
his divorce; and (7) his unemployment beginning in April 2009. He paid or adequately 
resolved 18 of 24 SOR debts.    
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high 
school. He has a bachelors degree and earned some credits towards his masters 
degree.  He honorably retired in the grade of E-6 after 20 years of service. His 
employment history and contributions to a defense contractor speak well for his 
character. He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his 
financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and 
trustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and 
on active duty. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial 
responsibility.  
 
The evidence under the whole person concept against mitigating Applicant’s 
financial conduct is more substantial. Applicant’s six mortgage debts have been 
delinquent for a substantial period of time. He did not meet his evidentiary burden when 
he failed to establish the status of six of his delinquent mortgage debts. He currently has 
a total of six delinquent mortgage debts, totaling about $262,592. He has not paid 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
anything to these six creditors in the past several years. He noted that he had a $25,000 
retirement account, has used his real estate investments to fund his living expenses, 
and had one real estate property that was mortgage free. It is possible that the creditors 
accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure on several of the six unresolved mortgages and 
his liability was released. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted with sufficient 
effort and self-discipline to resolve his six delinquent mortgage debts and to better 
document his remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much 
financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises 
unmitigated security concerns.   
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b to 1.h:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i to 1.l:  Against Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.m to 1.v: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.w and 1.x:  Against Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
