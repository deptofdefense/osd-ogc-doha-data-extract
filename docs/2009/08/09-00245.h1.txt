HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 24 debts totaling about $35,946. He 
did not make sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant failed to 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 17, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 8), pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On June 25, 2009, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On July 1, 2009, the case was assigned 
to me. On July 2, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). On July 21, 2009, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 16), and Applicant offered one exhibit at the hearing (Tr. 30-31; AE A).  
Applicant did not object to my consideration of GE 1-6, and Department Counsel did not 
object to my consideration of AE A (Tr. 16, 31). I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A into 
evidence (Tr. 16, 31). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response 
to the SOR (GE 7-9). On July 24, 2009, I received the transcript of the hearing. On 
August 3, 2009, I received AE B and C. Department Counsel did not object to my 
consideration of AE B and C, and I admitted them into evidence.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied knowledge of most of the SOR debts. 
He asserted several were satisfied, or he was working out a payment plan with the 
particular creditor concerned (GE 9). He thought the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o were 
satisfied (GE 9). For the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.s to 1.v, he said, “payment installments 
have been made and are in progress” (GE 9). His admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact. 
  
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5). He has 
worked for his current employer since April 2003 as a security guard or supervisor of 
security guards (Tr. 42). He graduated from high school in 1989, and attended a 
university from 1989 to 1993 (Tr. 5). He did not receive a degree from the university (Tr. 
5). He does not currently hold a security clearance and has not held a security 
clearance in the past (Tr. 6-7). 
 
Applicant married in 1996 and divorced in 2000 (GE 1). His twin children were 
born in 1996 (GE 1). He never served in the military (GE 1). He remarried in December 
2008 (Tr. 38). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant has not been unemployed in more than ten years (Tr. 40). The last time 
Applicant was unemployed was in 1994, and the duration of his unemployment was 
about two months (Tr. 40). He attributed his debts to insufficient income (Tr. 41). He

was reassigned at work and his hourly wage was decreased (Tr. 42). He is current on 
his state and federal income taxes (Tr. 41).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($1,343). Applicant had a telecommunications account related to the 
collection agent in SOR ¶ 1.a (Tr. 18). He thought his debt was resolved when he paid 
the creditor $500. He said his account was “messed up”; however, he intended to pay 
this debt (Tr. 18-19). After his hearing, he called the creditor and is now waiting for a 
response from the creditor (AE C).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($104). Applicant had a medical account, which he thought was 
related to his two children (Tr. 19).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($100). Applicant had a medical account, which he said he planned to 
pay (Tr. 28).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d ($2,596). Applicant did not recognize this account (Tr. 28). Two 
weeks before his hearing he contacted the credit reporting company to find out about 
the account. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e ($741). Applicant had a cable account with this creditor (Tr. 29). He 
turned in his equipment and closed his account (Tr. 29). He did not understand why he 
owed this debt (Tr. 29). After his hearing, he contacted the creditor and asked for 
information about the debt (AE C). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,457). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f pertains to a collection agency (Tr. 
29). He did not recognize the account (Tr. 29). He intends to investigate and resolve the 
debt (Tr. 29-30). After his hearing, he telephoned the creditor and asked for information 
about the debt (AE C). The creditor told Applicant to send a letter and they would try to 
resolve the matter (AE C). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($8,673). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g pertains to a vehicle loan account 
(Tr. 20, 21). Applicant returned the vehicle to the creditor (Tr. 21). The creditor sent 
Applicant a settlement offer for $1,700 (Tr. 20, 21). Applicant offered to pay $100 per 
month; however, he had not heard the result from the creditor (Tr. 20). He said he left 
documentation about this account at his home and did not bring it to the hearing (Tr. 
21). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($712). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h pertains to a collection agency. On 
June 29, 2009, he received an offer to settle this debt for $499 and he provided a copy 
of the settlement proposal (Tr. 30; AE A). Applicant intends to follow-up on this 
settlement offer (Tr. 32). 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($177) and 1.j ($464). These two debts are from collection agencies 
and Applicant did not recognize the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j (Tr. 32).

SOR ¶ 1.k ($511).  This debt pertains to a telecommunications account (Tr. 32-
33). He said he made one $40 payment in June 2009 (Tr. 33). He intended to continue 
to make payments on this debt (Tr. 32-33).   
 
SOR ¶ 1.l ($509). Applicant admitted responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l and 
said he was going to make his first $40 payment the Friday after the hearing (Tr. 22). 
He thought maybe the debts in SOR ¶ 1.k and ¶ 1.l were the same debt (Tr. 33). After 
the hearing, he noted he is still waiting for the installment agreement (AE C).    
 
SOR ¶ 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.m, which pertains to a vehicle loan account (Tr. 22, 21). Applicant returned the vehicle 
to the creditor (Tr. 23). Applicant is waiting for the creditor to send him a settlement offer 
(Tr. 23).  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n ($148) and 1.o 
($718) (Tr. 22). He said he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o (Tr. 24, 25). These 
debts were possibly paid last year (Tr. 25). He was unable to locate documentation 
showing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o was paid (AE C). 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.p ($1,060), 1.q ($162), 1.r ($1,362), 1.x ($103). Applicant did not 
recognize these four debts (Tr. 33-35). 
 
Applicant said he was making payment arrangements for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.s ($392), 1.t ($222), 1.u ($936), and 1.v ($138). He was waiting to hear from the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, and 1.v (Tr. 26). After his hearing, he provided an undated 
letter to the creditor asking for information about the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, and 
1.v (AE B). Although Applicant had previously indicated he had payment arrangements 
and would resolve the debt in SOR ¶ 1.v by June 2009, the creditor advised him the 
debt for $138 was resolved and he did not owe anything (Tr. 27). He thought he had 
proof of satisfaction of the account in SOR ¶ 1.v in a closet; however, he was worried 
that he lost the proof in a move (Tr. 27).   
    
SOR ¶ 1.w ($318). This is a telecommunications debt (Tr. 34). About two years 
ago Applicant contacted the creditor and asked the creditor to add the debt to his 
current account (Tr. 34-35). His account with the creditor was current (Tr. 35). After the 
hearing, the creditor advised him that he would soon receive a bill for $318 (AE C).  
 
Appellant has not received any credit counseling (Tr. 36). He did not attempt to 
resolve most of his SOR debts prior to his hearing because of a lack of funds (Tr. 36). 
Applicant and his spouse earn about $5,300 monthly (Tr. 37-38). He listed monthly 
expenses are as follows: rent ($2,500), car payment ($630), and child support ($600) 
(Tr. 38-39). He has about $150 left at the end of the month (Tr. 39). In their marriage, 
Applicant pays the rent, his car payment, and his child support, and his wife pays for 
everything else (Tr. 38-39).  Applicant does not have any savings (Tr. 40).     
 
Applicant said he kept copies of his correspondence to the creditors, and I held 
the record open for ten days so that Applicant could provide copies for the record of 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
documentation showing his investigative efforts, payment plans, and anything else he 
believed would be helpful to his case (Tr. 23).  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that 
are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his 
SOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, and the documentation he submitted. 
He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability 
of mitigating conditions is required. 
  
   Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-20(e) are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant’s SOR lists 24 debts totaling 
about $35,946. He did not recognize several debts. He thought several other debts 
were paid or resolved. He is investigating several debts. Important documentation about 
his debts was lost during a move. He did not provide documentary evidence of any 
payments or paid SOR debts. It is particularly clear that he has not made significant 
progress on resolution of four SOR debts totaling about $22,000: ¶ 1.c ($100), ¶ 1.g 
($8,673), ¶ 1.h ($712), and ¶ 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted responsibility for these 
four SOR debts; however, he failed to provide documentation to establish the resolution 
of these accounts. Applicant has about $22,000 in unresolved, delinquent debt, and this 
substantial unresolved debt continues to “cast doubt on [his] current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because a transfer reduced his 
salary and caused a decrease in his hourly pay. Despite this issue, he does not receive 
full mitigating credit because he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.2   
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. 
Financial counseling would be very helpful to Applicant because he is evidently not 
sophisticated about budgeting and financial matters. There are not “clear indications 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” because most of the SOR debts 
totaling about $30,000 remain unresolved. He has also established some, but not full 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some, recent good faith3 in the 
resolution of his debts and by contacting some SOR creditors and seeking to begin 
payment plans. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any 
debts, and AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts to document the 
resolution of most of his SOR debt have been inadequate. Applicant was given 
additional time after his hearing to obtain more information about his efforts to resolve 
his SOR debts. His response on August 3, 2009, did not provide additional, meaningful 
assistance in resolving the status of his SOR debts. He did not provide sufficient 
information about his finances and debt resolution to establish his financial 
responsibility.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
   
Applicant provided some important mitigating evidence under the whole person 
concept. There is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding 
citizen. His current financial problems were partially caused by a factor beyond his 
control, that is, decreased income due to a transfer.     
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high 
school and earned credits towards a university degree. His employment history and 
contributions to a defense contractor speak well for his character. He understands the 
importance of a budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. 
Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his 
service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. These factors, especially his past 
government service, show substantial responsibility.  
 
The evidence under the whole person concept against mitigating Applicant’s 
financial conduct is more substantial. Applicant’s SOR lists 24 debts totaling about 
$35,946. The SOR was based on his credit reports. He did not recognize several debts. 
He thought several other debts were paid or resolved. He is investigating several debts. 
Important documentation about his debts was lost during a move. It is clear that he has 
not made sufficient progress on resolution of four SOR debts totaling about $22,000: ¶ 
1.c ($100), ¶ 1.g ($8,673), ¶ 1.h ($712), and ¶ 1.m ($13,000). Applicant admitted 
responsibility for these four SOR debts; however, he failed to provide sufficient 
documentation to establish the resolution of these accounts. He did not provide 
documentation showing payment or resolution of any SOR debts. These debts have 
been delinquent for a substantial period of time. He did not meet his evidentiary burden 
of establishing his plan to resolve or actual resolution of these four debts. He has not 
paid anything to these four creditors in the past several years. Ultimately, he did not 
establish that he acted with sufficient effort and self-discipline to resolve these four 
delinquent debts and to better document his remedial efforts. All the factors considered 
together show too much financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of 
delinquent debt raises unmitigated security concerns.   
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant

has not fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.
