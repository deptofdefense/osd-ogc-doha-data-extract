Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  
(e-QIP) on June 11, 2008. On January 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 
1, 2006.  
  
 On March 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 17, 2009. 
The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2009. Scheduling the hearing was delayed 
because Applicant was on temporary duty out of the area until May 2009. On June 22, 
2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2009. The 
case was heard on that date. The Government offered four exhibits which were 
admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 4. The Applicant testified and offered four 
 
2 
 
 
exhibits which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The 
record was held open until July 28, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional 
documents. He requested an extension until August 5, 2009. His request was granted. 
He timely submitted a 14-page document that was admitted as AE E. Department 
Counsel’s response to AE E is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was 
received on July 22, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, 
and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Amendment to SOR 
 
 The Government moved to amend the SOR to conform with the evidence 
provided by Applicant during the hearing under ¶ E3.1.17 to add the following 
paragraph: 
 
 1.ll  You are indebted to the federal government in the approximate 
amount of $17,000 for back taxes owed for tax year 2003.   
 
Applicant had no objection to the amendment. The motion to amend the SOR 
was granted. Applicant was permitted to submit additional documentation that was 
relevant to this allegation after the hearing. (Tr at 50 – 56) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.t, 
1.u, 1.x, 1.y, and 1.ff.  He admits the remaining SOR allegations.  
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old test support specialist employed by a Department of 
Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with this 
company since September 2007. From September 1989 to September 1995, he served 
on active duty in the United States Army. He was an air traffic controller. He separated 
as an E-4 with an honorable discharge. His DD FORM 214 indicates the reason for 
separation was due to a reduction in force. He held a security clearance while in the 
military. He is divorced and has three children, two sons, ages 13 and 14, and a 
daughter, age 12. (Tr at 5-7, 24-25, Gov 1; AE E at 15)  
 
On June 11, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. A 
subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has financial issues. The 
SOR alleged 37 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,328. Of the 37 debts, 
27 debts are medical debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1,d, 1.f – 1.o, 1.u, 1.ww – 1.ee, 1.gg – 1.kk) 
The medical debts total $10,516. The consumer debts total $14,812. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.e, 1.p – 1.t, 1.v, and 1.ff) Approximately $12,200 of the consumer debt relates to an 
automobile repossession. (SOR ¶ 1.b) During the hearing, Applicant revealed that he 
owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $17,000 for tax year 2003. (Tr at 50-
51)

Applicant states that his financial problems are the result of his divorce in 1999. 
His child support is $900 a month. His priority is his monthly child support payment.  He 
was not paid well enough in some of his previous jobs to pay his debts as well as child 
support. As a result, some debts have not been paid over the years. The medical debts 
are the result of Applicant having no health insurance for several years after separating 
from the military. Applicant injured his knee in August 2000, requiring numerous visits to 
doctors over the years. He describes his medical condition as inflammation of the knee 
joints. He recently received a diagnosis of gout. (Tr at 16-18, 44, 57; Answer to SOR) 
 
Applicant’s current job provides health insurance. Applicant believes his current 
job gives him an opportunity to earn a good living. He is working towards resolving his 
debts. In early 2003, he went to consumer credit counseling after his truck was 
repossessed. He did not enter into a repayment plan because he was unable to make 
payments. He consulted consumer credit counseling again in September 2008, but did 
not enter into a repayment plan at that time either. In early July 2009, he consulted a 
bankruptcy attorney about filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. He has not formally 
filed bankruptcy out of concern it would be detrimental to his case. He paid some of the 
smaller debts. His plan is to take care of the debts under $400 and then file for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13. (Tr at 18-19, 43-48; AE E at 2)

Applicant provided receipts indicating he paid several bills.  It is unclear whether 
these receipts paid debts alleged in the SOR or other bills. (See AE A at 3-4; AE B at 1, 
3) 
 
During the hearing, Applicant was asked whether he owed any back taxes to the 
state or federal government. He admitted that he owes the Internal Revenue Service 
approximately $17,000 for tax year 2003. He was an independent owner/operator 
during that year. He did not file federal taxes for tax year 2003. The Internal Revenue 
Service first contacted Applicant in January 2009 about this debt. Applicant recently 
retained a law firm to represent him in this matter. He intends to submit an offer in 
compromise. No formal offer in compromise had been submitted prior to the hearing. (Tr 
at 50 – 56; AE D) The status of the tax debt at the close of the record is unresolved.  
 
Applicant’s pay varies based on the amount of overtime he earns each pay 
period.  His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 29, 2009, was 
$1,193.81. His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 15, 2009, was 
$1,269.15. His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 1, 2009, was 
$1,363.42. (AE C)  His child support is automatically deducted from his pay check. He is 
paid every two weeks.  After expenses, Applicant has approximately $200 left over each 
month. He was going to submit a budget after the hearing. A budget was not submitted 
in his post-hearing submissions. (Tr at 49, 58) 
 
Applicant does not believe he is a security risk. He has been promoted twice over 
the past six months. (Tr at 19-20)  He received top ratings in a performance appraisal 
covering the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008. (AE E at 6-12) He 
received a certificate of appreciation on March 27, 2008. (AE E at 3) 
 
Applicant’s girlfriend testified on his behalf.  She and Applicant have dated for 
three years. Applicant is a wonderful father and tries very hard to provide for his 
children. He is working hard to get his debt under control. She works for the same 
directorate as Applicant but not directly with him. She states that Applicant is well 
respected by the command. (Tr at 60-62)  
 
The commander of the directorate where Applicant works wrote a letter on 
Applicant’s behalf. He indicates Applicant has worked in his command for over a year. 
He has only positive things to say about Applicant’s work ethic, trustworthiness, and 
character. (AE E at 4) Applicant’s supervisor, a senior program officer, states Applicant 
is an indispensable asset. He is always willing to take on additional tasks or 
assignments. Applicant’s attention to detail, exemplary dedication to duty and mission 
accomplishment, and untiring work ethic have paid huge dividends to both the 
organization and the customers. (AE E At 5)     
 
During his active duty Army service, Applicant was awarded the Army 
Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal (3rd Award), the Army Service Ribbon, the 
Overseas Service Ribbon, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, the Expert Marksmanship 
 
7 
 
 
Qualification Badge With Grenade Bar, and the Sharpshooter Marksmanship 
Qualification Badge M-16. (AE E at 15)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant encountered financial 
difficulties since 1999 as a result of his divorce and separation from active duty in the 
United States Army.  The SOR alleged 37 delinquent accounts with an approximate 
total balance of $25,328. Applicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service 
approximately $17,000 for unpaid taxes for tax year 2003.  
 
The government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Most 
of Applicant’s delinquent accounts remain unresolved. While Applicant resolved several 
of his delinquent accounts and is in the early stages of anticipating bankruptcy, it will 
take some time to resolve his financial problems. Applicant has a significant number of 
delinquent accounts. Of the 37 debts alleged in the SOR, 20 are under $200 which 
indicates a lack of attention to finances rather than an inability to pay. Applicant’s 
financial issues raise questions about his reliability and good judgment.    
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
 
9 
 
 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant’s divorce. 
However, Applicant has been divorced for over 10 years. While he has a large child 
support payment, it does not explain all of his delinquent accounts. After separating 
from active duty, Applicant found employment but the employers did not provide health 
insurance. It is noted that 27 of the 37 debts alleged in the SOR are medical accounts. 
The total amount of the medical debt is $10,516. The total amount of the consumer debt 
is $14,812. Of that amount $12,220 relates to a truck repossession in 2003. Applicant 
does not appear to be spending extravagantly. However, he has numerous delinquent 
accounts with small balances and a substantial tax debt. He did not take action towards 
resolving his remaining delinquent accounts and his tax debt until recently. I cannot 
conclude that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. For this reason, FC 
MC ¶ 20(b) is given less weight.   
  
FC MC ¶20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant has consulted with consumer credit counseling on two 
occasions but never entered into a repayment plan. He recently consulted a bankruptcy 
attorney about filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 and a tax attorney about 
submitting an offer in compromise related to the tax debt. However, the documents 
provided at hearing indicate that the consultations are in the preliminary stages. 
Applicant is still in the midst of his financial problems.   
 
FC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.h, 1.t, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y.  However, the remaining debts are unresolved. 
Applicant has had no contact for several years with many of his creditors including the 
Internal Revenue Service. He just recently started to look at options for resolving his 
$17,000 tax debt as well as a potential bankruptcy filing. Overall, Applicant has not 
made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  
 
FC MC ¶20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) does not apply. While Applicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ff, he  
provided no evidence that he formally disputed the debt. He has not demonstrated that 
there is a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt.  
 
Most of the delinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is too soon to conclude 
that he has mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    
  
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
10 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s active duty 
service in the United States Army and the highly favorable recommendations of his 
current employer. I considered that his divorce in 1999 caused financial problems.  
However, the divorce occurred ten years ago and much of the debt was incurred after 
the divorce. I considered that Applicant is current on his child support obligations. I 
considered he incurred medical debt because he had no health insurance.  While 
Applicant is highly regarded by his employer, his financial situation remains in question. 
It is premature to conclude Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.  He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial 
considerations.
