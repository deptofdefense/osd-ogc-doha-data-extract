ANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: 
 
 After a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations.  His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP) on September 11, 2008. On March 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 
2 
 
 
 On April 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have his 
case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. On May 27, 2009, he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. 
I convened a hearing on July 15, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
Government called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 
through 4 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own 
behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced sixteen exhibits, which were identified 
and marked as Applicant’s Ex. A through P and admitted to the record without objection.   
 
At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of 
business July 22, 2009, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the 
record. Applicant timely filed 14 additional documents, which were marked as Ex. Q 
through Z and AA through DD. Applicant’s post-hearing submissions were admitted to 
the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July 
23, 2009. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR contains sixteen allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, 
Financial Considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.p.). In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted thirteen of the allegations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., 
1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., and 1.p.); he denied three allegations (¶¶ 1.f., 1.h., and 1.o.). 
Applicant’s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 46-65, 83-
96, 112-133.)  
 
 Applicant seeks a security clearance. He is 32 years old and, since September 
2008, he has been employed as an enterprise management engineer by a government 
contractor. He has been married to his wife for five years, and they are the parents of 
three young children. Applicant’s annual gross salary is approximately $75,000. His 
wife, who is not employed outside of the home, manages the family’s finances. (Ex. 1; 
Ex. R; Tr. 68-69, 109, 138, 146-147.) 
 
 Applicant is a high school graduate. He attended college for a time and estimates 
that he achieved sophomore or junior status. Since September of 1997, he has worked 
for a variety of employers as a computer technician and specialist. From December 
2004 until September 2008, he worked for a municipal government as a security 
engineer. His highest annual salary in that job was $70,000.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 70-75, 137-
140.) 
 
 In 2005, when his annual salary was approximately $65,000, Applicant and his 
wife purchased a home, which was financed by a first mortgage of approximately 
$125,000 and a second mortgage of approximately $30,000. In 2006, Applicant’s 
mother, who lived in a neighboring state, fell ill and required two surgeries in one month. 
During this time, Applicant and his wife drove frequently to his mother’s home to be with 
her. Applicant found that he needed to use his disposable income to purchase gasoline 
 
3 
 
 
for the trips to visit his mother, and he fell behind in paying some of his financial 
obligations, including his home mortgages. He contacted the mortgagor and requested 
a reduced payment plan. The mortgagor complied, and after about nine or ten months 
on the payment plan, Applicant was able to catch up and became current on his 
mortgage payments.  In mid to late 2007, Applicant again fell behind in his mortgage 
payments, and after four months on a payment plan, he became current again on his 
mortgages. In September 2008, Applicant resigned from his job. He took a position with 
his current employer and moved his family to another city. He was unable to sell his 
house, and he did not have sufficient funds to pay his mortgages. (Tr. 48-49, 135-137.)  
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was over 180 days past due in 
the approximate amount of $10,946 on the $125,776 mortgage and over 180 days past 
due in the approximate amount of $1,860 on the $30,962 mortgage. (SOR ¶¶ 1.j. and 
1.k.)  The lender has offered to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure from Applicant and 
his wife, but the final terms of the agreement were not in place at the time of his 
hearing, and the debts were not resolved. When he completed his e-QIP in September 
2008, Applicant reported his mortgage delinquency of $125,776 and stated: “This is the 
only thing that is past due on my credit report.” (Tr. 49-50, 123.) 
 
 Applicant’s credit report of September 30, 2008 revealed 13 debts in collection 
status. Those debts were alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a. to 1.g., SOR ¶ 1.i., and SOR ¶¶ 1.l., to 
1.p. Additionally, the SOR alleged at ¶ 1.h. that Applicant was 30 days past due in 
making a payment of $137 on a debt of $2,423. (Ex. 4; SOR.) 
 
 In February 2009, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and provided a 
monthly budget and a long-range plan to satisfy his delinquent debts. He stated that he 
intended to pay the $105 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.b. in March 2009 and the 
$163 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.g. in April 2009. He further stated he intended to 
pay the $367 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d. with three monthly payments of $123 in 
May, June, and July of 2009; he intended to pay the $476 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 
1.p. in four monthly payments of $120 from August through November 2009; he 
intended to pay the $726 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.n. in seven monthly payments 
of $110 from December 2009 to June 2010; and he intended to satisfy the $1,024 
delinquency alleged  at SOR ¶ 1.m. with eight monthly payments of $128 from July 
2010 to February 2011. (Ex. 2 at 4-5.) 
 
 In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he also expressed his intention to 
satisfy the $1,595 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.i. in 12 monthly payments of $133 
between March 2011 and 2012, and he expressed his intention to satisfy the $2,035 
delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.e. in 15 monthly payments of $136 between April 2012 
and June 2013. (Ex. 2 at 5.) 
 
 In his April 23, 2009, answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he intended to pay 
the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.b. in July 2009. He stated that he intended to pay the debt 
alleged at SOR ¶ 1.g. in August 2009. He stated he was currently paying the debt 
 
4 
 
 
                                           
alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d, and he stated he had paid the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.f. (Answer 
to SOR.) 
 
 At his July 15, 2009, hearing, Applicant stated that he intended to satisfy his 
smaller debts first and pay the larger debts in the future. He stated he did not intend to 
contact his creditors until he was ready to pay them. As his Ex. A, he provided a third 
iteration of his plan to satisfy his debts. He acknowledged that none of the three plans 
indicated how he intended to satisfy the $2,240 debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.a. He also 
acknowledged that he had not contacted the creditor identified in SOR ¶ 1.a. In his third 
plan describing his intention to pay the creditors identified on the SOR, he stated that 
the $105 delinquent debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.b. would be satisfied in June 2009. He 
stated that the debt had been incurred in 2001 or 2002.  He reported that his wife was 
planning to hand a check for $105 to the creditor. As a post-hearing document, he 
provided a receipt corroborating a payment of $25 on the debt on July 21, 2009.  (Ex. A; 
Ex. U; Tr. 57, 83-84, 8-93.) 
 
 Applicant stated that, in addition to the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.a., he intended to 
pay the following delinquent debts alleged on the SOR at some future date: SOR ¶¶ 1.c. 
($649), 1.e. ($2,116), 1.i. ($1,595), 1.m. ($1,024), 1.n. ($726), and 1.p. ($476). He 
stated he planned to pay the $163 delinquency alleged at SOR ¶ 1.g. in August 2009. 
He provided documentation to corroborate that he had paid the $624 delinquent debt 
alleged at SOR ¶ 1.l., and he provided documentation to corroborate a payment of $20 
on the $367 delinquent debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d. He claimed he had paid the $235 
debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.f., but he failed to provide documentation to corroborate 
payment. Additionally, he claimed he had disputed the $137 delinquent debt alleged at 
SOR ¶ 1.h.1 and the $58 delinquent debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.o., but he failed to provide 
documentation to corroborate his disputations. (Ex. M; Ex. CC; Tr. 57-65.)         
  
    Applicant is paid once a month. His net take-home pay is $4,076.45.  His 
monthly fixed expenses are as follows: rent: $1,600; groceries: $500; clothing: $100; 
gas: $100; electricity: $130; water: $65; trash collection: $20; telephone: $156; and cell 
phones for himself and his wife: $210.  He estimates his monthly out-of-pocket medical 
expenses are about $20. He budgets $100 for miscellaneous expenses.  (Ex. R; Ex. 2; 
Tr. 52, 145-149.)  
 
 Additionally, in 2008, Applicant’s mother signed a purchase agreement on his 
behalf for a new 2008 model automobile which cost $28,000. Applicant pays $600 a 
month directly to the automobile creditor. He estimates that his additional monthly car 
expenses include $260 for gas for his automobile and his wife’s automobile, $150 for 
automobile insurance, and $10 for oil changes and maintenance. (Tr. 149-155, 157.) 
 
 
1 Applicant claimed that he had paid the creditor over $4,000 to satisfy this debt and he denied he owed 
the remaining $137. However, he failed to provide documentation to corroborate his claim. (Ex. Y; Tr. 
114-115. 
 
5 
 
 
 Applicant’s net remainder at the end of each month is approximately $55. He 
lacks sufficient resources to pay additional medical bills which arose when his third child 
was born. These debts are outstanding, and his mother subsidizes his income each 
month by paying about $100 of those medical bills. Additionally, Applicant owes a tax 
debt of $14,000, including interest and penalties, to the Internal Revenue Service, and 
he has agreed to pay $200 each month to reduce his federal tax debt. When asked 
where he obtained the money to pay the tax debt, he stated: “[W]e take it out of 
groceries, we take it out of utilities, whatever we don’t use. And we’ve never been late. 
We do - - - what is it - - - rob Peter to pay Paul.” (Ex. S; Tr. 157-161.) 
 
 Applicant presented six letters of character reference from supervisors, co-
workers, and former colleagues. The letters of character reference emphasized 
Applicant’s dependability, excellent technical skills, strong work ethic, and 
professionalism. (Ex. F; Ex. G; Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J; Ex. K.) 
 
 Applicant has not sought or received professional consumer credit counseling. 
(Tr. 172-173.)  
     
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and 
it has emphasized that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the 
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an   
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
 
6 
 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
 
7 
 
 
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Additionally, under AG ¶ 19(e), a security concern can be raised 
when there is “consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, 
and/or other financial analysis.” Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt, was 
unable or unwilling to pay his creditors, and consistently spent beyond his means. This 
evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions 
could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant’s financial delinquencies. 
Unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it “happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
(AG ¶ 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s 
control, (e.g.,loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” (AG ¶ 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might 
be applicable include evidence that “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or 
is under control” (AG ¶ 20(c) or “the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” (AG ¶ 20(d))  Finally, if “the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of options to resolve the issue,” then AG ¶ 20(e) might apply.  
 
Applicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from   
at least 2001 or 2002 to the present time. When his mother fell ill and required surgeries 
in 2006, Applicant drove great distances to visit her, and this cost him money in 
gasoline. Fortunately, Applicant’s mother recovered, and he has, for the most part, been 
steadily employed since that time. His annual income is approximately $75,000. 
 
 Applicant is financially overextended, and he has few resources available to pay 
his delinquent debts at this time. He hopes to pay most of his creditors in the future, but 
he has difficulty meeting his basic expenses each month, a situation that casts doubt on 
his ability to plan realistically for the future. He provided documentation to corroborate 
that he had paid a debt of $624, alleged at SOR ¶ 1.l. He failed to provide 
documentation to prove that he had satisfied a debt of $235, alleged at SOR ¶ 1.f. He 
also failed to provide documentation to corroborate that he had contested debts alleged 
at ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.o.    
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. He relies on his wife to manage 
his income, and he relies on his mother to provide him with extra money to meet his 
expenses. While he admitted his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he 
understood his financial problems or how to resolve them. He was financially over-
 
8 
 
 
extended and had very little money left at the end of each month. In spite of this, he 
purchased a new automobile for $28,000 in 2008, and his automobile expenses 
consume a substantial portion of his monthly disposable income. He uses money 
budgeted for food or other basic living expenses to pay his federal tax debt each month. 
He has no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt and 
prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that none of the Financial Consideration 
mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant’s case. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 32 
years. His supervisors and colleagues consider him to be diligent, hard-working, and 
professional. They appreciate his technical skills and dependability.  
 
Applicant’s financial problems began at least seven years ago. He has not 
pursued financial counseling. Despite an annual income of $75,000, he has not taken 
affirmative action to live within his means and to pay or resolve his substantial 
delinquent debts. His lack of attention to his financial delinquencies continues to raise 
security concerns. Despite a steady income for several years, he failed to budget his 
income to satisfy his many delinquent debts. Instead, he continued on a pattern of 
overextension. He has a low net remainder at the end of every month, and he appears 
unable to meet his financial obligations, raising concerns about his judgment and 
potential financial vulnerability. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present 
time as to Applicant’s judgment, eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For 
 
9 
 
 
these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from 
his financial delinquencies.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST  APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.k.:           Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l.:            For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.m. - 1.p. :         Against Applicant 
   
    
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
