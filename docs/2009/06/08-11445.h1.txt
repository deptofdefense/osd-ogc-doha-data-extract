HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 20 debts totaling $144,233. He 
paid two debts totaling about $12,500. There were several duplications and disputed 
debts, leaving 10 undisputed, delinquent debts totaling $118,847 to resolve. Applicant 
failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On April 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 7). Department Counsel 
was prepared to proceed on May 19, 2009. On May 27, 2009, the case was assigned to 
me. On June 16, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on June 
18, 2009.1 At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 17-18), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-C). There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 18), and AE A-C (Tr. 22). Additionally, I 
admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 5-7). I received the 
transcript on June 25, 2009.     
   
Findings of Fact2 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.d ($14,426), 1.e ($628), 1.h ($9,468), 1.i ($18,590), 
1.j ($25,103), 1.k ($3,922), 1.m ($29,104), 1.n ($5,907), 1.p ($570), 1.q ($10,775), 1.r 
($984) and 1.t ($12,280) (GE 7). He denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f 
($106), 1.g ($183), 1.o ($980), and 1.s ($10,095) (because they duplicate the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.t ($12,280), and 1.l ($374) (GE 7). He described how 
his debts became delinquent (GE 7). His SOR response was consistent with his hearing 
statement. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 24). He has a 
master’s degree in computer science (Tr. 6). He has worked in his current position on 
the night shift since August 2005 (Tr. 24-25, 59). His monthly net, take home pay is 
about $3,000 (Tr. 60). In February 2009, he lost his other government contractor job 
after 21 years of continuous employment with that contractor because of the delay in 
the adjudication of his clearance (Tr. 25-27).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.o ($980) and 1.s ($10,095) are duplications of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.t ($12,280). The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.t had to file four civil actions to get paid. 
On October 14, 2008, Applicant completed payment of the debt through garnishment of 
his pay (Tr. 28-30, 55-57; AE A).   
 
 
1On May 29, 2009, Department counsel discussed the hearing date, time and location with 
Applicant (Tr. 32). Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice to the date, time and location of his hearing 
and agreed to proceed with his hearing on June 18, 2009 (Tr. 30-32).

information is available in the cited exhibits.

Applicant intends to dispute SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.e 
($628), and 1.g ($183) (Tr. 63-65). The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.g were for the same 
amount. He believed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were medical debts that 
his insurance company was supposed to pay (Tr. 65). He intended to dispute two non-
SOR debts for $139, $450 and $59 because they should have been covered by medical 
insurance (Tr. 64-65). He did not dispute the other debts (Tr. 66). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f 
is paid (Tr. 77-78).   
 
In 1995, Applicant was divorced (Tr. 36). He was responsible for paying $315.17 
every two weeks for child support for one child born in 1992 (Tr. 36-37; GE 1). In 2003, 
he missed four payments; however, now he is paid up and current on his child support 
obligation (Tr. 37). He is obligated to make these payments until his child reaches the 
age of 18 in January 2010 (Tr. 38). 
 
Applicant fell behind on his debts in 2002 (Tr. 33). His girlfriend/partner 
contracted leukemia and Applicant helped her with her debts (Tr. 35, 57-58). He co-
owns a house with her and when she was ill, he contributed about $2,000 monthly to 
her (Tr. 44-45). She had some income from her former husband and from some 
investments (Tr. 58). The mortgage on the property where she lives is current (Tr. 45). 
Applicant now lives in an apartment in a different state from the state where the 
mortgaged property is located (Tr. 45). 
 
Applicant charged his bills on his credit cards, while still believing that he could 
sell some property and use his profits to pay his debts (Tr. 35). He sold two properties 
before he really wanted to do so, and used the profits to pay daily living expenses (Tr. 
35). In the fall in 2002, Applicant sought assistance from and signed a contract with a 
debt consolidation company (DCC) (Tr. 39). He worked with the DCC for about six 
weeks (Tr. 40). He terminated his agreement with DCC because their charges were too 
high (Tr. 40-41). His employer did not recommend any particular debt counseling or 
debt consolidation company (Tr. 42). In 2003, he went to another debt consolidation 
company and they recommended that he declare bankruptcy (Tr. 43-44). He did not 
want to use bankruptcy to avoid repayment of his creditors (Tr. 43). By 2004, his real 
estate investment properties were sold (Tr. 51-52). After 2004, he did not receive any 
other debt counseling or work with any debt consolidation companies (Tr. 41-42, 44).   
 
Applicant’s partner lives in the only real estate where Applicant has an ownership 
interest (Tr. 51). Applicant owns two cars (Tr. 46). The newest one is 14 years old (Tr. 
46). There are no liens on his cars (Tr. 46). He does not have a checking account (Tr. 
47). His other bank accounts have very limited funds (Tr. 47). He does not have any 
other non-bank financial-type accounts (Tr. 49). He cashed out his 401K and pension 
plan in March or April of 2009 and received about $30,000 (Tr. 49-50). He used the 
funds for living expenses for the house where his partner lived and for his living 
expenses in another state (Tr. 50-51). His total assets are about $2,000 (primarily 
clothes, laptop computer, and two old cars) (Tr. 74-75). 
 
Applicant informed the credit card account creditors that the accounts should be 
closed, and he would pay when he was able (Tr. 53-54). He plans to pay his delinquent 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
debts a little at a time (Tr. 52, 66). He has learned to keep his expenses low, and 
maintains a lower standard of living than previously when his income was higher. For 
example, he did not purchase newer cars. His frugal spending habits increased 
available funds to address his debts (Tr. 52). He recently asked the mortgage holder 
(mortgage amount: $205,000) to reduce his payments (Tr. 69; AE C). He was optimistic 
about the future, noting his plan to reduce his payments to his partner next month, and 
his payments to support his child would end early in 2010 (Tr. 67, 73). When he has 
funds accrued, he intends to contact his creditors and negotiate settlements (Tr. 68). 
Applicant’s personal financial statement showed his approximate monthly expenses 
($5,609) substantially exceeded his approximate monthly income from his current 
employment ($3,000) mostly because he has two households that he is attempting to 
support (Tr. 70-73; AE C). Before he lost his primary employment in February 2009, he 
had sufficient income to pay his expenses. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and, “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent 
debt is documented in his SF-86, his credit reports (GE 3, 4, AE B), his SOR response 
and at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The 
government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further 
inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.

   Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of the real estate downturn as well as his support for his 
girlfriend/partner, who has cancer. He receives some mitigating credit because his 
delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur;” 
however, the problem of about $118,847 in delinquent debt continues to “cast doubt on 
[his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” He established that he paid 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.t ($12,280) and 1.f ($106) and he is current on his mortgage and 
his expenses of daily living, such as his rent. He disputes five debts mostly because he 
believes they are covered by medical insurance and one is a telephone company debt: 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.e ($628), and 1.l ($374). Three debts are 
duplications of other debts: SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.o and 1.s. He has promised to pay the 
remaining debts; however, that promise is unlikely to successfully resolve his debts as 
indicated by the lack of meaningful progress he has demonstrated over the last four 
years.    
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received some financial counseling and 
worked with a debt consolidation program in 2003 for about six weeks. However, there 
are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” because 
ten debts totaling about $118,847 remain unresolved. He has also established some, 
but not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some, recent good faith3 in 
the resolution of his SOR debts by paying one large debt through garnishment of his 
pay.    
 
Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any debts. 
However, I will apply AG ¶ 20(e) because he credibly disputes five small debts totaling 
about $1,500, which is less than two percent of his total delinquent debt. His overall 
recent conduct; however, does not show that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.4  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last four years, he has not done anything 
to address ten delinquent debts, totaling $118,847, even though up until February 2009 
he had sufficient funds from his two jobs to make greater progress.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is insufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security 
violation(s). He is a law-abiding citizen. His current financial problems were caused by 
some factors partially or fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income, (2) the real 
estate downturn, and (3) his girlfriend/partner’s cancer. He paid two SOR debts. His 
pays his current living expenses. He pays his rent, mortgage and utilities. Five SOR 
debts are disputed. Three SOR debts are duplications. He has a plan to pay his other 
SOR debts. He does not have any credit cards.  
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. Up to February 2009, he 
had been employed by the same defense contractor for 21 years. This stable 
employment and contributions to a defense contractor speaks well for his character. In 
February 2009, he lost that employment because of his security clearance problem 
relating to his delinquent debts. He still holds employment on the night shift with another 
government contractor. He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to 
establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism 
and trustworthiness through his 21 years of service to the Department of Defense as a 
contractor. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial 
responsibility. However, all of these positive attributes are insufficient to mitigate 
security concerns at this time.  
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct is more substantial. 
Applicant’s debts became delinquent more than four years ago. Through those four 
years, up to February 2009, he should have made greater progress addressing his 
delinquent debts. He has admitted a total of ten delinquent debts, totaling $118,847, 
and he has not paid anything to these 10 creditors in at least four years. He showed 
some effort to increase his income by working two jobs, but he did not make enough 
effort to reduce his expenses until recently. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted 
with sufficient effort and self-discipline to resolve his delinquent debts and to better 
document his remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much

financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises 
unmitigated security concerns.   
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.
