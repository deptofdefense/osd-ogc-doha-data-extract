Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern created by his debts that have
remained delinquent for many years. He failed to take any action to resolve most of the
debts listed in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), and his testimony and the evidence he
presented gives little reason to anticipate he will resolve those debts in the foreseeable
future.
On November 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR, dated December 8, 2008, admitted all SOR allegations
and requested a hearing.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS

The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued
on April 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 27, 2009. The hearing was conducted as
scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified, called one witness, and submitted 6 documentary exhibits that were marked as
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript
was received on May 5, 2009.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In
addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 35-year-old man who has been employed as a senior communications
equipment analyst by a defense contractor since October 2002. From July 2002 through
September 2002, he worked for this same employer through placement by a staffing
agency. Applicant’s manager testified he has known Applicant since October 2004, and
has continuing and regular contact with him. In his opinion, Applicant is an outstanding and
innovative technician who is reliable and trustworthy. He is confident Applicant has the
ability to safeguard classified information.  
Applicant graduated from high school in 1992, and he attended a technical school
from November 1992 to July 1994. He did not graduate from the technical school. 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on October 29, 2007, in which he listed his employment history prior to working for
the defense contractor as follows: 09/2001 to 06/2002 - customer service through a staffing
agency; 08/2001 to 08/2001 - unemployment; 07/2001 to 07/2001 - computer technician
through a staffing agency; 06/2001 to 06/2001 - factory worker through a staffing agency;
05/2001 to 05/2001 - unemployment; 02/2001 to 04/2001 - sales representative for a
security alarm service; 06/1999 to 01/2001 - regional sales representative for a computer
company; and 11/94 to 06/1999 - service technician for a systems company. Applicant also
disclosed in the e-QIP that he left the job with the security alarm service due to an
allegation of unsatisfactory performance.
Applicant has been married since September 1998. Two children have been born
of this marriage, ages ten and four. Applicant also has two children, ages 11 and 15, from
an earlier relationship. His wages are garnished about $650 per month for child support
and to liquidate a child support arrearage. 
 
Applicant attributes the beginning of his financial problems to his loss of
employment as a sales representative in January 2001. He testified he was earning about
$60,000 annually from that job and his income declined considerably thereafter. (Tr. 72)
His work history from January 2001 to October 2002,  as evidenced by the information
contained in the e-QIP, fully corroborates that testimony.
3
Applicant testified his finances were further strained when he and his wife separated
for a period of time in 2003, due to the increased expenses of maintaining two households
on their combined incomes. Following their reconciliation and into 2005, Applicant’s wife
was mobilized by the military reserve and stationed in the United States, but away from
home, for eighteen months. The record does not establish what loss of income, if any, they
experienced as a result of her military service. However, she currently works as a licensed
practical nurse (LPN), earning about $18 an hour, and serves as a corporal/specialist
(paygrade E-4) in the reserve, making it very likely that there was a loss of income while
she was activated. Finally, Applicant experienced a number of unplanned for emergency
expenses in the past several years. 
Applicant’s current net pay is about $2,400 per month. His wife works weekends and
her net monthly pay varies from about $1,400 to $1,990. According to Applicant, she also
earns about $180 per month from the reserves. However, her earning statement, dated
July 23, 2008, listed her net pay as $51.41, due in part to a thrift savings plan loan
repayment in the amount of $75.38. (GE 4) Applicant testified that after payment of his
mortgage, recurring monthly expenses, and payments on three debts, his monthly
discretionary income is about $540. 
Applicant submitted proof that he has fully satisfied the $803 collection debt listed
in SOR subparagraph 1.c with the payment of the negotiated settlement sum of $166.91.
He has also satisfied the collection accounts listed in subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f, which had
been owing in the combined amount of $186, by making payment-in-full. All three of these
accounts were paid in March 2009.
Applicant testified the $530 collection account listed in subparagraph 1.b arose from
the non-payment of the last month of cable service and the failure to return the cable box.
He admits he still has the cable box and that he did not pay for the last month of service,
but claims he cannot return the box or pay for the service because of the transfer of the
account to a collection agency and the sale of the original cable provider to another
company.
Applicant admits he is responsible for the other six collection accounts, owing in the
total amount of $16,261, and that he has not taken any action to resolve any of them. Each
of these debts are for medical expenses. Applicant testified the majority of this debt was
incurred when he experienced a serious medical emergency while he was either
unemployed or employed without insurance. When Department Counsel asked Applicant
if he had contacted his creditors, Applicant testified as follows:
I’ve talked to just about all the creditors at any given point. Whether I contact
them or they contact me. And when we discuss the account, if I have money
I will try to pay something and if they - - you know, they’ve tried to enter into
some kind of financial arrangement. And with the other debt that I have, the
other payments that I have, I just basically say I don’t have anything, I can’t
commit to anything right now. I will pay you as much as I can when I can. (Tr.

Applicant’s bank account statement for the period March 6, 2009 to April 6, 2009
(AE 3), discloses he and/or his wife visited either regular restaurants or fast food
restaurants on at least 22 occasions and spent over $300. They also disclose the purchase
of a video game at the cost of $102.20. When Applicant was asked why, considering the
pending hearing on the SOR, he and/or his wife weren’t willing to cut back on these type
expenses to at least satisfy some of the smaller debts listed in the SOR, Applicant’s only
response was: “I don’t have a good answer for that because I absolutely see your point and
I respect it.” (Tr. 79)          
   
POLICIES
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating
conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the5
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to6
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8

No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
The SOR alleges 10 accounts that were submitted for collection, owing in the
combined amount of $17,780. Each of these accounts had been delinquent for at least a
couple of years to as much as eight years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations
apply.
Applicant’s financial problems commenced when he lost a higher paying job in
January 2001. He spent the next year and a half working at a variety of temporary positions
that were interrupted by two briefs periods of unemployment. His financial problems were
compounded by a marital separation and, in all likelihood, by his wife’s activation by the
military reserve. Additionally, the greatest portion of his delinquent debt is due to a medical
emergency he suffered in either 2001/02 while he was uninsured.
Applicant has been continuously employed by his present employer since October
2002. All of the significant problems to which he attributes his delinquent accounts were
resolved about four years ago. He has had contact with his delinquent creditors, but he did
nothing to resolve any of the debts listed in the SOR until March 2009, four months after
issuance of the SOR. 
Applicant satisfied one creditor, owed $803, with a payment of $166.91. He satisfied
two other creditors, owed a total of $186, with payment-in-full. However, he has taken no
action to satisfy six creditors, owed a total of $16,261. As to the last outstanding debt
listed in the SOR, Applicant is unable to return the cable box due to the passage of time.
The collection agency is seeking payment as opposed to a return of the merchandise, and
Applicant has done nothing to satisfy the debt.
6
The 22 restaurant visits and game purchase disclosed in Applicant’s bank statement
would not normally be considered inappropriate. However, considering the long-standing
delinquent debt and the pendency of the SOR, spending disposable income in that fashion
exhibits a lack of judgment and continuing financial irresponsibility.    
Based on the above, I find Applicant has not acted responsibly since the problems
that created his delinquent accounts were resolved. He continues to exhibit financial
irresponsibility and poor judgment in resolving his delinquent debt. Waiting until four
months after issuance of the SOR, and then satisfying only a few of the smaller debts that
were owing, especially in consideration of the discretionary income Applicant testified was
available to him, does not exhibit a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors.
  
Accordingly, I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions
that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss
of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce
or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): .
. . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC
20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts do not apply. 
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
Indeed, the “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of
their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the
financial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor
satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a & b: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.e & f: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.g - j: Against Applicant
7
Conclusion               
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
