 Remand Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant used marijuana from January 2002 until November 26, 2008. He was
charged with possession of marijuana on August 8, 2008. He was convicted of that offense
in or about October 2008, and placed on six months unsupervised probation. Applicant
failed to mitigate the security concerns created by his abuse of marijuana. Clearance is
denied.  
On February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and J (criminal
conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, dated March 4, 2009, in which he
admitted all SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without
a hearing.

Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 28, 2009,
that was mailed to Applicant the same day. Applicant was notified he had 30 days from
receipt of the FORM to submit objections thereto or any additional information he wanted
considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on May 11, 2009. He did not
object to anything contained in the FORM or submit any additional information for
consideration. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2009.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 25-year-old single man who has been employed as a digital design
engineer by a defense contractor since July 2008. He graduated from high school and a
community college in June 2002.  He received a bachelor of arts degree in physics and a2
bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in June 2006. He is currently working
toward a master of science degree in electrical and computer engineering. He worked as
a salesman from June 2006 until August 2006, as a design engineer from September 2006
until July 2008, and as a tutor from May 2008 until July 2008. He was unemployed from
August 2006 until September 2006. He held a variety of jobs while he attended college. 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on July 14, 2008. In response to a question asking if he had illegally used a controlled
substance in the preceding seven years, Applicant admitted he used marijuana an
undisclosed number of times between January 2002 and July 2008. He elaborated by
stating:
I recreationally smoked marijuana while in college, but when my course work
became more intense and when my occupations became more professional
my recreational activities went to the wayside. I currently smoke marijuana
as infrequently as 1 to 3 times a year when I am on vacation. Coincidentally
my last time I smoked marijuana was inbetween [sic] jobs when I was
celebrating the 4  of July with my friends. . . . th
On December 16, 2008, in response to interrogatories propounded to him by DOHA,
Applicant acknowledged he last used of marijuana on November 26, 2008. He also
asserted he decided after that last use that he would not again use marijuana because of
the recent trouble it had caused him and because he feared he would lose the
opportunities presented to him by his current employment. 
Applicant now works in a different state from where most of his marijuana use
occurred. His current work and social lifestyle leave him neither the time nor desire to
smoke marijuana. However, in his response to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant
acknowledged that five to six times a year he returns to the state where he formerly resided
and visits with a couple of friends who continue to use marijuana.   
 The date entered on the sentencing document included as part of FORM Item 6 is  illegible. However, the dates3
on other documents in the FORM pertaining to the conviction indicate it occurred in October 2008, or earlier.

Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana on August 8, 2008. He was
convicted of that offense in or about October 2008.  Applicant was sentenced to serve six3
months unsupervised probation, fined $512.50, ordered to perform 25 hours community
service, and required to obtain a drug evaluation. He successfully completed these
conditions of probation. On November 4, 2008, Applicant obtained the court-ordered drug
evaluation. The person conducting the evaluation concluded Applicant did not require
treatment. Applicant was ordered to not consume alcohol or drugs while on probation. He
violated this condition of probation when he smoked marijuana on November 26, 2008. 
In his response to the FORM, Applicant wrote:
I believe that guidelines J and H are the same. I agree with them that illegal
drug use reflects that one wouldn’t be willing to comply with laws . . . but I
disagree with it on its poor reflection on a persons reliability and
trustworthiness. I am a very reliable and trustworthy person, I just make
mistakes. 
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this
policy guidance. Guidelines H (drug involvement) and J (criminal conduct), with their
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of4 5
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of7

the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant8
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable9
clearance decision.10
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard11
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access12
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      13
Analysis
Guideline H, Drug Involvement
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and
because it raises questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws,
rules, and regulations.
Applicant illegally used marijuana an undisclosed number of times between January
2002 and November 26, 2008. As of July 14, 2008, he admitted using it about one to three
times a year while he was on vacation. He was convicted of possession of marijuana and
placed on six months probation in or before October 2008. He obtained a drug evaluation
on November 4, 2008. His last reported use of marijuana occurred after he submitted his
e-QIP, while he was on probation and after he obtained the drug evaluation. Disqualifying
Condition (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse applies.
Applicant last used marijuana less than seven months ago. On December 16, 2008,
he averred he will not use marijuana again because of the trouble it has recently caused
him and because of the risk it poses to opportunities that may arise from his current
employment. However, his use of marijuana after he submitted his e-QIP, while he was on
probation and after he obtained the drug evaluation indicate a very recent history of
ignoring the potential consequences of the illegal use of marijuana. While Applicant’s work
and lifestyle have recently changed, he still, on occasion, visits with friends who continue
to abuse marijuana. Having considered all potential mitigating conditions, I conclude that
the above factors preclude finding that any mitigating condition applies. 
5
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and
trustworthiness; and, by its very nature, calls into question a person’s ability or willingness
to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  
Applicant illegally used marijuana from January 2002 until November 26, 2008. He
was convicted of possession of marijuana and placed on six months probation in or before
October 2008. His use of marijuana on November 26, 2008, was in violation of a term of
his probation. DC 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; 31(c): allegation
or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,
formally prosecuted or convicted; and 31(e): violation of parole or probation. . . apply.    
Applicant abused marijuana for over seven years and as recently as less than seven
months ago. Although he has asserted he will never use marijuana again, he still, at least
on occasion, associates with friends who abuse marijuana. His recent history of drug
abuse and the circumstances under which the most recent use occurred, as described
above, preclude application of any mitigating condition. 
I have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, including Applicant’s age, his educational and work history, the period of time that
has elapsed since his last reported use of marijuana, the whole person concept, the factors
listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions.
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his abuse of a controlled
substance and the criminal conduct issues that arise therefrom. He has not overcome the
case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - d: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a - c: Against Applicant
6
Conclusion               
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
