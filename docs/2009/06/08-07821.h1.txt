ABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge: 
 
Several of Applicant’s debts became delinquent due to circumstances beyond his 
control. After he received his current employment, he demonstrated a meaningful track 
record of debt repayment. He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 1, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 16, 
2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the 
basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified 
information, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The 
action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On November 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed 
on December 2, 2008. On February 12, 2009, the case was assigned to another 
administrative judge. Applicant requested a delay and the case was transferred to me 
on March 10, 2009. On April 1, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was 
held on April 21, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-
4) (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12), and Applicant offered five exhibits (AE A-E) (Tr. 13-17). 
There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 (Tr. 12-13), and AE A-E (Tr. 17). 
Additionally, I admitted the Second Notice of Hearing, Notice of Cancellation of Hearing, 
First Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GEs 5-9). I received the 
transcript on April 29, 2009. I held the record open until May 22, 2009, to provide 
Applicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence (Tr. 50-51, 58). However, he did 
not provide any post-hearing evidence.    
   
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.d to 1.g; and he denied responsibility for SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, and 1.h (GE 9). 
His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Since January 
2008, he has provided instructor services to soldiers on a military installation about how 
to use various simulators (Tr. 36). Applicant has never been married (Tr. 47). 
 
Applicant attended the U.S. Army Military Academy Preparatory School 
(USAMAPS) and then the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York (USMA) (Tr. 
18; AE A). When Applicant was a senior at USMA, he suffered a head injury while 
playing Rugby for USMA and was medically separated from Army service on May 24, 
2004 (Tr. 19, 45; AE A). Applicant suffered from a depressive-mood disorder as a result 
of his head injury (AE A). However, he did not receive a military medical retirement (Tr. 
30). He received a Veterans Affairs disability rating of 60%, which pays $974 a month 
(Tr. 30-31). He does not receive any other disability payments (Tr. 31). 
 
After Applicant’s discharge from the Army, he worked as a security supervisor 
(Tr. 23-24). In 2006-2007, he returned to school because he needed about 30 credits to 
obtain his bachelor’s degree (Tr. 23-24). However, he was unable to complete 
requirements and obtain a degree because of issues of depression and difficulty 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
concentrating (Tr. 24, 35). He would like to return to college on a part-time basis and 
complete his degree (Tr. 35).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant served on active duty as an enlisted soldier for two years, including one 
year at USAMAPS (Tr. 22). He received a small salary for four years while he attended 
USMA (Tr. 22). After Applicant was discharged from the Army, his income was low (Tr. 
19). His social security records show the following income (does not include disability 
payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)) for the years 2004 to 2007: 
2004-$8,387; 2005-$13,710; 2006-$5,736; and 2007-$2,886 (AE B).  
 
Applicant borrowed money while he was a USMA cadet (Tr. 20). His largest loan 
was known as a “Career Starter Loan” for $25,000, which was provided to USMA 
cadets by a large bank as they approach graduation (Tr. 20; SOR ¶ 1.f). He borrowed 
for uniforms and to purchase a car (Tr. 21-22). The source, status, and amount of his 
individual SOR debts are more specifically described as follows (paragraph letters 
correspond with the SOR subparagraphs): 
  
(a) Debt for $942 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); 
 
(b) Debt for $125 (SOR ¶ 1.b). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); 
 
(c) Debt for $144 (SOR ¶ 1.c). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); 
 
(d) Credit card debt for $4,058 (SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant has not paid anything on 
this debt (Tr. 37-38). The creditor declined to allow a payment plan, and Applicant is 
saving money to pay this debt with a lump sum payment on September 1, 2009 (Tr. 28-
29, 38); 
 
(e) Credit card debt for $1,320 (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant has not paid anything on 
this debt (Tr. 37-38). The creditor declined to allow a payment plan, and Applicant has 
saved enough money to pay this debt with a single payment on June 1, 2009 (Tr. 28-29, 
38);  
 
(f) Credit card debt for $24,174 (SOR ¶ 1.f). He said he had been making 
payments for a longer period than he had documentary evidence showing such 
payments (Tr. 37). He provided proof of payments on the following dates in the listed 
amounts: January 31, 2009 for $125; February 28, 2009 for $125; and March 31, 2009 
for $150 (Tr. 36; AE E); 
 
(g) Debt for $536 (SOR ¶ 1.g). He made a payment of February 28, 2009 to 
settle and pay this debt for $412 (Tr. 25-26, 36; AE D);   
 
(h) Debt for $612 (SOR ¶ 1.h). Applicant denied owing this debt (Tr. 27). He 
provided a cancelled check to the creditor to corroborate that he had paid the creditor 
 
 
4 
 
(Tr. 27, 41). However, he did not retain the documentation, and so he said he would pay 
the debt again (Tr. 42-45). 
 
Applicant denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c (Tr. 27). He investigated these 
three debts, and all he was able to discover was that the debts pertained to medical 
services (Tr. 27). He received all medical assistance from Army and VA hospitals (Tr. 
31-32). The creditors were not able to provide sufficient information for Applicant to 
verify the authenticity of or his responsibility for the three debts (Tr. 27).  
 
Applicant borrowed $3,000 from his aunt to repair his vehicle and he needed to 
make payments to her (Tr. 39). He paid that debt and is making payments on his other 
debts (Tr. 39). Applicant does not have any other credit cards (Tr. 40). 
 
Applicant promised to repay his creditors and emphasized he had proven his 
intention to make restitution to his creditors (Tr. 24-25, 57). He made three payments 
totaling $500 on a non-SOR-listed student loan of $1,175 to bring it to current status: 
February 2, 2009 for $200; February 22, 2009 for $200; and March 1, 2009 for $100 (Tr. 
25, 33; AE C). He now pays $60 monthly on this debt using an automatic allotment (Tr. 
25). The student loan resulted from his college attendance in 2006 to 2007 (Tr. 32).  
 
Applicant’s gross pay (including his disability pay) is about $3,800 monthly (Tr. 
40-41; GE 2). His monthly deductions are $692 and his monthly expenses are $1,375 
(GE 2). His personal financial statement shows monthly payments of $200 for a student 
loan, $220 for a personal loan, $125 for a commercial bank loan (SOR ¶ 1.f), and $100 
for another student loan (GE 2). He has about $1,000 monthly remaining to address his 
other SOR debts (Tr. 40-41). Applicant has about $650 in his savings account (Tr. 38). 
He has about $2,000 in his 401K plan (Tr. 38). His vehicle, a 1996 Lexus, is paid off (Tr. 
38-39).   
 
Applicant has always been honest about his financial problems. When Applicant 
submitted his SF-86 on February 1, 2008, he provided a list of debts that were 
delinquent in the last seven years for more than 180 days (GE 1). He did not receive 
any credit counseling (Tr. 41). 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
 
5 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
 
 
6 
 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and, “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent 
debt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR 
response and at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The 
government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further 
inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. 
   
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  
 
Applicant receives full credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of his injury at USMA and his subsequent unemployment and 
underemployment. He receives substantial mitigating credit because his delinquent 
debts “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” He established that 
he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g and has been making payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. 
He has a plan to pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e with a single lump sum payment, 
and those two debts should be resolved by September 1, 2009.   
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and 
therefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” for the reasons stated 
in the preceding paragraph. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt 
and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some, but 
not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed substantial good faith2 in the 
resolution of his SOR debts.    
 
Applicant contests the validity of the remaining four debts, which total less than 
$2,000. However, he did not provide documentation contesting these four debts. He 
credibly promised to pay these four debts if he could establish their validity. His overall 
conduct over the last 17 months with his creditors shows he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.3 AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because he did not provide corroborating 
documentation showing his disputes of any of his SOR debts. 
 
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                            
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he established the full applicability 
of AG ¶ 20(b). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the “Whole Person 
Concept,” infra at pages 8-10.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct. Several of 
Applicant’s debts became delinquent years ago. In January 2008, he began his present 
employment; however, he should have made greater progress on his debts because he 
has about $1,000 monthly remaining after deductions, expenses and debt payments. He 
admitted responsibility for four delinquent SOR debts. He failed to obtain financial 
counselling. He showed some effort in 2008 and 2009 to resolve his delinquent debts, 
but could have acted more aggressively to pay his delinquent debts, to seek debt 
repayment or resolution, and to better document his remedial efforts. These factors 
show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt 
raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current 
financial problems were caused by three factors beyond his control: (1) his injury, (2) 
 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
9 
 
unemployment, and (3) underemployment. He paid one SOR debt. He is making 
payments on his largest SOR debt. He has a plan to pay two other SOR debts by 
September 1, 2009. He is making payments on his non-SOR student loan. He paid off a 
non-SOR, personal loan for $3,000. He has ample income to pay his debts. The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Although Applicant is only 31 years old, he has achieved some important 
educational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and 
dedication. He served on active duty for six years, including almost four years at USMA. 
In 2004, he received a brain injury, which dramatically changed his prospects for 
financial security, and his debts became delinquent. His severe injury was in the line of 
duty, and he is receiving 60% disability from the VA. He obtained employment in 
January 2008 with a government contractor, and he is continuing to support the Army. 
He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial 
responsibility. Clearly, he could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts, after 
receiving employment with a government contractor. There is, however, simply no 
reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a “meaningful track record” of 
debt payments by paying one SOR debt, making payments on his largest SOR debt, 
and making payments on his student loan. He has a plan to pay two SOR debts by 
September 1, 2009 with a lump sum payment to each creditor. The four remaining, 
unaddressed SOR debts are of questionable validity and total less than $2,000; 
nevertheless, he has promised to pay them if he can establish they are valid debts. I 
found his statement to be candid, forthright and credible. Applicant has demonstrated 
his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of 
 
 
10 
 
Defense as a contractor and to the U.S. Army. These factors, especially his past 
government service, show sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate security 
concerns.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information.
