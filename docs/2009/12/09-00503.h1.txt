HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling 
$26,848. She paid two debts. Seven student loans were duplicated in the SOR. She 
consolidated her student loans into one debt for $7,784, and established a payment 
plan. She has established payment plans on all of the other SOR debts, except for three 
debts, which total $6,867. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated, and 
eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 26, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 22 and July, 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (Transcript (Tr.) 
14-15; GE 9). On September 18, 2009, Department Counsel announced he was ready 
to proceed on his case. On September 28, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On October 1, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). On October 23, 2009, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits 
(GE 1-6) (Tr. 29-30), and Applicant offered eight exhibits (Tr. 31-35; AE A-H). There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 30), and AE A-H (Tr. 35-36). 
Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On 
November 2, 2009, I received the transcript. After her hearing, Applicant provided nine 
exhibits (AE I-Q), which were admitted into evidence without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d to 
1.i (GE 9). She established that that she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($45) (GE 9 at 3-4). 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.i and 1.n and 1.o pertained to delinquent student loans 
(GE 9 at 5-7).2 On March 23, 2009, she received an offer of a repayment schedule with 
a $125 monthly payment starting on March 27, 2009, to address a balance owed on six 
student loan accounts of $8,302 (GE 9 at 6). A handwritten note indicated the medical 
debt of $228 in SOR ¶ 1.p was settled for $148 and paid using a money gram (GE 9 at 
9-10). A March 18, 2009, letter from the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.r ($1,671), 1.s ($2,110), 
and 1.t ($563) indicated the debts were transferred to a different creditor (GE 9 at 19).  
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6). In 1989, she 
graduated from high school, and she has completed some credits towards her 
bachelor’s degree (Tr. 6, 36). She majored in business administration (Tr. 7).  She has 
never been married and does not have any children (Tr. 7). Her September 26, 2008, 
security clearance application describes her delinquent debts and two judgments (GE 
1). It does not list any other reportable incidents involving illegal drugs, alcohol, the 
police, or courts (GE 1).    
 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
2 Department Counsel conceded in his opening statement that there were duplications of her 
student loans and the actual number of student loans was seven totaling about $8,000, as opposed to the 
14 student loans listed on the SOR (Tr. 20, 89).

Financial considerations 
 
The SOR listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling $26,848. Six SOR debts are 
unrelated to student loans: ¶ 1.a (apartment lease—$1,222); ¶ 1.b (apartment lease—
$4,315); ¶ 1.c (pizza—$45); ¶ 1.k (telecommunications—$356); ¶ 1.l (judgment 
medical—$1,330); and ¶ 1.p (medical—$228). The remaining 14 SOR debts are all from 
student loans: ¶ 1.d ($423); ¶ 1.e ($579); ¶ 1.f ($2,168); ¶ 1.g ($1,717); ¶ 1.h ($1,084); ¶ 
1.i ($1,648); ¶ 1.j ($1,013); ¶ 1.m ($2,720); ¶ 1.n ($991); ¶ 1.o ($1,061); ¶ 1.q ($1,604); 
¶ 1.r ($1,671); ¶ 1.s ($2,110); and ¶ 1.t ($563) (Tr. 64-71).  
 
After graduation from high school, Applicant worked at a drug store, for the 
airlines, at a bank, at a hotel, and in the travel industry (Tr. 37-38, 43-44). She was 
unemployed from July 2002 to March 2003 and from about November 2004 to August 
2005 and in 2007 for several months (Tr. 44-46; GE 1). After she lost her job in 2007 
she was financially devastated (Tr. 46). In July 2007, she was evicted and her car was 
repossessed (Tr. 24, 28-29). She received her current employment in July 2007 as a 
temporary employee, and then was hired as a full-time employee in September 2007 
(Tr. 47-49). On February 27, 2009, she paid the $5,229 debt related to her repossessed 
vehicle (Tr. 47-48; GE 4 at 4).   
 
Fourteen SOR debts are related to Applicant’s student loans: ¶ 1.d ($423); ¶ 1.e 
($579); ¶ 1.f ($2,168); ¶ 1.g ($1,717); ¶ 1.h ($1,084); ¶ 1.i ($1,648); ¶ 1.j ($1,013); ¶ 1.m 
($2,720); ¶ 1.n ($991); ¶ 1.o ($1,061); ¶ 1.q ($1,604); ¶ 1.r ($1,671); ¶ 1.s ($2,110); and 
¶ 1.t ($563) (Tr. 64-71). Applicant attended college for about five semesters from 1989 
to 1990 and then part time from 2001 to 2002 (Tr. 37-40). From 2001 to 2002, she 
received six student loans totaling $6,624 under the Stafford program in the amounts of: 
$458; $1,750; $1,333; $875; $1,333; and $875 (GE 9 at 11). The seventh student loan 
was for about $2,000 and was evidently paid off in 2008 when her $2,600 federal tax 
refund was diverted and applied to her delinquent student loans (Tr. 65-73, 84-85; GE 2 
at 12-18; GE 9 at 11). She had difficulty locating the current creditor of her student loans 
because the loans were transferred to different collection companies (Tr. 25, 28-29). 
Over the last seven years, she made some payments and received some deferments 
on her student loans (Tr. 40).  
 
Applicant said she could not afford her student loan payments because her rent 
expenses and car payments did not leave enough money to make payments on her 
student loan (Tr. 22, 28-29).  On March 23, 2009, she received a payoff figure of $8,302 
for all of her education loans with a $125 per month payment plan (AE J). She agreed to 
this payment plan (AE B, J, K). On September 11, 2009, she received an updated 
payoff figure of $7,784 for her education loans (AE K). Her loan statement of October 
29, 2009, showed outstanding interest owed of $6, indicating her payment plan was 
current (AE L at 2). 
 
Applicant promised to begin addressing her debt in SOR ¶ 1.a (apartment 
lease—$1,222) after she pays some of her other debts (Tr. 50-51).  The creditor offered 
to settle the debt for $800 (Tr. 51). She made a $25 payment on November 9, 2009 (AE 
P).

The creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b (apartment lease—$4,315) offered to 
settle for a $3,600 lump sum (Tr. 52). The collection agency has obtained a judgment 
for $2,398 for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b (Tr. 53; GE 2 at 27). 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c (pizza—$45) resulted from a check returned for 
insufficient funds (Tr. 54). She established that that she paid this debt (Tr. 54-55; GE 9 
at 3-4).   
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($356) related to a telecommunications account (Tr. 55). 
She has been paying $100 per month for about seven months, and had reduced the 
debt from $900 to $200 (Tr. 55-56). 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l (judgment—$1,330) relates to medical treatment Applicant 
received at an emergency room in 2006 (Tr. 57-59). She did not have medical 
insurance (Tr. 57-59). Applicant has made two $125 payments to this creditor (Tr. 58). 
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.p (medical—$228) relates to Applicant’s visit to an 
emergency room (Tr. 61). She did not have medical insurance. Applicant paid this debt 
(Tr. 61-64; GE 9 at 10). 
 
Applicant’s monthly gross pay is $5,039 and her monthly net pay is $3,456 (AE 
M). Her monthly expenses total $2,424 (AE M, O). Her monthly rent is $1,099, and her 
rent is current (AE M, Q). Her debt payments include the following monthly payments: 
$125 for her student loan; $50 for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a; $157 for a debt consolidation 
loan; $487 for her car loan (Tr. 83); and $100 for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k (AE M). Her 
monthly remainder after deducting her expenses and debt payments is $113 (AE M). 
Her car loan amount is $13,000 (Tr. 83; AE O). Applicant received financial counseling 
as documented by her personal finance management information sheet and personal 
financial statement (AE M, O).  
 
Character evidence 
 
Applicant’s evaluations describe her as an exceptional employee with a positive, 
can-do attitude (AE C). She treats others with respect, and accepts responsibility for her 
actions and decisions (AE C). She is diligent, responsible, competent, and professional 
(AE D). She shows flexibility, adaptability, appropriate initiative, and good judgment (AE 
D). 
 
A July 23, 2009, email from a customer lauded Applicant’s hard work, 
organization skills, and attention to detail (AE H). A U.S. Navy Captain, who has known 
Applicant from June 2007 to September 2008, was impressed with Applicant’s positive 
attitude, hard work, and desire to improve herself and her organization (AE F). He noted 
her increasing competence and value to her organization (AE F). He highly 
recommended her for employment in administration (AE F).

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted, “Applicant’s 
credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR Case 
No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is 
documented in her credit reports, her OPM interview, her responses to DOHA 
interrogatories, her SOR response, and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to 
ensure her creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating 
conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She did not resolve all of her delinquent 
SOR debts through payment, established payment plans or disputes.   
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(c) apply. Applicant had three periods of unemployment in 
the period July 2002 to July 2007, with her most recent unemployment causing the most 
adverse financial impact. She was evicted from her apartment, her student loans 
became delinquent, and her vehicle was repossessed.  
 
The Appeal Board’s discussion of AG ¶ 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an 
Applicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after 
circumstances outside an applicant’s control cause delinquent debt.  In ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 
for $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 
(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). 
These three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included 
significant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the 
applicant’s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated 
about $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and 
three debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 
(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment 
plan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal 
Board at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, 
 
.  .  .  what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the 
circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not “responsible” in 
light of his limited circumstances.    
 
Once Applicant returned to full-time employment in September 2007, she worked 
diligently to pay their creditors.3 For example, she paid the $5,229 debt related to her 
repossessed vehicle. She received financial counseling, and generated a budget. She 
paid two debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.p). She established a payment plan for her 
consolidated student loan, and paid her telecommunications debt from $900 down to 
$200 over the seven months prior to her hearing (SOR ¶ 1.k). She paid $250 towards 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l and $25 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a. She has not made any 
payments to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b, who wants a $3,600 lump sum payment. She 
has contacted all of her SOR creditors and knows what she must do to resolve her 
debts. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are clear 
indications that her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. She has 
established her financial responsibility.   
 
Applicant does not receive full mitigation under AG ¶¶ 20(d) or 20(e). She did not 
establish good faith4 in the resolution of her SOR debts because she did not adequately 
demonstrate her efforts to pay her debts in the first year after she received her current 
employment. She did not show sufficient adherence to her obligations. AG ¶ 20(e) 
applies to the student loans that were duplicated. The record establishes that the seven 
student loans were duplicated in the SOR. In 2009, her student loans were consolidated 
into one debt, which in September 2009 amounted to $7,784.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her debts resulted from unemployment, (two 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

debts were due to medical problems, and she did not have medical insurance). Her 
SOR listed 20 delinquent debts, totaling $26,848. She paid two debts. Fourteen of the 
SOR debts related to student loans, which were consolidated into a single payment 
plan, in which she owes $7,784. She has established payment plans on all of the other 
SOR debts, except for three debts, which total $6,867 (her total of $275 in payments 
towards these three debts are not sufficient to establish a payment plan). I am confident 
she will keep her promise to pay her delinquent debts5 because of her sufficient track 
record of financial progress shown over the last year.     
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
    
  The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant; however, they do not warrant revocation of her security clearance. 
Applicant’s failure to pay or resolve her just debts in accordance with contacts she 
signed was not prudent or responsible. She has a history of financial problems. Her 
2008 and 2009 credit reports listed delinquent debts including two judgments.  
      
 
5 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case 
No. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary 
security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her 
financial problems.” and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.

The rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant’s clearance is more substantial. 
She was forthright and candid in her security clearance application, her responses to 
DOHA interrogatories, her responses to an OPM investigator, her SOR response, and 
at her hearing about her financial problems. Several problems beyond her control 
adversely affected her financial status. Her debts resulted from unemployment, (two 
debts were due to medical problems, and she did not have medical insurance). 
Fourteen of the SOR debts related to student loans, which were consolidated into a 
single payment plan, in which she owes $7,784. She paid two debts. She has 
established payment plans for all of her other SOR debts, except for three debts, which 
total $6,867 (her total of $275 in payments towards these three debts are not sufficient 
to establish a payment plan). I am confident she will keep her promise to pay her 
delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person 
analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant is 38 years old. She has achieved some important educational and 
employment goals, demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. Her 
financial problems were caused by her unemployment, rather than by her misconduct or 
irresponsible spending. Before her employment problems, she did not have any 
delinquent debts. Applicant is an intelligent person, and she understands how to budget 
and what she needs to do to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. Clearly, 
she could have acted more aggressively to resolve her debts, after receiving 
employment with a government contractor in September 2007. There is, however, 
simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a “meaningful track 
record” of debt re-payment.

Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through 
her service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. A character witness 
described Applicant as highly professional and diligent. Her evaluations document her 
solid work performance and good character. She is an asset to her corporation. Her 
security clearance application does not list any other reportable incidents involving 
illegal drugs, alcohol, the police, or courts.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors,”6 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. I conclude 
she has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for 
access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.t:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
