Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate trustworthiness concerns regarding her delinquent 
debts under Guideline F (financial considerations). She failed to adequately mitigate 
eight debts totaling $15,012. Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 25, 2005, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust 
Positions (SF 85P) (Government Exhibit (GE) 2). On March 23, 2009, she completed an 
SF 85P (GE 1). On May 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 10), pursuant to Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised; 
Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
 
1 Department Counsel noted the case was an ADP case rather than an ISCR case. With consent 
of the parties, I changed the statement of reasons to indicate the case is an ADP case (Tr. 15-16).

Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Regulation that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which 
entails access to sensitive information. DOHA recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such access to sensitive information should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On March 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (GE 11). On 
September 3, 2009, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On 
September 14, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 9). On October 14, 2009, the 
hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight 
exhibits (GE 1-8) (Tr. 19-22), and Applicant offered seven exhibits (Tr. 27-30; AE A-G). 
Applicant objected to the admissibility of four credit reports because she had 
successfully disputed the accuracy of the credit reports (Tr. 22; GE 4-7; AG F). I 
admitted the documents and noted the information about the successful disputes went 
to the weight rather than to the admissibility of documents (Tr. 24). There were no other 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-8 (Tr. 24), and AE A-G (Tr. 30). Additionally, I admitted 
the SOR, response to the SOR, and hearing notice (GE 9-11). I received the transcript 
on October 22, 2009. On December 15, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded AE H to 
Z to me without objection, and I admitted AE H to Z into evidence.  I closed the record 
on December 16, 2009. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations in her SOR response without 
elaboration (GE 11). She did not make any admissions. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 22 delinquent debts totaling 
$18,872. She has made $300 payments in August, September and October 2009, to 
address one SOR debt (Tr. 75-76). She has not made any other payments to any of her 
other SOR creditors.  
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). She has 
been continuously employed by the same employer since June 1996 (Tr. 32; GE 1). 
From June 2005 to June 2006, she was employed by another large defense contractor 
(GE 1 at 3). Her primary work for the last several years has been as a software trainer. 
From January 2005 to June 2005, she was employed by another corporation (GE 1 at 
3). She has never served in the military (Tr. 34; GE 2).  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

In 1967, Applicant graduated from high school (Tr. 7). She attended college from 
1967 to 1971 and majored in education (Tr. 8; GE 2). She subsequently completed 
sufficient college courses to maintain her teaching certificate (Tr. 32). She has not 
received a degree (Tr. 8, 37). She erroneously indicated on her 2005 SF 85P that she 
had a bachelor of arts degree (Tr. 37; GE 2). The college she attended from 1967 to 
1971 has closed and she does not have her transcript (Tr. 38). She does not have the 
ability to corroborate her attendance at college from 1967 to 1971 (Tr. 38). She has 
never held a security clearance (Tr. 9). 
 
Applicant married in 1986, and she was divorced in 1988 (Tr. 7). She married the 
second time in 1989, and she was divorced in 1992 (Tr. 8).3 She has one child, a son, 
who is 38 years old (Tr. 8; GE 2).  
 
Applicant’s file does not include any adverse information about her being fired 
from a job, leaving employment under adverse circumstances, or relating to police 
involvement. For example, there is no evidence she has ever been charged with a 
felony or any firearms or explosives offense(s), or that she has any currently pending 
charges. There is no evidence she has ever been charged with any offense related to 
alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that she has abused alcohol or drugs. In the 
financial information section of her March 23, 2009, SF 85P, she disclosed that she had 
debts currently delinquent over 90 days, and debts delinquent over 180 days in the last 
seven years (GE 1). She attached a credit report and a statement in which she denied 
receiving notice of her delinquent debts and a judgment. Applicant did not list any 
periods of unemployment in the last 12 years (GE 1, 2).     
 
Financial considerations 
 
The SOR listed 22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872 as follows: ¶ 1.a ($169); ¶ 
1.b ($5,732); ¶ 1.c ($1,410); ¶ 1.d ($98); ¶ 1.e ($3,250); ¶ 1.f ($329); ¶ 1.g ($188); ¶ 1.h 
($1,238); ¶ 1.i ($3,713); ¶ 1.j ($471); ¶ 1.k ($421); ¶ 1.l ($266); ¶ 1.m ($249); ¶ 1.n 
($207); ¶ 1.o ($40); ¶ 1.p ($152); ¶ 1.q ($110); ¶ 1.r ($87); ¶ 1.s ($151); ¶ 1.t ($60); ¶ 
1.u ($139); and ¶ 1.v ($392). 
 
In the last few years, Applicant has never been unemployed for a significant 
period of time, and she has received a good salary (Tr. 129-130). She has traveled 
frequently for work and did not take the time to ensure her creditors were paid or 
disputed debts were resolved (Tr. 130). She had to move after she lost her last job, and 
the move was expensive (Tr. 130). 
  
Applicant contacted the credit reporting companies and disputed her delinquent 
debts (Tr. 46). On February 17, 2009, TransUnion stated that Applicant had previously 
disputed her debts with respect the account in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($3,713) and 1.k ($421) (AE 
B). Because her latest dispute did not include any new information, TransUnion 
 
3At her hearing Applicant said she was married twice to the same man, and once to another man 
(Tr. 60). When she completed her 2005 and 2009 SF 85Ps, she indicated she was divorced; however, 
she did not list the name of her former spouse or the dates of her marriages or divorces (GE 1, GE 2).

considered the dispute to be frivolous (AE B). She did not provide any letters from 
TransUnion indicating any account information was disputed and removed from her 
credit reports. 
 
Credit repair company (KCCS) 
 
On September 23, 2008, Applicant signed an agreement with a credit repair 
company (KCCS) (AE K). She said she paid KCCS $1,000 to assist with correction of 
her credit reports (Tr. 48, 58, 126-127; GE 3 at 16; AE F).4 She provided her social 
security number to KCCS (Tr. 59). She received an undated and unsigned letter from 
KCCS, advising Applicant that they had successfully removed 14 inaccurate items from 
her credit report (Tr. 48; AE F at 1). In October 2009, Applicant asked KCCS for a list of 
the corrections (Tr. 47-48, 70). At her hearing, she conceded she had not set up any 
payment plans, except for the three payments to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.h (Tr. 109). 
She planned to change to a different credit repair company after she obtains the 
information about the inaccurate credit reports (Tr. 126, 151). I requested that she 
provide a copy of her contract with KCCS after her hearing, and she provided part of it 
(Tr. 70-71, 146; AE K).5 Her KCCS contract does not authorize KCCS to negotiate with 
creditors to set up payment plans, and is focused on removing obsolete or incorrect 
information from credit reports (AE K). Information is obsolete under the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act after seven years (AE K at 3).  
 
On October 19, 2009, KCCS sent Applicant a brief email listing her debts and 
creditors. The KCCS email listed five creditors and seven accounts (AE L). All five 
creditors were listed on the SOR. The KCCS email did not provide specific information 
about the amounts owed on those seven accounts or the account numbers for the 
seven accounts (AE L). The documentation from creditors or credit reporting companies 
supporting the KCCS email was not provided. 
  
SOR ¶ 1.a ($169)—SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. Applicant’s 
September 20, 2007, and August 17, 2008, credit reports list a revolving credit card 
account opened in 1993 with a balance of $169 (Tr. 42-45; GE 6 at 4; GE 3 at 37). The 
creditor charged off $169 in July 2001 (GE 6 at 4). Applicant called this creditor and 
several others, and the creditors asked for Applicant’s social security number to verify 
her identity (Tr. 44). Applicant declined to provide her social security number and the 
creditor declined to provide information about Applicant’s account (Tr. 44, 57-58). She 
wanted to verify that she signed a contract for a credit card with the creditor (Tr. 55). 
She denied that she had an account with the creditor, and said she reviewed her 
checkbook and was unable to locate any payments to the account (Tr. 55). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($5,732)—SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt 
related to business expenses charged on Applicant’s credit card in 2005 and 2006 
during her employment that ended in June 2006 (Tr. 88-90; GE 1). Applicant charged 
 
4Applicant did not provide documentary proof of any payments to KCCS.   
 
5The information from KCCS did not indicate how much she was supposed to pay KCCS (AE K).   
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
about $5,500 on a credit card, which was never paid. In 2006 and 2005, Applicant went 
on numerous work-related trips (Tr. 39; GE 3 at 42-66). Her employer was supposed to 
pay the creditor directly (Tr. 89). On November 25, 2006, Applicant emailed her 
corporate supervisor and asked for help with two discrepancies, including one for 
$5,000, that were related to her travel account (Tr. 89-90; GE 3 at 44). On November 
28, 2006, her supervisor provided very detailed spreadsheets concerning her travel 
expenses in 2005 and 2006, and suggested that Applicant identify any discrepancies 
(GE 3 at 42). Her supervisor asked Applicant to do her analysis as quickly as possible 
because the employer would soon not be able to assist with the reconciliation (GE 3 at 
42). The spreadsheet shows a delinquent amount of $5,973 (Tr. 90; GE 3 at 48 line 
one). She said she sent her employer an expense report for $5,000 that was not 
included on her spreadsheet (Tr. 132-133); however, she did not describe the content of 
the expense report. In the last several months, Applicant did not make any payments to 
address this debt (Tr. 95). I asked her to provide her last expense report so that I could 
compare it to her employer’s spreadsheet and determine whether or not she received 
credit for her expenses (Tr. 134). She was unable to locate a copy of her last expense 
report and on October 29, 2009, she sent an email to her former employer seeking a 
copy (AE M). She provided an email from another employee whose last expense claim 
was not resolved for three years (AE P).  
 
On November 3, 2009, Applicant’s former employer explained that Applicant 
failed to submit her expenses for reimbursement within 90 days of the incur date (AE R 
at 3). She failed to complete the filing process early in 2007 to resolve the dispute (AE R 
at 3).6 The analysis indicated she failed to submit several hotel bills from April and May 
2006, with her claims (AE R at 4), and concluded that the related government contract 
is closed, making recovery of the costs from the government problematic (AE R at 6).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,410)—SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt 
related to Applicant declining to pay her credit card debt because she considered the 
fees and penalties for late payments to be excessive (Tr. 96-99). She opened her 
account in 2000 (Tr. 102; GE 7 at 6). The creditor charged off $1,104 in October 2001 
(Tr. 102-103; GE 7 at 6). Eventually the creditor doubled the amount she owed from 
fees, penalties, and interest (Tr. 101-102). She attempted to negotiate a settlement; 
however, she stated the creditor was unreasonable (Tr. 99-100).7  
     
SOR ¶ 1.d ($98)—DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. This debt related to a 
telecommunications account (Tr. 104-105; GE 7 at 11). She denied knowledge of the 
account (GE 3 at 6). She sent the creditor a letter seeking authentication of the debt (Tr. 
 
6An email dated January 17, 2007, and spreadsheet from Applicant’s employer notes that she 
may not have filed about $6,500 in hotel expenses and suggests she obtain a receipt from a particular 
hotel and provide it to her employer (AE S, T). There is no evidence that Applicant provided the requested 
receipt to her employer.   
 
7This debt apparently does not appear in Applicant’s current credit report because there has not 
been any activity on the account for more than seven years, and the information was deleted because it 
was obsolete. See KCCS agreement (AE K).  
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
105; letter is similar to the letter at AE C at 1). She did not receive a reply from the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d (Tr. 105). She did not pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d (Tr. 106).   
   
SOR ¶ 1.e ($3,250)—SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt 
related to Applicant breaking her lease on an apartment in 2003 (Tr. 77-78, 81). Her 
father was ill and she needed to move (Tr. 78). She failed to give the 60-day notice as 
required in her contract (Tr. 78). She admitted that she erroneously denied responsibility 
for this debt in her SOR response (Tr. 79). She has not contacted the creditor (Tr. 80). 
She believed KCCS would contact the creditor and discuss a settlement for perhaps 
less than $2,000 (Tr. 81). She has not paid anything to this creditor in the last six years 
(Tr. 82). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($329)—DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. This debt was listed in 
Applicant’s September 20, 2007 credit report (Tr. 106; GE 6 at 10). However, Applicant 
did not recognize the name of the creditor and her 2007 credit report did not include an 
address for contacting the creditor (Tr. 106; GE 3 at 9).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($188)—DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. Applicant’s credit report 
indicates this debt is to a bank (Tr. 107). Applicant had an account with the bank (Tr. 
107). She did not contact the bank; however, she expected KCCS to do so (Tr. 108). 
She did not know if KCCS had contacted the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.g, and she had not 
paid this debt (Tr. 108). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,238)—PAYMENT PLAN. This debt related to Applicant breaking 
a lease on an apartment (Tr. 82-83). An August 7, 2009, letter from the creditor states 
she now owes $2,143 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.h for a May 15, 2008, judgment, and 
she is accruing interest at the rate of 12% per month (AE D). According to her 
agreement with this creditor, the first monthly payment of $300 was due on August 17, 
2009, and $300 was due every 30 days thereafter until the debt was paid (AE D). She 
provided photocopies of three $300 money orders dated in August, September, and 
October 2009, and indicated these three payments made this debt current (Tr. 83-84; 
AE E, I). When she responded to the SOR, she denied this debt because she took 
exception to some of the charges, such as clean-up costs (Tr. 84-87).  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i to 1.v ($6,458)—10 DEBTS NOT SUBSTANTIATED, FOUR 
SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBTS. These 14 SOR debts all related to medical 
services Applicant allegedly received. Applicant said she always went to the same 
doctor (Tr. 67). She believed that if she owed her doctor money he would stop providing 
care for her (Tr. 67). She contended the 14 accounts should have been paid by her 
insurance company, or were not her responsibility (Tr. 48-53). She said she submitted 
the bills or invoices to her insurance company; however, the insurance company did not 
pay their portion of the bill (Tr. 53-54). Applicant intended to dispute all 14 medical debts 
(Tr. 69). Applicant provided a February 17, 2009, TransUnion report, which indicated 
two medical debts were still valid despite her disputes: SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($3,713) and 1.k 
($421) (AE B). After her hearing, Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian 
Credit Report which included the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n ($207) (AE O at 2) and 
1.q ($110).

 Applicant’s net monthly salary after deductions is $3,526 (Tr. 110-113; GE 3 at 
10; AE J, X). Her monthly expenses are about $2,356,8 leaving about $1,170 to address 
her delinquent debts (Tr. 113-122; GE 3 at 10). After deducting her monthly debt 
payment of $300 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.h, her approximate remainder is $870 (Tr. 
124). Applicant rents her current residence (Tr. 32). Her rent is current (Tr. 109-110). In 
July 2009, she purchased a 2007 Honda vehicle, and her monthly vehicle payment is 
$450 (Tr. 117). She provides about $150 monthly to her elderly parents (Tr. 119).  Her 
utilities are current (Tr. 123). 
 
 Applicant believed she would not have delinquent debts in the future because 
she is no longer traveling due to her employment and has the time to ensure her debts 
are paid or resolved (Tr. 131). Sometimes she did not pay disputed debts because she 
believed they were unjust (Tr. 131). She has not incurred any delinquent debt in the last 
three years (Tr. 151). She has not received credit counseling (Tr. 128). 
 
After her hearing, Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian Credit 
Report which included the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($5,732) (AE O at 2), and a non-SOR 
judgment filed on May 15, 2008, for $1,753 (AE O at 1).    
 
Character evidence 
 
On January 25, 2009, Applicant received a superb rating from her supervisor (AE 
G). On a scale of one to five with five being the best rating, she received fives in all 
areas (AE G). She is outstanding in the areas of quality of work, knowledge, 
dependability, ability to improve, organization, problem solving, customer service, 
interpersonal skills, and technical support skills (AE G). Her supervisor specifically 
noted her organizational skills and superb ability to maintain pleasant, interpersonal 
relationships (AE G).  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . .

loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance 
[or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 
2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. 
See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance [or 
trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 
484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.” Section 7 of 
Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” 
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the relevant trustworthiness concern is under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified [and sensitive] information. An individual who is 
financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and 
may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted, “Applicant’s 
credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR Case 
No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). The SOR listed 22 delinquent debts, 
totaling $18,872. Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her credit 
reports and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors were 
paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Her 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). As indicated previously, the SOR listed 
22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872. Despite some positive developments, Applicant’s 
unresolved, delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
Four of the fourteen medical SOR debts are established. On February 17, 2009, 
TransUnion reiterated that Applicant still owed the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($3,713) 
and 1.k ($421). Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian Credit Report which 
included the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n ($207) and 1.q ($110). There is insufficient 
evidence to establish the other 10 medical debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 
and 1.r to 1.v are owed.   
 
Applicant’s responsibility for four of the eight non-medical SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.h is established. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($98), 1.f ($329), and 1.g ($188) were not 
established. She denied knowledge of the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f, and although 
she had an account with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.g, she was unaware of the $188 debt. 
Applicant admitted she did not make any payments on seven of the eight non-medical 
SOR debts. However, Applicant has made sufficient progress paying or resolving one 
debt. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,238) relates to Applicant breaking a lease on an 
apartment. An August 7, 2009, letter from the creditor states she now owes $2,143. 
From August to October 2009, she paid $900 to the creditor.  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her financial problems 
were aggravated when she left employment and was briefly unemployed, and had to 
move to a different city to secure employment. Her 14 medical debts are another 
uncontrolled aspect of her financial situation.9 She does not receive full mitigating credit 
 
9“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
because she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to 
address her delinquent debts. She did not provide sufficient documentation about her 
finances to meet her burden and establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). 
   
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. 
Although she provided a personal financial statement and used a credit repair company 
to obtain changes to her credit reports, she could have benefited from financial 
counseling. She did not carefully monitor the credit repair company’s efforts on her 
behalf. After she learned that she had not successfully disputed debts, she did not take 
the next step to resolve the delinquent debt, that is, further investigation or negotiation 
of a payment plan. She seemed to have sufficient funds remaining after payment of her 
expenses and debts to begin payment plans with her SOR creditors. She did not show a 
sufficient track record of reducing and resolving her debts. There are not “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” She does not receive 
full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because she did not establish good faith10 in the 
resolution of the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.q.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the debts in 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.r to 1.v. Applicant hired 
a credit repair company to contest the information in her credit reports, and 
subsequently received some information that 10 medical debts were removed from her 
credit reports. Although there is minimal documentation supporting Applicant’s dispute 
of any debts, under all the circumstances, I will mitigate these 10 medical debts. 
Applicant had health insurance, and always sought medical care from the same 
provider. It is probable that her medical care provider failed to provide sufficient 
documentation to obtain payments from her insurance company, or her insurance 
company failed to adequately explain to her provider what is needed to perfect the 
provider’s claims. Removal of the medical debts from her credit reports is sufficient to 
show they were successfully disputed. However, the four medical debts currently listed 
on her credit reports (1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.j) are not adequately disputed.  
 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Some of Applicant’s non-medical, SOR debts do not appear on the two credit 
reports she provided. However, her credit repair company has disputed some of her 
debts because they were over seven years old, asserting the debt information was 
obsolete. Under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of 
limitations for collections cannot be mitigated solely because they are not collectable.11 
There is insufficient evidence to establish she was never responsible for the non-
medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.h.       
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her financial situation was adversely affected by 
her changing employment, needing to move to a different city, and medical debts. Some 
debts were not paid because she was traveling extensively for her employer. His SOR 
listed 22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872. Ten medical debts totaling $2,007 were 
sufficiently disputed and mitigated, and the SOR debt to ¶ 1.h ($1,238) was in a 
payment plan. Eight SOR debts for $15,012 were not mitigated. I am not confident she 
will pay these eight delinquent SOR debts because of her insufficient track record of 
financial progress on her SOR debts shown over the last three years.     
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance or assignment to a public trust position by 
considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The 
administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance or assignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense 
judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person 
concept. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole person 
 
11The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant’s legal responsibility to 
pay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of 
decisions the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, 
which is the law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 
20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). See also n. 10, supra.

analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance or assignment to a 
public trust position is insufficient at this time, there are several factors tending to 
support approval of her access to sensitive information. Applicant deserves substantial 
credit for volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a 
defense contractor. She provided a superb employee evaluation. There is no evidence 
that she has a criminal record or has ever violated security rules. There is every 
indication that she is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, her 
employer. She does not abuse alcohol or illegal drugs. She has never been fired from a 
job or left employment under adverse circumstances. Her file does not contain any 
adverse information relating to police involvement. Her changes in employment and 
medical treatment contributed to her financial woes. She paid $900 towards one of her 
SOR debts, and successfully disputed other adverse financial information. These 
factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole person factors against continuation of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information are more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve her just debts is 
not prudent or responsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. Some 
of her debts became delinquent more than five years ago. On September 18, 2008, she 
responded to DOHA interrogatories, and on July 20, 2009, she responded to the SOR. 
She had ample opportunity to contact her SOR creditors and to make greater progress 
in the resolution of her SOR debts. She did not pay, start payments, adequately dispute, 
or otherwise resolve eight of her SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 
1.q), which total $15,012. Although she made three, $300 payments to one SOR 
creditor, her personal financial statement indicates she had sufficient funds after 
expenses to address more of her delinquent SOR debts.   
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial circumstances. I take this 
position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 
(1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors” and supporting evidence, 
my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my 
interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to 
mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is 
not eligible to occupy a public trust position at this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant      
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:   For Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.l and 1.m:  For Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.n:   Against Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.o and 1.p:  For Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.q:   Against Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.r to 1.v:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
   
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.
