HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 18 delinquent debts, totaling 
$47,979. He is making payments to address one SOR debt through garnishment of his 
pay. He has not made any payments to any of his other SOR creditors. He intentionally 
falsified his 2007 security clearance application. Financial considerations and personal 
conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 20, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated

by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 10 and 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On August 
20, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On August 21, 2009, DOHA issued a 
hearing notice (GE 7). On August 27, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was held.1 At the 
hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-21), and 
Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 82-83; AE A-B). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 20-21), and AE A-B (Tr. 83). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of 
Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On September 3, 2009, I received 
the transcript.    
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, Applicant admitted he owed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a to 1.r (GE 9). He admitted he lied when he completed his December 20, 2007, SF-
86 (GE 9). He explained that he compromised his integrity because he needed to earn a 
living and pay his financial obligations (GE 9). He said he was slowly eliminating his 
overdue financial obligations and would continue to make them his priority (GE 9). His 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 63 years old, and he is seeking employment with a defense 
contractor (Tr. 6). He entered the United States from a South American country in 1969 
(Tr. 41). He joined the U.S. Army and served in Korea as a medic (Tr. 41). From 1971 to 
1974, he was on active duty (Tr. 41-42, 46). He received an honorable discharge from 
the Army (GE 1). In 1973, he became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 46). He completed one year of 
college (Tr. 6). From 1974 to 1996, he worked for the subway as a laborer and foreman 
(Tr. 42, 47). He recently held an interim Secret security clearance (Tr. 7).   
 
From 1996 to 2003, Applicant lived in a South American country (Tr. 42, 48). 
There were riots and rampant crime in the South American country, and Applicant 
decided to return to the United States (Tr. 42, 72-73). From June 2003 to April 2004, he 
returned to working on the subway (Tr. 49). From April 2004 to the present, he worked 
for a series of government contractors (Tr. 50, 75). On May 25, 2009, he lost his 
 
1At his hearing, Applicant waived his right to 15-days’ notice of the date, time, and location of his 
hearing (Tr. 15-16). 
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

employment because of his security clearance problem (Tr. 74-75).  For the last two 
years before he became unemployed, he earned about $30,000 to $32,000 per year 
(Tr. 75).   
 
In 2004, Applicant married a woman living in the South American country where 
he was born (Tr. 50). He was anxious to get his wife out of the South American country 
because of the criminal activity where she lived and the exceptional danger to her 
person (Tr. 45). In 2006, he was able to bring his spouse to the United States (Tr. 50). 
Applicant has three children and three stepchildren (Tr. 51). His children do not live with 
him; however, one of his stepchildren lives in his household (Tr. 51). His sick brother 
also stays with Applicant (Tr. 57, 59). Two of his stepchildren are still living in the South 
American country (Tr. 51). In total, Applicant provides support in his household for his 
spouse, one stepchild, and his sick brother.   
 
A court order required Applicant to pay for child support; however, he insisted he 
was not the child’s father (Tr. 52; SOR response).  He asked the judge to order a DNA 
test to establish paternity; however, he did not have the funds to pay for the DNA test 
because he was unemployed at that time (Tr. 52). Now that he has sufficient funds for 
the DNA test, he is unable to locate the child (Tr. 71). From February 2007 to February 
2008, the court garnished $100 a month from Applicant’s pay (Tr. 56). The judge 
declined to order the DNA test (Tr. 52). He currently owes about $10,000 in child 
support arrearage, and he pays $35 a month (Tr. 53, 55). 
   
Financial considerations 
 
The SOR listed 18 delinquent debts, totaling $47,979 as follows: 1.a ($161); 1.b 
($12,130); 1.c ($12,643); 1.d ($860); 1.e ($611); 1.f ($1,122); 1.g ($463); 1.h ($688); 1.i 
($1,325); 1.j ($738); 1.k ($12,924); 1.l ($705); 1.m ($860); 1.n ($946); 1.o ($518); 1.p 
($266); 1.q ($620); and 1.r ($399). 
 
In June of 2006, Applicant went to the South American country where he was 
born to bring his spouse to the United States (Tr. 63, 65). In July 2006, she moved to 
the United States (Tr. 66, 81). The trip cost about $5,000 (Tr. 80). Applicant’s spouse 
moved into his apartment, and he needed a larger apartment (Tr. 61).  His monthly rent 
went from about $750 to about $1,200 (Tr. 62). His utilities also increased (Tr. 62). She 
was underemployed until recently when she received a permanent green card (Tr. 64).  
 
In December 2006, the payroll checks from Applicant’s employer had a problem 
and Applicant’s bank account was overdrawn (Tr. 66). His checks bounced and he had 
to pay about ten returned-check fees (Tr. 66). A month later his check from his 
employer arrived; however, his employer did not reimburse him for his returned-check 
fees (Tr. 67). The total cost for the returned checks was $350 (Tr. 80).  
 
On February 25, 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant (GE 2). The OPM interview thoroughly discussed Applicant’s 
delinquent debts (GE 2). He promised to pay several of his SOR debts by December 
2008 (GE 2).

On April 5, 2009, he made one $260 payment to a debt consolidation company 
(Tr. 76; GE 2). He learned he could settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $5,000 and 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.p for $56 (Tr. 77). He did not make any payments to any SOR 
creditors, except for the monthly $35 payments on his child support arrearage (SOR ¶ 
1.k). He did not receive financial counseling (Tr. 77). 
 
Falsification of security clearance application (SF-86) 
 
On December 20, 2007, Applicant completed his SF-86 (Tr. 68; GE 1). The SOR 
alleges that in regard to his relevant financial history, his SF-86 asked two questions. 
Applicant responded “No” to subsections 27b and 27d (GE 1). Subsections 27b and 27d 
asked: 
 
Section 27: Your Financial Record 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
b. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any 
property repossessed for any reason? 
 
d. In the last seven years, have you had any judgments against you that 
have not been paid? 
 
Applicant’s SF-86 contains the following admonition: 
 
Certification That My Answers Are True 
 
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good 
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form 
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 
18, United States Code). 
 
(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition appears his signature 
(Tr. 68; GE 1). Applicant admitted that he signed and certified this SF-86 (Tr. 68).  
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SF-86, when he failed to disclose the 
judgment for overdue child support and the follow-on garnishment of his pay for the 
child support arrearage (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b; GE 1, 6).3 On February 25, 2008, 
Applicant admitted to an OPM investigator that he had $12,924 in delinquent child 
support and that his pay was being garnished as recently as October 2007 (GE 2). At 
 
3 A 1995 judgment for child support in the amount of $5,289 was included in the record (GE 6). It 
is unclear when the court ordered subsequent judgments. It is clear that Applicant’s pay was being 
garnished at the time he filled out his 2007 SF-86 for a child-support collection that totaled at that time for 
about $12,000 (SOR ¶ 1.k). In the findings, I will merge the judgment falsification allegation into the 
garnishment allegation and find For Applicant in SOR ¶ 2.b. See page 12, infra.

his hearing, Applicant admitted $100 per month of his pay was being garnished for the 
child support arrearage when he signed his SF-86 (Tr. 68). He explained that he did not 
answer his SF-86 truthfully because he thought he might not be hired if he was behind 
on paying child support (Tr. 69).  
 
Character evidence 
 
Applicant’s current supervisor was in charge of the department’s investigatory file 
system and a retired federal criminal investigator (Tr. 23-24, 31). He has known 
Applicant since December 2008, and he has daily contact with Applicant throughout the 
duty day (Tr. 25-26, 29). The investigatory files contain information at Secret and 
sensitive classification or protection levels (Tr. 26). Applicant was initially a temporary 
worker and later became permanently assigned by specific request because of his solid 
work performance (Tr. 25). Applicant is a very hard working, trustworthy, and reliable 
employee (Tr. 27, 32). He has a positive attitude, shows initiative, and is willing to arrive 
early and work late to complete tasks (Tr. 27-28). He is conscientious about security 
and safeguards sensitive information (Tr. 28). 
 
Applicant’s supervisor from April 2006 to April 2007 said Applicant was a laborer 
who set up conference rooms for meetings, moved furniture, and made repairs (Tr. 35-
36). She supervised his work on a daily basis (Tr. 37). She described him as very 
dependable, trustworthy, hard working, and responsible (Tr. 37-39). Applicant was often 
requested to take care of tasks because of his work ethic and positive attitude (Tr. 38).  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted, “Applicant’s 
credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR Case 
No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is 
also documented in his OPM interview, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR 
response, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were 
paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He has made insufficient progress paying 
or resolving 17 of his 18 SOR debts, which now total about $45,000. None of the SOR 
debts are paid or disputed. His delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted from underemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer’s 
late payment of one month’s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America 
to assist his spouse in moving to the United States, his costs to resettle her in the 
United States, and the expenses of moving into and maintaining a larger residence in 
the United States.4 He does not receive full mitigating credit because he did not 
establish that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address his delinquent 
debts. He did not provide sufficient documentation about his income and expenditures 
over the last two years to receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(b). 
   
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. 
Although he provided a personal financial statement and started a debt consolidation 
and repayment plan, he did not demonstrate a sufficiently firm grasp of budgeting, 
payment plans, and expense reduction. He did not show any reduction in his expenses 
even though he learned about the security significance of his delinquent debts during 
his OPM interview on February 25, 2008. He has not demonstrated the financial self-
discipline necessary to reduce and resolve his debts. There are not “clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He does not receive full 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he did not establish good faith5 in the resolution of 
his SOR debts.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because of the lack of documentation supporting 
Applicant’s dispute of any debts. However, under all the circumstances, I did mitigate 
his child support debt (SOR ¶ 1.k) because he is making payments and attempted to 
dispute this debt by requesting a DNA test.   
 
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His debts initially resulted from 
underemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer’s late payment of one 
month’s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America to assist his spouse 
in moving to the United States, and the costs to set up a family household in the United 
States. His SOR listed 18 debts and about $45,000 is owed to his creditors. I am not 
confident he will keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts because of his insufficient 
track record of financial progress shown over the last two years.     
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security 
clearance application: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On December 20, 2007, Applicant completed his SF-86, which asked, “[i]n the 
last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished .  .  .  for any reason?” Applicant 
falsely responded “No” to this question. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) both apply because he 
provided a false answer about his pay being garnished. Further review is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of

authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
   
Applicant credibly stated he intentionally falsified his SF-86 with the intent to 
deceive the government about the garnishment of his pay for child support.6 Applicant 
thought he would not be hired if he accurately disclosed this information. He receives 
partial credit for admitting on February 25, 2008, to an OPM investigator that he had 
$12,924 in delinquent child support, and his pay was being garnished as recently as 
October 2007. He also admitted in his SOR response and at his hearing that he 
 
6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

2004)). “When an applicant claims that a false answer to a [SF-86] question is not deliberate, the Judge 
should address explicitly any contrary evidence in the record.” ISCR Case No. 08-07998 at 2 (App. Bd.

deliberately provided false information on his SF-86 to deceive the government about 
his financial situation. He was candid and forthright at his hearing about his financial 
problems. I conclude, however, that his honesty to the OPM investigator and thereafter 
about falsifying his SF-86 is not sufficient to mitigate the falsification of his SF-86 itself.     
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
    
The whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant’s security 
clearance at this time. Applicant’s supervisors noted Applicant’s excellent work 
performance. He is a diligent, hard working, and dedicated employee. He was candid 
and forthright about falsifying his SF-86 to obtain employment. I do not believe he would 
falsify a future SF-86. His financial problems initially resulted because of 
underemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer’s late payment of one 
month’s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America to assist his spouse 
in moving to the United States, and costs to resettle her in the United States. Now that 
the government is well-aware of his financial problems and falsification of his SF-86, his 
motive to conceal these particular acts of misconduct and vulnerability to exploitation, 
manipulation, and duress have been eliminated. Applicant is a capable, reliable, and 
dedicated employee.   
 
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial.  
Applicant submitted a false SF-86 in December 2007. He has 17 delinquent SOR debts 
totaling about $45,000. He did not take action to use a debt consolidation plan until 
March of 2009, and he made his first and only $260 payment into the plan in April of 
2009. The only payment actually made to his creditors resulted from garnishment of his 
pay for a child support arrearage. His efforts to address his delinquent debts for the last 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
two years have been inadequate, and financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated at this time. His misconduct concerning falsification of his SF-86 cannot be 
mitigated because the falsification was knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He 
was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Falsification of a security 
clearance application shows a lack of trustworthiness and poor judgment. Such conduct 
goes to the heart of the clearance process, and a security clearance is not warranted at 
this time.     
  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors,”7 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.k:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.l to 1.r:  Against Applicant 
 
PARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
