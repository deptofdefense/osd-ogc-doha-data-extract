RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
On May 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective 
within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 30, 2009, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 29, 2009. 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled on September 22, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
 
1

27. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered 
Exhibits (AE) A through N, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2009.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 The Government withdrew the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.n 
and 1.p. The remaining allegations were renumbered and the change was made on the 
SOR to reflect allegations 1.a through 1.l.1 There were no objections. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f, 1.i, 1.k and denied 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.j and 1.l. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 45 years old and has worked for a federal agency as a civilian 
government employee since December 1987. He also works part-time as a security 
officer for a federal contractor. He has worked for different companies in the same 
capacity since 1992. He stated he holds a security clearance for his federal 
employment, but his part-time employer required him to update his security clearance 
application for employment.2  
 
 Applicant served in the Marines from 1983 to 1987, and was honorably 
discharged. He married in 1990, and has a daughter who is 18 years old. He divorced in 
2000. He was separated from his wife when he had a child in 1995, with a different 
woman. He stated he pays child support for this child, but not through a court order. At 
present he pays $150 a month, but in the past he has paid $300 a month, depending on 
his income. He married a different woman in 2002. He is still married, but he and his 
wife separated in 2007. He has no children with his wife.3  
 
 In 2000, after reading a book, Applicant made a decision that he would not file or 
pay his federal or state income taxes. The author of the book explained why taxes were 
unconstitutional and advised the reader to file an exemption form with the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant asked his friend who is a tax advisor about the 
validity of the author’s premise. He was advised by the tax advisor that the premise of 
the book was “fiction” and he needed to pay his taxes. Applicant made a conscious 
decision to have no money withheld from his pay for taxes, not to file the proper federal 
tax form, and not to pay his federal income taxes. He failed to file or pay his federal 
1 SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e remain the same. SOR allegation ¶ 1.k is changed to 1.f; SOR ¶1.l is 
changed to 1.g; SOR ¶1.o is changed to 1.h; SOR ¶1.q is changed to 1.i; SOR ¶1.r is changed to 1.j; 
SOR ¶1.s is changed to 1.k, and SOR ¶1.t is changed to 1.l.

income taxes from 2000 to 2006. He explained he used the money to buy things he 
wanted. He paid $15,000 in cash to purchase a foreclosed home that needed repairs. 
He spent $30,000 to repair the home. He stated he did it because of “greed” and knew it 
was wrong, but decided to continue because the IRS was not paying attention and did 
not pursue him. He continued to send the IRS an affidavit stating he was exempt from 
paying federal income taxes. He contradicted himself during his hearing, claiming later 
that he believed the affidavit was legitimate and he did not have to pay taxes. I did not 
find his testimony credible. The IRS eventually began garnishing his federal wages. 
Applicant stated there was a “major crackdown on frivolous filers.”4 
 
During this same period, Applicant also did not file or pay his state taxes or the 
property taxes on his house. He stated he also talked his wife into not filing her taxes. 
Applicant stated he was embarrassed that an Office of Personnel Management 
investigator interviewed him at his primary place of federal employment and considered 
it improper.5  
 
In 2006, Applicant stated he went to the IRS because his wages were being 
garnished, and he attempted to resolve his tax issues. He believed 15% of his wages 
were garnished, but did not provide any supporting documentation. He stated the IRS 
stopped garnishing his wages at one point because he was working reduced hours at 
the federal agency and was not earning enough income. In July 2009, the IRS began 
garnishing his wages from his second job. Applicant offered no documented proof that 
his wages were or are being garnished. He provided pay stubs from both employers for 
February 2009, but could not show a deduction for tax garnishment. He stated that in 
2006, he filed his overdue tax forms.6  
 
Applicant explained he negotiated a payment plan with the IRS and was to pay 
$500 a month beginning in February 2009. He made one payment in February 2009, 
and then missed March, April, May, and June 2009 payments. He stated he then sent 
documents to the IRS in July 2009, whereby they were to begin deducting $1,100 a 
month from his pay. He stated he made three payments. He provided no documentation 
that this occurred or that he has been making any payments.7 
 
Applicant has state tax liens against him for failing to file and pay his state taxes 
(SOR ¶ 1.c, $1,380) for 1999, 2000 and 2001. He stated he did not file for these years 
because he was going to get a refund and he had income withheld from his pay. I did 
not find his testimony credible.8

Applicant has a federal tax lien for 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.d, $22,165).9 There is also a 
tax lien for 2003 ($28,000) that is not alleged and he disputes the amount.10 He stated 
he is paying through garnishment the tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.b ($65,040) for tax years 
2004, 2005 and 2006. No documentary evidence was provided.11  
 
 Applicant stated that in 2006, he changed his withholding tax on his pay. He did 
not provide evidence that he took this action. Even if he did have money withheld, he 
still owed taxes for that year (SOR ¶ 1.a, $11,588).12 He admitted he was aware that not 
enough tax was being withheld, but did not change his withholdings for 2007. He stated 
he filed his 2007 tax return on time, but failed to sign the forms. He did not file his 2008 
income tax return on time. He again failed to sign his 2008 form. He eventually signed 
both 2007 and 2008 tax return forms, at the same time. It is unclear why he waited to 
sign his 2007 form until he signed his 2008 form.13  
 
 Applicant admitted he did not pay his property taxes. Judgments were entered 
against him by the city (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g, $4,563 and $3,422, from tax years 2001 
and 1999, respectively).14 Applicant offered an incomplete document to show a 
payment plan for his property taxes. The plan called for him to pay $384 a month 
beginning in November 2008. He stated he made three or four payments of $200. He 
explained that he would not pay his property taxes until the city threatened to take the 
property. When that would happen, he would pay a certain amount so they would cease 
their action. Once the city ceased its action, he would not pay until it threatened again. 
He did this on more than one occasion. Applicant provided no proof of payments to the 
city for his property taxes. He stated he withdrew $15,000 from his retirement account to 
make the payments. He had to pay a tax penalty for the withdrawal, along with paying 
the tax on the income. This increased his 2008 tax bill to approximately $16,000. It 
remains unpaid. He explained he used the money from his retirement account to pay 
other debts. Applicant admitted that he also used $2,000 from his retirement withdrawal 
to take his daughters on a vacation cruise. He has not paid his property taxes.15

Applicant did not pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i for phone services ($1,622).16 
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($644) and i.l ($30) are credit card debts to the same 
credit card company for different accounts. Applicant provided a document to show a 
debt to the same named creditor was paid.17 However he admitted he had more than 
one credit card with the same creditor. The document does not verify the account. The 
debts alleged have different account numbers listed. He did not provide proof that the 
debt paid is the same as the debts alleged.18  
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($13,000) is for the deficiency on a loan on a vehicle that 
was stolen. He stated he made arrangements with the creditor to pay one half of the 
debt. He stated he has $100 a month taken automatically from his credit union account 
to pay the debt. He stated he has been paying this debt for two years. He provided a 
document to show he was setting up an automatic withdrawal beginning sometime in 
January 2009. It does not state the amount. He did not provide proof that he has been 
making payments for two years or since January 2009.19 
 
Applicant disputes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($91) for a civil judgment for contempt 
of court. He stated he paid the debt and would not have been issued a hand gun permit 
had he not. He did not provide proof of payment.20 
 
Applicant stated in 2008 he had approximately $7,000 to $8,000 in savings from 
working two jobs. He did not use this money to pay his back taxes. He stated he paid off 
a credit card that was not alleged in the SOR.21  
 
Applicant believes he owes the IRS approximately $185,254 for past tax years 
and $16,000 for tax year 2008. He stated the IRS has advised him he owes $220,000. 
 
Applicant purchased a time share at a resort in 2005. He paid $200 a month and 
sold it back to the owner. He stated that in 2007, he and his wife would go to a resort 
city for entertainment three times a month during that year. He estimated the cost of the 
monthly trips was $600.22

Applicant owes more than $200,000 in federal income taxes. He owes 
approximately $1,380 in state incomes taxes. He owes more than $10,000 in property 
taxes. He stated he has payment plans. He did not provide proof he is paying any of 
these debts. I did not find Applicant’s testimony credible.23 
 
I have considered the certificates of completion of training Applicant submitted.24 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
23 Tr. 127-129. 
 
24 AE M. 
 
7 
 
 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, 
filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches 
of trust. 
 
Appellant has a significant history of not meeting his financial obligations. He 
intentionally did not file or pay his federal, state, and property taxes for many years. He 
has numerous tax liens and consumer debts that are not paid. I find there is sufficient 
evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating 
conditions under AG ¶ 20: 
 
 
8 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain 
unpaid. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant knowingly failed to file 
and evaded paying his taxes for many years. He asked a tax advisor if the information 
from the book he read was accurate and he was specifically told “no” and that he must 
pay his taxes. He chose to ignore the advice. He knew what he was doing was wrong 
and continued his conduct for years. He has been in contact with the IRS. He also has 
been in contact with state authorities. He has taken loans from his retirement account, 
but used the money to pay other debts and to take his daughters on a vacation cruise. 
He would also take his wife to a resort city several times a month for entertainment. 
Applicant disputes the amounts he owes to the IRS. He also disputes other debts. 
Applicant claims to have payment plans with the IRS and for his state taxes. However, 
he has failed to make the payments he promised. He failed to pay his property taxes 
until the city threatened foreclosure. Applicant failed to provide credible evidence that he 
paid any of the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. He failed to provide a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of his past-due debts and to provide documented proof to 
substantiate his dispute. I find none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
9 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country as a 
Marine and was honorably discharged. He made an intentional and deliberate decision 
to evade paying his taxes even though he knew it was wrong. He continued to evade 
paying his federal, state, and property taxes for years. Applicant has done very little to 
resolve his tax issues. Even when provided with a payment plan, he failed to make 
consistent payments and instead used some of his money for a vacation. Applicant’s 
actions show consistently poor judgment and untrustworthy conduct. His testimony 
lacked candor and credibility. His conduct was extensive, serious, and repetitive, 
spanning many years and included not only federal income taxes, but also state income 
taxes, and local property taxes. Even when offered the opportunity to begin a payment 
plan, he failed to follow through. In addition to his tax debts, he has other consumer 
debts that are also unpaid. Applicant has not changed his behavior. His motivation was 
greed. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline 
for Financial Considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:   Against Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
