HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has 12 unpaid accounts placed for collection, totaling in excess of 
$38,000. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. On November 14, 2008, acting under the 
relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial 
problems as evidenced by 15 accounts that had been placed for collection.  
  
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
1  
 On December 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. 
On March 10, 2009, I was assigned the case. On March 26, 2009, DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on April 22, 2009. The government offered 
Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his 
own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, which were admitted into evidence.  
 
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. On 
April 24, 2009 and May 1, 2009, additional documents were received. There being no 
objection, the material was admitted into evidence as Ex. D and Ex. E. On April 30, 
2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.l 
and 1.n. He admitted the remaining debts. Applicant’s admissions to the SOR 
allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old senior operational test evaluator who has worked for a 
defense contractor since November 2007, and is seeking to maintain a security 
clearance. His acquaintances state Applicant is efficient, competent, honest, dedicated, 
has great integrity, and demonstrates empathy and compassion. (Ex. D, E) 
 
 From March 1981 through December 1992, Applicant served on active duty in 
the U.S. Marine Corps. From January 1993 through November 2002 and March 2004 
through January 2005, Applicant served in the Army National Guard. From January 
2005 through November 2006, he served on active duty with the Army National Guard 
in Afghanistan. While in the service, he held a secret security clearance.  
 
 Applicant stated he started attending higher education in 1990. (Tr. 33) In 1998, 
he achieved his Bachelor of Arts degree in religion and in May 2002, he received a 
master’s degree in religion. (Tr. 33) Applicant obtained student loans to pay for his 
education. Student loans are listed in SOR ¶ 1.i ($52,360) and SOR ¶ 1.j ($26,337). In 
his response to the SOR, Applicant denied these two debts. Applicant’s May 2008 CBR 
and September 2008 CBR reflect numerous student loans obtained between July 1997 
and September 2003. (Ex. 2, 3) His student loans were to be deferred while he was on 
active duty.  
 
Applicant also has private student loans which are currently in deferral until 
February 2010. (Ex. C, Tr. 33) Applicant’s May 2008 CBR lists the amount in excess of 
$20,000. (Ex. 3) Applicant’s September 2008 CBR lists the amount in excess of 
$101,000. (Ex. 2) Applicant currently pays $438 monthly on his student loans. As of 
November 2008, Applicant owed the Department of Education approximately $98,000. 
(Ex. C)  
 
 Applicant was married from 1981 until 1990, and from December 1998 until May 
2002. (Tr. 36, Ex. 1) The day following his May 2002 graduation, his divorce became 
2  
final. (Tr. 25, 27) From the end of May 2002 through January 2003, Applicant was 
homeless. (Tr. 25) The little money he was getting from his military reserve pay went to 
paying his child support. (Tr. 26) Applicant provided no information as to his 
unemployment or as to why he was homeless.  
 
In 2003, he moved from California to live with his daughter in Texas. (Tr. 27) He 
found employment as a substitute teacher and part-time as a security guard. (Tr. 28) 
When his rent increased from $650 to $1,000 per month, he left the apartment. (Tr. 32, 
39) He does not know why the amount he yet owes is so large. (Tr. 40) He was not 
behind on his rent when he notified the apartment complex he was leaving. After he left, 
the creditor placed an $8,975 (SOR ¶ 1.c) account for collection. Eight months 
remained on his one-year lease. (Tr. 51) Applicant admitted he owed this debt, in his 
response to the SOR. 
 
In February 2005, Applicant was called to active duty for 18 months. (Tr. 28) In 
November 2006, having been diagnosed with cancer, Applicant was medically 
discharged at the rank of E-5. Applicant receives $1,200 in military retirement and a 
$200 payment from the Veteran’s Administration (VA) having received a VA disability 
rating of 20%. (Tr. 29, 36) In July 2009, he intents to go to court to argue for full 
retirement and an increase in his VA disability rating. (Tr. 29)  
 
 Applicant’s retirement and unemployment compensation he was to receive after 
leaving active duty was intercepted and sent to his ex-wife for child support. (Tr. 30) 
Applicant pays his ex-wife $550 per month child support. Applicant’s September 2008 
credit bureau report (CBR) lists a balance of $52,126. Applicant’s children, now ages 
24, 26, and 28, are from his first marriage. Applicant incurred the child support 
obligation when the children were minors and he was unable to make his payments.  
 
In July 2007, Applicant obtained his current job. (Tr. 30) He was laid off from 
work for two weeks in 2007, for a month in 2008, and more than a week in 2009. (Tr. 
38, 44) His weekly take-home pay from his civilian job is $700. (Tr. 44) His $550 
monthly child support payment is automatically deducted from his pay. (Tr. 46) After 
child support and taxes he receives $243 from the VA and $900 from the military. (Tr. 
47) He pays $300 rent per month, $150 per month for groceries, $100 per month for his 
cell phone, $180 gasoline expense per month, $82 monthly auto insurance, $200 
miscellaneous monthly expenses, and $800 monthly car payment on his car and his 
daughter’s car. Both his and his daughter’s cars are 2004 models and both were 
purchased used. (Tr. 46, 47, 49) As previously stated, he pays $438 monthly on his 
student loan obligation.  
 
Applicant has $300 in savings and $1,000 in a 401(k) retirement plan. He does 
not have any credit cards. (Tr. 47, 48) His health insurance is paid by the military until 
July 2009. Prior to 2003, he received some financial counseling. (Tr. 48) Applicant is not 
currently being contacted by creditors concerning past due debt. Applicant hopes to 
obtain overseas employment paying more than his current job. (Tr. 54)  
 
3  
During a June 2008 or July 2008 interview, Applicant’s debts were discussed 
using a copy of his CBR. (Tr. 56)  A summary of Applicant’s debts follows:

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
5  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns 
relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed-
upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk 
that is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 The record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. Applicant has 12 accounts placed for collection which total in excess of 
$38,000. Seven of Applicant’s debts were under $500 each, and together totaled 
approximately $1,800. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts” and AG ¶19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply.  
 
6  
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a) – (e) are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 The largest debts Applicant owes are his student loans and child support 
obligation. He is making $438 monthly payments on approximately $98,000 of student 
loans with the Department of Education. ($34) The student loans owed a private lender 
are deferred until February 2010. He was interviewed about his debts in June or July 
2008. Since that date, he has paid a $54 cable bill. Even though six additional debts are 
under $500 each, he has paid only this one small debt since receiving the November 
2008 SOR.  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has numerous accounts placed for 
collection, which remain unpaid. They are relatively recent having occurred following his 
2002 divorce. The debts are the types that are likely to recur and his failure to address 
them does cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
 
AG & 20(b) applies because Applicant experienced divorce, loss of employment, 
was homeless for seven months ending in January 2003, and currently suffers from 
cancer. Until July 2009, his medical insurance will be paid by the military. Applicant=s 
financial problems were contributed to by divorce and child support obligations. 
However, since obtaining his current job in April 2007, he has been unemployed for less 
than two-months in that two-year period, and has only been able to pay one small debt. 
 
 Prior to 2003, Applicant did receive some financial counseling. Currently, 
creditors are not contacting him. However, there are no clear indications that the 
7  
problem is being resolved or is under control because more than $38,000 in 12 
accounts remains unpaid. AG & 20(c) does not apply. 
 
As of September 2008, the balance of his child support obligation was $52,126. 
His child support obligation is not a debt of concern listed in the SOR.  However, how he 
meets this obligation offers insight as to how Applicant addresses his financial 
obligations. His $550 monthly child support payments are automatically deducted from 
his pay. Applicant is paying part of his student loan obligation and his other student 
loans are deferred until February 2010. His payment of these obligations reflects a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG & 20(d) 
applies to his student loans obligation and child support obligation.  
 
AG & 20(e) does not apply because Applicant is not disputing the legitimacy of 
the past-due debts. In his response to the SOR, the only debts he initially denied were 
his student loans and two other debts totaling $110. At the hearing, Applicant stated 
there were some debts he was uncertain about and did not know why two of the debts 
were so large, but he provided no proof to substantiate he had disputed these debts.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred a large student 
loan obligation obtaining his bachelor’s and master’s degrees, but is addressing those 
obligations. In 2002, he suffered the unfortunate events of both a divorce and being 
homeless. Additionally, he was unemployed for periods of time.  
 
 The likelihood Applicant will address the unpaid accounts is based, in part, on 
what he has done since learning of the government’s concern regarding his finances. 
During the summer of 2008, he was interviewed about his finances and past due 
8  
9  
obligations. In November 2008, the SOR was issued. Other than his child support and 
student loan payments, in the five months following the SOR, he paid only a single debt 
of less than $100. Other relatively small obligations remain unpaid. Two of the unpaid 
accounts placed for collection were under $100 each. Seven of Applicant’s debts were 
under $500 each. Applicant has done little to address his financial problems. He has 
failed to mitigate or rebut the financial considerations security concern. 
 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot 
or will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award 
of a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime 
occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to 
the evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not 
recommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a 
security clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established 
compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well 
demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at 
this time is not warranted.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, financial considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.h:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  For Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.k – 1. m:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o:   Against Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
