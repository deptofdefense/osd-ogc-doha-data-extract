HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has 21 accounts that have been placed for collection, which total in 
excess of $23,000. She has paid none of the debts. Applicant has failed to rebut or 
mitigate the government’s security concerns under financial considerations. Clearance 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke her 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order 
and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 23, 2008, detailing security concerns under 
financial considerations. 
  
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
 
 
  
 The SOR lists 20 debts totaling in excess of $23,000. In her answer to the SOR, 
which was received on received November 6, 2008, Applicant requested a hearing. On 
March 10, 2009, I was assigned the case. On March 26, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing scheduling the hearing held on April 22, 2009. The government offered Exhibits 
(Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own 
behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were admitted into evidence. On April 
30, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR lists 21 debts totaling in excess of $23,000 as having been placed for 
collection. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the debts listed in SOR ¶ 1.a, 
1.g, 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p and 1.s. She denies the remaining debts. In her answer to the 
SOR, Applicant admits owing eight of the debts totaling approximately $4,500 and 
denies owing 13 debts totaling in excess of $19,000. Applicant’s admissions to the SOR 
allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 33-year-old logistician who has worked for a defense contractor 
since February 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In 1996, Applicant 
divorced. She has no children.  
 
 When living with her finance, Applicant worked as a babysitter. (Tr. 19) She was 
able to pay her credit cards from her job as a babysitter. Following a fight with her 
finance, Applicant left the country. From December 2003 to February 2006, Applicant 
lived in Puerto Rico. (Ex. 1, Tr. 30) After moving there she did not pay attention to her 
credit, made no payments on any of her debts, and did not inform her creditors of her 
new location. (Tr. 19) At the time, she had 19 credit cards. (Tr. 31) She hired an 
individual and paid him a couple of dollars to fix her credit. (Tr. 19) Positive results were 
not received.  
 
 On September 3, 2008, Applicant entered into an agreement with a credit 
consultant in a credit restoration process. (Ex. C) She paid a $750 fee. (Tr. 27) As of 
September 2008, Applicant’s credit scores were 572, 554, and 532. (Ex. D) As of 
November 2008, her credit scores had improved to 678, 640, and 640. (Ex. E)  
 
 In December 2008, she purchased a house for $97,000 on which her monthly 
mortgage payments are $980. (Tr. 25) Since purchasing her home, she is paying her 
current bills including utilities, but has made no payment on her older debts. (Tr. 20) 
She is current on her mortgage and two credit cards, one a department store account 
with a $400 limit and a MasterCard with a $300 limit. (Tr. 25, 26)  
 
 Applicant is paid $25 per hour. (Tr. 28) Her take home pay is $2,600. (Tr. 38) Her 
monthly expenses include: utilities ($200-$300), cell phone ($100), car payment ($320), 
groceries ($200), gasoline ($200), and miscellaneous ($300 - $400). Her monthly net 
remainder (take home pay less monthly expenses) is between $80 and $280. She has 
$100 in savings. She had not attended financial counseling. (Tr. 41)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
 
 
 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Revised Adjudicative (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
 
 
 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed 
upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk 
that is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. 
 
 The record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. Applicant has 21 accounts placed for collection totaling in excess of $23,000. 
Ten of Applicant’s debts were under $250 each. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG ¶19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a) – (e) are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 In December 2003 Applicant moved to Puerto Rico. After moving there she did 
not pay attention to her credit, made no payments on any of her debts, and did not 
inform her creditors of her new location. At the time, she had 19 credit cards in addition 
to unpaid utility bills. She has paid none of her debts. She hired a credit consultant to 
help restore her credit. Her credit scores improved from 572, 554, and 532 in 
September 2008 to 678, 640, and 640 in November 2008. Six of the SOR debts were 
deleted from Applicant’s November 2008 CBR. (Ex. F) However, Applicant admitted in 
her answer to the SOR owing five of the deleted debts: (SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($1,271), 1.h 
 
 
 
($1,271), 1.l ($479), 1.m ($244), and 1.n. ($485) In December 2008, her credit allowed 
her to purchase a home.  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. Applicant had 19 credit card accounts when she left 
the country in 2003. She has not paid any of her debts. The behavior is recent and the 
accounts numerous. There is nothing in the record supporting her behavior is unlikely to 
recur except that she has purchased a home and her current mortgage payment, utility 
payments, and two credit cards are current. Leaving the country and not paying her bills 
does cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
AG & 20(b) does not apply. Her financial problems were not caused by factors 
beyond her control and she has not acted responsibility under the circumstances. Hiring 
a consultant to restore her credit is not the same as paying her past due obligations.  
 
AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. Applicant has paid none of the debts listed 
in the SOR even though ten of them are under $250 each. She has not attended 
financial classes. 
 
AG & 20(e) does not apply. Applicant asserts she did not have service with a few 
of the creditors. But she has contacted none of the creditors to challenge the debts. AG 
& 20(e) requires documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue, which Applicant failed to provide.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred numerous credit 
card obligations and then failed to pay them when she left the country. She’s been 
employed in her current job since February 2008 and has made no payments on her 
accounts placed for collection.  
 
 
 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, financial considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a – 1.u:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
