HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 13 debts totaling about $36,000. 
She paid seven debts, totaling about $4,800. She successfully disputed a debt for $370. 
The five remaining debts are in established payment plans. Applicant did not 
intentionally fail to disclose her financial problems on her security clearance application. 
Applicant mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 29, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 5), pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated

by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On February 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 6). On April 14, 
2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On April 16, 2009, DOHA 
assigned the case to me. On April 17, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 6). At 
the hearing held on May 21, 2009, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GE 1-3) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and Applicant offered 12 exhibits (Tr. 20-24; AE A-L). 
Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of AE A-L, and I admitted them 
(Tr. 23-24). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, response to the SOR, 
and an e-mail keeping the record open until July 10, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit 
additional evidence (GE 4-7). I received the transcript on May 29, 2009. On May 27, 
2009, I received nine post-hearing exhibits, and on July 9, 2009, I received 24 post-
hearing exhibits. These 33 exhibits were admitted without objection as AE M-AS.    
   
Findings of Fact1 
 
In her SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a, 1.h, 1.l, and 1.m with explanations. She also admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a 
and 2.b with explanations (GE 6). She denied the other SOR allegations with 
explanations (GE 6). Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). For the last 
six years, she has been employed as a computer operator (Tr. 25). She has held a 
Secret security clearance for the last ten years (Tr. 9). She received her high school 
diploma in 1996 (Tr. 7). She married in June 2000 (Tr. 24). She has two children ages 
eight and five (Tr. 25). She separated from her husband in July 2006 (Tr. 24). She and 
her husband worked for the same employer, and he failed to pay an employer-issued 
credit card (Tr. 60). After her husband left employment with the company, the company 
took the $4,076 balance out of her pay over the next two years (Tr. 60-61). The 
company noted that they lived in a community property state, and debts incurred during 
marriage are joint debts of both the husband and wife (Tr. 61). On November 14, 2008, 
the $4,076 debt to her employer was paid in full (AE P). 
 
Applicant served on active duty in the Army for 2 ½ years (Tr. 8). She became 
pregnant, and she and her husband agreed she should leave active duty (Tr. 8). She 
received an honorable discharge (Tr. 8). She has an associate’s degree in management

(Tr. 7). She expects to earn her bachelor’s degree in management/computer systems in 
a year (Tr. 7).      
 
Financial Considerations 
    
Applicant’s SOR did not describe any bankruptcy filings. However, it listed 13 
delinquent debts, which are fully discussed in the next 13 paragraphs. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a ($1,000 owed to her child’s private school)—Payment Plan. 
Applicant’s husband was supposed to pay this debt (Tr. 27). It became delinquent 
between January 2008 and May 7, 2009 (Tr. 28). The creditor did not inform her the 
account was delinquent for quite a long time because she was friends with the school’s 
management (Tr. 27-29). She set up a payment arrangement and paid: $50 on June 6, 
2009; $680 on June 26, 2009; and $50 on July 1, 2009 (Tr. 29; AE A; AE E; AE F; AE 
W at 1).  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c ($42 and $44 owed to a pizza company)—Paid. In 2002 
using Applicant’s account, her husband wrote checks that were dishonored (Tr. 29-30). 
At the time she responded to the SOR, she was unaware of these two debts (Tr. 31). 
On April 20, 2009, she paid $175 resolving the debt (Tr. 30; AE I).  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d ($5,500 owed a collection company for a home security system)—
Dispute/Payment Plan. Applicant disputes this debt (Tr. 31). In 2006, a security 
company started billing her even though the company never installed the security 
system (Tr. 31-33). This was a joint debt with her husband (Tr. 32). On April 30, 2009, 
she entered into a payment plan with the creditor and made her first payment of $300 
(Tr. 32; AE K; AE Z). She also made $300 payments on June 2, 2009 and July 1, 2009 
(AE AA). She hopes to be reimbursed after the dispute filed in May 2009 is resolved (Tr. 
32-33).    
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e ($370 owed to a collection company)—Disputed. On April 20, 2009, 
Applicant contacted the collection company and learned the debt was transferred to 
another company (Tr. 35). She thought her husband may have incurred the debt 
because she had no knowledge of it (Tr. 35). The collection company promised to take 
action to have the debt removed from her credit report (Tr. 36; AE W at 2).   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,088 owed to a collection company based on a credit card debt)—
Paid. Prior to 2009, Applicant was not aware of this debt (Tr. 36-37). She had a credit 
card with this same company and it was current (Tr. 36). She learned the debt was from 
a previous, joint credit card issued prior to 2006 (Tr. 37). She paid $25 on April 20, 
2009, $250 payment on May 18, 2009, and the final $250 on June 24, 2009 (Tr. 37-38; 
AE J; AE R; AE U; AE AE; AE AF; AE AG).  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g ($1,837 owed to a collection company)—Paid. Prior to 2009, 
Applicant was not aware of this debt (Tr. 39). She thought her husband may have 
written the checks that generated this debt (Tr. 40). On April 20, 2009, she asked the 
collection company for documentation to show she owed this debt (Tr. 39). On June 30, 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
2009, she agreed to settle this debt for $918, and then she paid the settlement amount 
(AE W at 1; AE AO, AP).  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,117 owed to a collection company)—Paid. Applicant first learned 
of this debt in 2009 (Tr. 41). On April 30, 2009, she spoke to the creditor and agreed to 
and did pay $335 (Tr. 41; AE L). She also agreed to pay $50 a month starting May 30, 
2009 (Tr. 41-42; AE T; AE L). On June 24, 2009, the creditor indicated the amount 
owed was $698 and offered to settle the debt for $454 (AE AK). On July 1, 2009, she 
paid $454, resolving this debt (AE AN).     
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i ($395 owed on a cable debt)—Paid. The debt originated in 2005 (Tr. 
43). Applicant was not aware of it until 2009 (Tr. 43). After she received the SOR, she 
paid it (Tr. 43-44; AE B).   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j ($360 owed to a collection company)—Paid. Applicant’s husband was 
responsible for this debt (Tr. 45-46). On May 14, 2009, she paid $479 and thought the 
debt was resolved (Tr. 47). However, the creditor wanted an additional $100 (Tr. 47-48).  
On May 29, 2009, she paid the remaining $100 (AE X).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.k ($744 owed to an insurance company)—Payment Plan. This is an old 
automobile insurance debt (Tr. 48-49). Applicant paid $62 on May 11, 2009 (Tr. 49; AE 
C; AE W at 1; AE S). On July 1, 2009, she paid $196 (AE W at 1; AE AI, AE AJ). She 
expects this debt to be paid in full in October 2009 (AE W at 1). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l ($3,818 owed to a collection company for a credit card)—Payment 
Plan. Applicant was making minimal payments on this account (Tr. 50, 52). Although 
this credit card was in Applicant’s name alone, she and her husband both used this 
credit card to purchase items (Tr. 51-52). The account probably became delinquent 
when she was going through marital problems and the initial separation (Tr. 51-53). 
However, she was surprised to discover the creditor was reporting the account as 
delinquent because she believed she was paying enough to keep the account current 
(Tr. 50, 52). She obtained a credit report in 2008, and it did not show the account as 
delinquent (Tr. 50-51). On May 29, 2009, she made a payment arrangement with the 
creditor and paid $75 on May 29, 2009, and $75 on June 29, 2009 (Tr. 55; AE W at 1; 
AE AB, AE AC; AE AD). The current balance is $4,174 (AE AC). The last three 
payments of $1,000 monthly will be in August, September and October (Tr. 55-56). The 
debt will be paid off completely in October 2009 (Tr. 55).   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m ($19,868 owed to a collection company for a repossessed BMW)—
Payment Plan. Applicant obtained a credit report in 2008, and it did not show the 
repossession of the BMW (Tr. 51). The vehicle debt was her husband’s responsibility 
(Tr. 51). She was making the $1,000 monthly payments from 2005 to May 2007 (Tr. 58-
59). She gave the car to her husband in May 2007 because she could not afford the 
$1,000 monthly payments (Tr. 51, 56-57). The BMW was her husband’s car (Tr. 51). It 
was in his possession when it was repossessed in either October 2007 or June 2008, 
depending on the credit report entry (Tr. 56-57, 59-60). She was not aware of the 
repossession until 2009 (Tr. 58). She recognized that because she co-signed on the car 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
lien, she was jointly responsible for paying the debt (Tr. 51, 57-58, 84). She did not 
make payment arrangements until July 2009 because she hoped her husband would 
take responsibility for this debt (Tr. 62). On July 1, 2009, she made a $552 payment and 
established her payment plan on a debt totaling $19,868 (AE W at 2; AE AQ; AE R; AE 
S).  
 
 Applicant’s financial problems resulted from her separation from her husband 
and his failure to pay adequate support (Tr. 66). At first, he was not paying any support 
(Tr. 66). She had to pay high levels of rent, car payments and other bills (Tr. 72). Her 
employer reduced her weekly work hours from 40 to 32 (Tr. 72). After a tough period of 
time financially, she gradually made progress (Tr. 73). Her work hours subsequently 
increased to 42, and her husband paid more child support (Tr. 73-74). On May 21, 
2009, her husband provided a statement accepting responsibility for most of the 
delinquent SOR debts and promising to pay them (AE Q). Her husband wants to 
salvage their marriage and is paying child support, even though there is no legal 
separation agreement (Tr. 74). 
 
 Applicant’s annual net salary is about $80,000 (Tr. 62-63). Additionally, she 
receives $1,500 monthly from her husband as child support (Tr. 63).  Monthly expenses 
include: rent ($1,850); groceries ($300); clothing ($50); cable, phone and internet 
($130); daughter’s school ($792); son’s daycare ($348); car payment ($678); car 
insurance ($220), gas ($350), and her new payment arrangements with the various 
SOR creditors (Tr. 66). She has a monthly remainder of about $3,400 (Tr. 66, 68-69). 
She has about $3,000 in savings (Tr. 67). She recently opened three small credit-card 
accounts in order to build a positive credit history (Tr. 67-68).  
 
Falsification of Security Clearance Application 
 
Applicant signed her SF-86 on May 29, 2008. In regard to her delinquent debts 
and repossessed vehicles, her SF-86 asked three questions. Applicant incorrectly 
responded, “No” to questions 27b, 28a and 28b (GE 1), which asked: 
 
Section 27: Your Financial Record 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
b. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any 
property repossessed for any reason? 
 
Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)? 
 
b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
 
Applicant’s SF-86 contains the following admonition: 
 
Certification That My Answers Are True 
 
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good 
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form 
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 
18, United States Code). 
 
(emphasis in original) (GE 1 at 1). Immediately below this admonition appears her 
signature (GE 1 at 1). Applicant does not contest that she signed and certified this SF-
86.2   
 
Around the time Applicant’s husband moved out of their apartment in the summer 
of 2006, Applicant and her spouse each had a list of accounts they were supposed to 
keep current (Tr. 53). There was no written separation agreement. She paid her share 
of their debts as agreed (Tr. 53). She obtained an Equifax credit report in January 2008 
before she completed her SF-86 (Tr. 51, 71). Her report did not show any delinquent 
accounts or the vehicle repossession (Tr. 51, 71). She assumed when the accounts did 
not appear on her 2008 credit report as delinquent that her husband was keeping his 
promise about paying those debts (Tr. 53-54). She did not keep a copy of the 2008 
Equifax credit report that she relied upon; however, she noted the government’s current 
report did not show delinquencies on the Equifax credit report prior to May of 2008 (Tr. 
53-54). The other credit reporting companies were the sources of the allegations about 
delinquent debts (Tr. 53). She was completely unaware of any delinquent debts when 
she completed her SF-86 (Tr. 60).  
 
When an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed 
Applicant, she denied responsibility for the SOR debts because she was unaware of her 
culpability for those debts (Tr. 70). The OPM investigator did not give her copies of the 
credit report supporting the alleged debts (Tr. 70). 
   
Applicant denied that she knowingly failed to disclose information on her SF-86 
about delinquent debts and repossession of a BMW (Tr. 72). She promised to honor her 
payment plans (AE O at 3). She emphasized she is “an honest, trustworthy person, with 
integrity and [she] would do whatever it takes to safeguard any classified information 
that [she] is in contact with” (AE O at 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
2The only derogatory information disclosed on her SF-86 was a single entry, indicating in March 
2007 she was charged with misdemeanor Theft by Check (GE 1 at Section 23). The theft charge was 
dismissed (GE 1 at Section 23).

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are 
of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her 
SOR response and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors 
were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is 
required. 
  
   Five conditions under AG ¶ 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She receives partial credit because her 
delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” I 
am convinced that she will continue with her payment plans and resolve all of her SOR 
debts. Her SOR debts do not “cast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.”  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her financial problems 
initially resulted because of separation from her spouse in 2006 and some 
underemployment as her hours were reduced.3 She does not receive full mitigating 
credit because she had sufficient information about her spouse’s irresponsibility to know 
she should have stayed in touch with creditors on joint accounts. Moreover, she did not 
establish that she acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address her delinquent 
debts after she learned of their existence. Essentially, she waited until April 2009 to 
aggressively address her delinquent debts.    
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. 
However, there are “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.” She has also established partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because she 
showed some, recent good faith4 in the resolution of her SOR debts. 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
 Applicant contested the validity of two debts. She established one debt was 
transferred (SOR ¶ 1.e for $370). She has made three $300 payments (April, May and 
June 2009) on the other debt even though there is some question about whether it is 
valid (SOR ¶ 1.d for $5,500). I will fully apply AG ¶ 20(e) to SOR ¶¶ 1.e and partially 
apply it to 1.d.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her SOR lists 13 debts totaling about $36,000. 
She paid seven debts, totaling about $4,800 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c and 1.f-1.j). She 
successfully disputed a debt for $370 (SOR ¶ 1.e). The five remaining debts are in 
established payment plans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d and 1.k-1.m). She paid about $2,500 in the 
April to July 2009 period to establish these five payment plans. In the last four months, 
her efforts have been sufficient to mitigate her SOR debts. She promised to continue to 
comply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts are resolved. I am confident 
she will keep her promise5 because of her substantial recent progress on SOR debt 
resolution.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
5 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and 
establishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of 
documentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is 
conditional. 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security 
clearance application: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On May 29, 2008, Applicant signed her SF-86, in which she failed to disclose her 
vehicle repossession and several delinquent debts. In her SOR response and at her 
hearing, she admitted that she failed to disclose required financial information. AG ¶¶ 
16(a) and 16(b) both apply and further review is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
   
Applicant disclosed on her SF-86 a Theft by Check charge, which the court 
subsequently dismissed. Her disclosure of derogatory information on her SF-86 
concerning a dismissed charge of Theft by Check is an indication she was not trying to 
hide adverse information. She said she checked her Equifax credit report in January 
2008, and there were no delinquent accounts noted. Applicant and her spouse 
separated in July 2006, and he was supposed to take care of the accounts listed on the 
SOR as delinquent. She credibly stated she was not aware of the vehicle repossession 
and delinquent SOR accounts when she completed her SF-86. I conclude Applicant’s 
alleged falsification of her SF-86 is mitigated. Although she provided false information 
on her security clearance application, AG ¶ 17(f) applies to Applicant’s failure to 
disclose financial information. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am 
satisfied she did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose her delinquent debts 
and repossessed vehicle with intent to deceive.6 I find “For Applicant” in the Findings 
section of this decision with respect to SOR ¶ 2.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission. 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct. When 
she became separated from her husband, she should have been more aggressive in 
her efforts to ensure her husband paid their joint debts as he agreed. In February 2009, 
she received the SOR. She did not actively and aggressively investigate the debts listed 
on her SOR until April 2009. These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack 
of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt and failure to provide accurate information 
on her SF-86 raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security 
violation(s). She is generally a law-abiding citizen (her only alleged criminal offense is a 
dismissed charge of Theft by Check in 2007). Her current financial problems were 
caused by some factors partially or fully beyond her control: (1) insufficient income, (2) 
separation from her spouse and (3) underemployment.  Her SOR lists 13 debts totaling 
about $36,000. She paid seven debts, totaling about $4,800. She successfully disputed 
a debt for $370. The five remaining debts are in established payment plans. She paid 
about $2,500 in the April to July 2009 period to establish these five payment plans. Her 
other debts, such as her apartment lease and car payments, are current. The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She graduated from 
high school, earned an associates degree and has almost completed her bachelor’s 
degree. She served on active duty in the Army for 2 ½ years, and received an 
honorable discharge. Her employment history and contributions to a defense contractor 
speak well for her character. She understands how to budget and what she needs to do 
to establish her financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty, 
patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the Department of Defense as an 
employee of a defense contractor.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.m: For Applicant 
 
PARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
