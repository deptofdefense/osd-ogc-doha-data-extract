HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 12 debts totaling about $35,000. 
He paid seven debts; however, he made insufficient progress resolving five debts 
totaling about $31,800. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; however, financial 
considerations concerns remain. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 25, 2008 and July 30, 2008, Applicant submitted Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance applications 
(SF-86s) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1; GE 2). On March 5, 2009, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On March 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). On May 6, 2009, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the 
case to me. On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on 
June 30, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 22-23), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 113-117, 121-122, 124; 
AE A-C). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 23), and AE A-C (Tr. 
117, 124). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the 
SOR (GE 6-8). After the hearing, Applicant provided ten exhibits (AE D-M). Department 
Counsel did not object and I admitted the ten exhibits (AE D-M). I received the transcript 
on July 9, 2009. I closed the record on July 15, 2009.      
   
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with 
explanations (GE 8). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). He 
graduated from high school in 1999 (Tr. 7). In college, he majored in information 
science and systems (Tr. 7). He graduated from college in 2005 (Tr. 7). He has held a 
secret clearance since April 2008 (Tr. 8). He has never been married and does not have 
any children (Tr. 26). He does not have any prior military service (Tr. 27). He began 
working for the defense contractor in April 2008 (Tr. 25). 
 
Summary of SOR debts 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($7,312)—Unresolved. Applicant said this was an education loan (Tr. 
28). The account became delinquent in 2008, and he said he began making payments 
in 2009 (Tr. 28-29). He thought the monthly payment was $150 (Tr. 31). He said he was 
sure he made at least one payment (Tr. 32). However, he did not provide proof of any 
payments. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,213)—Paid. A letter, dated July 2, 2009, indicated this credit card 
debt in the amount of $905 was paid (Tr. 34-40; GE 4 at 3; AE F; AE L; AE M).   
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($5,603)—Unresolved. This is an education loan (Tr. 34, 40). He said 
the creditor offered to settle the debt for two, $250 payments and that he made the two

payments (Tr. 41-43). I conclude he was confused about this settlement offer. He did 
not make any payments to this creditor in the last six months. 
  
SOR ¶ 1.d ($635)—Unresolved. This is a medical debt (Tr. 43). He said he paid 
this bill in February or March 2009 (Tr. 45). He paid using funds from his checking 
account (Tr. 46). He said he had documentation to support his claim of payment and 
would provide it to me (Tr. 46-48). However, he did not provide any post-hearing proof 
of payments on this particular medical debt. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,045)—Paid. This is a credit card debt (Tr. 49; GE 4 at 4). 
Applicant’s payment plan promised $240 payments in March, April and May 2009 (Tr. 
49-51, 60; GE 8 at 6). His creditor’s letter, dated July 2, 2009, confirmed payment of this 
debt (AE G; AE K; AE L; AE M). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($18,065)—Unresolved. On January 20, 2009, he paid $265, and on 
March 16, 2009, he paid $265 (AE L; AE M). At the hearing, he said he discussed 
payment arrangements of $150 a month; however, he did not make any $150 payments 
(Tr. 51-53). He has not made any payments in the 90 days preceding his hearing. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($157), 1.h ($142), 1.i ($274), and 1.j ($153)—Paid. These four 
medical debts are owed to the same creditor (GE 4 at 9; GE 5 at 8-9). Applicant made a 
$116 payment on March 20, 2009 (Tr. 48; GE 8 at 9, 10), and a $116 payment on May 
27, 2009 (AE I). He thought he had paid these four debts because they were to the 
same creditor (Tr. 53-57, 62-63). He asked the creditor if any more money was due and 
was advised he did not owe any more money (Tr. 53-54). The creditor wrote Applicant 
and promised to correct his credit report on two of the debts (GE 8 at 8-10).    
 
SOR ¶ 1.k ($188)—Unresolved. This is a telecommunications debt (Tr. 58). He 
was unsure about whether he had paid this debt (Tr. 58). If he had paid it, it was in 
February 2009 (Tr. 59). He averred that if he paid it, he could provide supporting 
documentation (Tr. 59). He did not provide any post-hearing documentation on this 
debt. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l ($425)—Paid. Applicant paid $205 on May 13, 2009, and $278 on 
January 6, 2009, bringing his utilities to current status (Tr. 64-67; AE J, AE L; AE M).  
 
Applicant’s work history for the previous four years and personal financial 
statement 
 
Applicant’s annual salary from 2005 to 2007 was about $35,000 to $37,000 per 
year (Tr. 81). Starting around 2007, he was unemployed or underemployed for about 
ten months (Tr. 81). During the summer of his unemployment period, he received $8 an 
hour working as a teacher’s aid for children ages three to five years old (Tr. 83). He did 
not receive unemployment benefits (Tr. 81). During his unemployment, he attended 
school and received financial support from his parents (Tr. 81). In April 2008, he began 
his current employment (Tr. 25, 81). His current annual salary is $58,900 (Tr. 78). He 
has not received a raise since he started his current employment (Tr. 79).

Applicant’s net pay after deductions is $3,160 (Tr. 88). In his savings and 
checking accounts combined, he has about $300 (Tr. 89). He does not have any other 
financial assets (Tr. 89). His monthly expenses are: rent ($1,110); car payment ($350) 
(he purchased a 2003 Ford in February 2009); car insurance ($165); gasoline ($50); 
school loan ($597);2 food ($130); utilities ($200); cable ($180); and cell phone ($150) 
(Tr. 92-101). Applicant essentially lives paycheck-to-paycheck, and only has $200 a 
month remaining after expenses (Tr. 101). He reduced his federal tax withholding so he 
would have additional funds to pay his debts (Tr. 102). He also cashed in some of his 
vacation time and used it for debt payment. His most recent tax refund in 2008 was 
about $1,500, which he used to purchase the 2003 Ford (Tr. 103). 
 
Applicant agreed to provide documentation after his hearing showing (1) his 
current pay; (2) payment status and arrangements for all SOR debts; (3) the relationship 
between the medical receipts and SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j; (4) any 
documentation showing SOR debts were paid or settled and paid; and (5) monthly 
account statements for six months with notations showing applicability to particular SOR 
debts (Tr. 121-122; AE C). After his hearing, Applicant provided records showing the 
following payments on his SOR debts:

TOTAL $3,657   
 
Applicant explained his delinquent debts resulted from “mismanagement of [his] 
finances and through various mishaps” (Tr. 104). The cost to repair his car was about 
$2,000 (Tr. 104-105). In June 2008, his apartment was vandalized, and his personal 
property, valued at around $700, was stolen (Tr. 104-105). Shortly after he purchased 
his 2003 Ford, it was vandalized (Tr. 107). 
 
                                            
2 Applicant’s February 9, 2008, credit report showed a $32,375 student loan debt in deferred 
status (GE 5 at 7). The creditor threatened to garnish his pay unless he resumed monthly payments of 
$597 starting July 1, 2009 (Tr. 92-93). He made a $597 payment on July 1, 2009 (AE I at 3).

In 2003, Applicant’s brother was murdered (Tr. 109). He provided some support 
for his deceased brother’s daughter, who is five years old (Tr. 109). For example, he 
might buy her some clothing or food if he was babysitting (Tr. 110). He wanted to create 
an educational fund for his niece (Tr. 109, 111). Applicant has not sought financial 
counseling (Tr. 108). In February 2009, Applicant’s employer selected him as employee 
of the month (Tr. 117). He contributed $28 to a charity on July 11, 2009 (AE I at 1), May 
12, 2009 (AE J at 4), April 11, 2009 (AE K at 1), March 11, 2009 (AE L at 2), February 
11, 2009 (AE M at 1), and January 13, 2009 (AE N at 2). 
 
Alleged falsification of security clearance applications (SF-86s) 
 
On January 25, 2008, and on July 30, 2008, Applicant signed his SF-86s (Tr. 69; 
GE 1, GE 2). In regard to his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicles, his SF-86 
asked three questions. Applicant responded “No” to questions 27b, 28a and 28b (GE 1; 
GE 2), which asked: 
 
Section 27: Your Financial Record 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
b. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any 
property repossessed for any reason? 
 
Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)? 
 
b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? 
 
Applicant’s SF-86 contains the following admonition: 
 
Certification That My Answers Are True 
 
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good 
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form 
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 
18, United States Code). 
 
(emphasis in original) (GE 1; GE 2). Immediately below this admonition appears his 
signature (GE 1; GE 2). Applicant admitted that he signed and certified these two SF-
86s (Tr. 69, 72).  
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant said he thought his vehicle repossession occurred in August 2008, 
which is after the dates he completed his two SF-86s (Tr. 75).3 When he completed his 
first SF-86, he had missed some payments; however, he did not believe that his debts 
were delinquent at least 90-days (Tr. 74). When he completed his second SF-86, he 
agreed he had debts that were delinquent over 90 days and explained that he failed to 
disclose the required information because of an oversight (Tr. 71, 77). He was pressed 
at work to complete a database and did not thoroughly review his answers on his SF-86 
(Tr. 71, 77). He understood that security clearance investigators obtain a credit report 
(Tr. 78). He repeatedly denied that he intentionally provided false information on his SF-
86s (Tr. 123; GE 8).     
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
 
3 Applicant’s August 7, 2008, credit report shows his vehicle payment to be 60 days late, and 
does not show any vehicle repossession(s) (Tr. 76; GE 4 at 4). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that 
are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his 
SOR response and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is 
required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Five substantial SOR debts, totaling 
about $31,800 are currently delinquent. He does not have a credible plan to address 
these five SOR debts. The deferment on his $32,000 student loan ended, and on July 1, 
2009, he made one $597 payment under threat of garnishment. His delinquent debts 
occurred under such circumstances that they are likely to recur and continue to cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of his unemployment and underemployment. He does not 
receive full mitigating credit because he has been continuously employed at a salary of 
$58,900 since April 2008. In 2009, he had an unexpected car repair expense of about 
$2,000. In June 2008, his apartment was vandalized, and his personal property, valued 
at about $700, was stolen. Shortly after he purchased the 2003 Ford, it was vandalized. 
These relatively minor unexpected expenses are insufficient to cause such large 
delinquent debts, and he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
circumstances. Applicant did not receive credit counseling and he did not provide 
payment plans showing how he was resolving five SOR debts. AG ¶ 20(c) does not 
apply.  
 
Applicant has established some, but not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because 
he showed some, recent good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR debts. He made some 
payments on several large SOR debts and resolved seven debts. I have credited 
Applicant with payment of the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($157), 1.h ($142), 1.i 
($274), and 1.j ($153) even though he only provided proof of two $116 payments. He 
credibly stated the creditor for these medical accounts told him that his medical debts 
were resolved. He also established payment of the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.b ($1,213), 1.f 
($1,045), and 1.l ($425). Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity 
of any debts and AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. He did not establish that he maintained contact 
with his creditors, or that he made or attempted to make partial payments to several of 
them.5 He said he would provide proof of SOR debt payments over the previous six 
months after his hearing. He showed payments totaling $3,657. However, over the 
April-June 2009 period, he only showed payments of $1,158 (includes $597 payment on 
his student loan, which is not an SOR debt). At his hearing, he incorrectly stated he had 
payment plans in place and was making payments (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g), and his 
$5,603 debt could be settled for about $500 and was paid (SOR ¶ 1.c). He was honest 
and credible about his good intentions, but confused and disorganized. I am convinced 
financial problems will continue.       
 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current.

Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security 
clearance application: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On January 25, 2008, and on July 30, 2008, Applicant signed SF-86s. In 
question 27b, his SF-86s asked about whether he had any repossessed property. 
Applicant correctly replied “No” because his vehicle was repossessed after July 30, 
2008.  
 
His SF-86 asked a question about debts 180-days delinquent in the last seven 
years and a question about debts currently 90-days delinquent. Applicant correctly 
responded “No” to these two questions on his January 25, 2008 SF-86 because his 
debts were not delinquent for at least 180 days or 90 days, respectively. However, he 
incorrectly answered “No” on his July 30, 2008 SF-86 because he did have debts that 
were 90-days delinquent by July 30, 2008. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) both apply and further 
review is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
   
Applicant credibly stated he carelessly rushed through his July 30, 2008 SF-86 
and failed to disclose his debts that were currently at least 90-days delinquent. He was 
working hard trying to meet deadlines for his employer, and did not show the careful, 
conscientious attention to detail necessary to properly complete his SF-86. I conclude 
Applicant’s alleged falsification of his SF-86 is mitigated. Although he provided false 
information on his SF-86, AG ¶ 17(f) applies. The falsification allegations are not 
substantiated. I am satisfied he did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his 
delinquent debts with intent to deceive.6 I find “For Applicant” in the Findings section of 
this decision with respect to SOR ¶ 2.   
 
 
 
6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
    
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is summarized in this 
paragraph; however, it is insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. There is no 
evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His security clearance 
application did not disclose any problems with alcohol or drug abuse. His financial 
problems were initially caused by unemployment and underemployment, which are 
factors somewhat beyond his control. He paid seven SOR debts. He paid his non-SOR 
debts. He has not received any new credit cards. Applicant has achieved some 
important educational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, 
responsibility and dedication. He obtained employment with his current employer in April 
2008, and has been able to maintain and continue that employment. He understands 
what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated 
his loyalty, patriotism, and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of 
Defense as a contractor. He supports his niece and contributes to charity.   
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct is more substantial. 
Several of Applicant’s debts became delinquent after his current employer hired him in 
April 2008, and his pay was increased to $58,900. At his hearing, he incorrectly stated 
he had payment plans in place and was making payments (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g). He 
also mistakenly indicated his $5,603 debt could be settled for about $500 and was paid 
(SOR ¶ 1.c). He was incorrect about these payment plans and payments. Applicant 
does not have established payment plans to address the five SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a 
($7,312), 1.c ($5,603), 1.d ($635), 1.g ($18,065), and 1.k ($188), totaling about $31,800. 
His student loan debt of approximately $32,000 was in deferment status until July 1, 
2009, and now he must continue to make monthly payments of $597 or his pay will be 
garnished.   
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
He should have made greater and more systematic progress on the five 
unresolved SOR debts. He should have acted more aggressively to pay his delinquent 
debts or to arrange and establish payment plans, and to better document his remedial 
efforts. These factors show some financial irresponsibility. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated personal conduct concerns; 
however, he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c and 1.d: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e and 1.f: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h to 1.j:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.k:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
