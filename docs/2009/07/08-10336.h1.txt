HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine debts totaling about $70,000. 
He paid or is adequately resolving three debts; however, six large delinquent debts 
totaling more than $60,000 are unresolved. Applicant failed to mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns. Personal conduct concerns regarding his filing an 
inaccurate security clearance application with the government are mitigated. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 10), pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On February 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 11). On March 23, 
2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On March 25, 2009, the case was 
assigned to me. On April 10, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (Transcript1 (Tr2.) 5). 
An initial hearing was held on April 28, 2009 (Tr1. 1-9). Applicant requested a delay to 
determine whether to hire counsel, and I approved a delay until May 26, 2009 (Tr1. 7-8). 
At the hearing held on May 26, 2009, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 
1-7) (Transcript (Tr2.) 19-20), and Applicant offered seven exhibits (Tr2. 22-24; AE A-
G). Applicant objected to consideration of the government exhibits because, “I did my 
paperwork wrong and I submitted something that was old, not—it was my fault. I 
shouldn’t have [done] that.” I will apply Applicant’s comments to the weight I give GE 1-
7. GE 1-7 were admitted (Tr2. 20). Department Counsel did not object to my 
consideration of AE A-G, and I admitted them (Tr2. 24). Additionally, I admitted the 
Notice of Hearing, Amended Hearing Notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 8-11). 
I received the transcript on June 2, 2009. I held the record open until June 5, 2009 for 
potential submission of additional evidence (Tr2. 61, 76). On June 2, 2009, I received 
one post-hearing exhibit, which was admitted without objection as AE H.    
   
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a to 1.i, and the bankruptcy allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k (GE 11). Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr2. 6, 26). He is 
currently a security guard 33 hours per week (Tr2. 27-28). He has previously held an 
interim security clearance (Tr2. 28). He received his high school diploma in 1996 and 
has completed two years of college (Tr2. 6-7). He majored in business administration in 
college (Tr2. 7, 26). He does not have any prior military experience (Tr2. 29). He has 
never married (Tr2. 31; GE 1). His children are ages 11 and six (Tr2. 31-32; GE 1). He 
disclosed one alcohol or drug offense, a DUI in 2000, as well as attendance at an 
Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (GE 1).

information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant was unemployed from April to August 2003, from January to April 2005 
and from November 2008 to April 2009 (Tr2. 30-31; GE 1). He earned $25,000 in 2005, 
$46,000 in 2006, $4,200 in 2007, and $36,834 in 2008 (Tr2. 55; AE G at 3).  
   
Applicant has the following financial issues listed in his SOR: 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,056 owed to a credit union on a credit card account). Applicant set 
up a payment arrangement to provide $50 monthly starting June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 39; AE 
A);  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b ($6,253 owed on his child support debt). He disclosed the 
garnishment of his pay to pay child support beginning in August 2001 (GE 1). As of May 
2009, he owed $5,720 (Tr2. 34; AE D). He learned the government would garnish half 
of his unemployment pay, if he did not begin making his child support payments (Tr2. 
34-35). He has been making weekly payments of $170 for the last two months (Tr2. 34-
35);  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c ($37,564 owed on his mortgage of $326,000). His mortgage became 
delinquent in November 2008 (Tr2. 41). He discussed renegotiation or loan modification 
of his mortgage with assistance from another mortgage company (Tr2. 41-42). 
Applicant’s mother and two uncles live in his residence with Applicant (Tr2. 42). His 
mother sorts mail at a private company, one uncle waits tables and the other uncle 
works for a lawn service during the day, and a pizza company at night (Tr2. 42-43). His 
two uncles and his mother are supposed to pay $500 each a month and Applicant is 
supposed to pay the remainder (Tr2. 43). His monthly mortgage payment is currently 
$2,500 a month (Tr2. 43). The most recent payment was four or five months ago when 
Applicant sent in $1,500 (Tr2. 44). The last time he paid $2,500 was probably in 
November 2008 (Tr2. 44). On April 10, 2009, he began working with a new company to 
modify his mortgage (AE C). He believed the new mortgage payment would be $1,500 
per month (Tr2. 45); 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e ($2,557 and $2,551 owed on his student loans). Applicant’s 
student loans went into default status in November 2008 (Tr2. 46). On May 20, 2009, he 
set up an arrangement to pay the creditor $100 per month (Tr2. 46; AE B). His first 
payment is due June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 46);  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f ($8,006 owed on Applicant’s BMW car loan of $50,533). In July 2007, 
he traded in his Mercedes and bought a BMW (Tr2. 47, 53-54; GE 2). He financed 
$42,000 and contracted to make $800 monthly payments (Tr2. 47). He stopped making 
payments in March 2008 (Tr2. 54; GE 2; GE 3). He called the creditor and told them to 
pick up his BMW in April 2009 (Tr2. 47-48). He was unaware about the amount of his 
debt because the creditor needed to sell his car before a balance owed could be 
determined (Tr2. 49);

 SOR ¶ 1.g ($6,284 owed to a credit union on a credit card account). Applicant set 
up a payment arrangement to provide $50 monthly starting June 20, 2009 (Tr2. 39; AE 
A); 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h ($533 owed on a lien for unpaid child support). Applicant said this 
debt is paid (Tr2. 32-37); however, he did not provide any proof of payment. He thought 
it was taken out of his pay (Tr2. 37);  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i ($212 judgment owed on a hospital bill). Applicant was working for his 
employer and was hurt on the job (Tr2. 50-51). He thought his employer should pay his 
medical bill (Tr2. 51). The hospital obtained a judgment against Applicant (Tr2. 51; GE 
6);   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j (Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed on October 25, 2007, and dismissed on 
April 18, 2008) (AE E). Applicant was unemployed and filed the bankruptcy to stop the 
foreclosure on his residence (Tr2. 52). He filed for the bankruptcy pro se and some 
documentation was incorrect (Tr2. 52). This bankruptcy was dismissed because of 
erroneous documentation (Tr2. 52); 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k (Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed on June 4, 2008, and dismissed on 
December 17, 2008) (AE E). Applicant filed because he was unemployed and wanted to 
stop the foreclosure on his residence (Tr2. 52-53). A mortgage renegotiation company 
advised Applicant to dismiss the bankruptcy and they would help him save his 
residence (Tr2. 52). 
 
 Applicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $1,699 (Tr2. 69-70). He 
plans to arrange a payment plan with the IRS (Tr2. 69-70). Applicant’s state taxes are 
current (Tr2. 70).   
 
 Applicant paid a judgment on October 3, 2006, which was filed on November 14, 
2002 (AE F). He planned to pay off his credit cards, get his mortgage caught up, and 
then pay for his car and student loans (Tr2. 67-68). His bottom line is that he planned to 
pay or resolve all of his debts. 
 
 Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) was provided as part of his 
bankruptcy filing (Schedule J) and is substantially accurate (Tr2. 63; GE 3). However, at 
the time he completed the Schedule J in 2008 he held two jobs and his income was 
$4,433 (Tr2. 64; GE 3). Now he only has one part-time job (Tr2. 64). His PFS indicates 
$3,971 in expenses (GE 3). His remainder is $462 (GE 3). Applicant has about $100 in 
checking and does not have a savings account (Tr2. 65). He does not own a car and 
does not have any credit cards (Tr2. 66). He received credit counseling as part of the 
bankruptcy process (Tr2. 66). He learned about saving money and budgeting as well as 
setting and accomplishing goals (Tr2. 66-67).

Falsification of Security Clearance Application 
 
Applicant signed his security clearance applicant on March 21, 2008. In regard to 
his financial record, and bankruptcy filings Applicant was asked three questions. 
Applicant incorrectly responded, “No” to questions 27a, 28a and 28b (GE 1), which 
asked: 
 
Section 27: Your Financial Record 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
a. In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of the 
bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)? 
 
Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)? 
 
b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? 
 
Applicant’s security clearance application contains the following admonition: 
 
Certification That My Answers Are True 
 
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good 
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form 
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 
18, United States Code). 
 
(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition is Applicant’s 
signature.  
 
Applicant did not contest that he filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on October 25, 
2007, and it was still pending when he submitted this SF-86 (Tr2. 58). He explained at 
his hearing that he applied for a job before he filed for bankruptcy (Tr2. 57). Later he 
said that he used the information from his 2003 security clearance application and just 
copied it for his March 21, 2008 SF-86 (Tr2. 59). He gave his old security clearance 
application to his employer, and they used it to type up his March 21, 2008, SF-86 (Tr2. 
75). He agrees he was negligent because he rushed through his paperwork, and failed 
to check it thoroughly (Tr2. 71). He was “trying to get a job [and he] wasn’t thinking 
about that” (Tr2. 60). However, the 2003 and 2008 SF-86s are not identical as his 2008 
SF-86 includes updated employment information from 2005, 2006 and 2007 (GE 1).

Applicant’s April 3, 2008, credit report (GE 2) (obtained shortly after he signed his 
SF-86) lists $11,957 past due on his mortgage, approximately $5,000 past due on his 
education loans, approximately $12,000 past due on his two credit union-issued credit 
cards, and a 2004 tax lien for $533.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
.  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is also documented in his SOR response and his oral statement at his 
hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about 
the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. 
  
   Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his 
delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” 
However, the problem of about $60,000 in unresolved, delinquent debt continues to 
“cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of the real estate downturn as well as his periods of 
unemployment or underemployment. He does not receive full mitigating credit because 
he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling as part of his 
bankruptcy. However, there are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control” because six debts totaling over $60,000 remain unresolved. He has 
also established some, but not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed 
some, recent good faith2 in the resolution of his SOR debts by paying his child support.  
 
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any debts. 
However, I will apply AG ¶ 20(e) to SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($533 owed on state tax lien for unpaid 
child support) and 1.i ($212 judgment owed on a hospital bill). Applicant said the $533 
debt is paid. He thought his employer should pay the $212 debt because he was injured 
on the job. He credibly disputes these two debts. Moreover, they constitute less than 
two percent of his total delinquent debt.3  
 
I will briefly provide an additional explanation about my reasons for mitigating or 
not mitigating the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k in the Formal Findings 
section of this decision at page 13, infra: 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is mitigated because he has a payment plan and is making payments 
on his child support payments, although he conceded it was under threat of renewed 
garnishment of his pay, and he owes about $5,000 in overdue child support.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is not mitigated. Applicant owes at least $37,564 on his mortgage of 
$326,000. His mortgage became delinquent in November 2008. Although he used the 
bankruptcy filings and attempted renegotiation or loan modification of his mortgage, he 
did not take sufficient action to establish financial responsibility. His most recent 
payment was four or five months ago when Applicant sent in $1,500. The last time he 
paid $2,500 was probably in November 2008. He did not provide a payment history from 
his mortgage company or by using bank account statements. He did not adequately 
connect his periods of unemployment and underemployment with the failure to pay his 
mortgage.   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k are mitigated. Applicant filed for bankruptcy to stop 
foreclosure on his residence. It is a fairly common and legal practice of businesses and 
individuals to file bankruptcy to obtain some temporary relief from creditors.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts have been insufficient 
in regard to six delinquent debts, totaling more than $60,000. Applicant promised to pay 
the remaining SOR debts; however, I am not confident he will keep that promise 
because of his lack of meaningful progress on SOR debt resolution demonstrated over 
the last two years. He did not provide sufficient information to establish that he could not 
have made partial payments on several of the six debts.

outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App.

at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current.

Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case in regard to providing false documentation to his employer: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On March 21, 2008, Applicant signed his security clearance application, in which 
he failed to disclose his bankruptcy filing and several delinquent debts. At his hearing, 
he admitted that he failed to disclose required financial information. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 
16(b) both apply and further review is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
   
Applicant disclosed a DUI offense and the garnishment of his child support on his 
SF-86. He said his employer simply copied his 2001 security clearance application, 
apparently only including updates of his employment and perhaps some other limited 
information. His disclosure of other derogatory information on his SF-86 is an indication 
he was not trying to hide adverse information. I conclude Applicant’s alleged falsification 
of his security clearance application is mitigated. Although he provided false information 
on his security clearance application, AG ¶ 17(f) applies to Applicant’s failure to disclose 
financial information. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am satisfied he 
did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his delinquent debts and bankruptcy 
filing with intent to deceive.4 I find “For Applicant” in the Findings section of this decision 
with respect to SOR ¶ 2.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is insufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security 
violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding citizen (his only criminal offense is a DUI in 
2000). His current financial problems were partially caused by some factors partially or 
fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income, (2) the real estate downturn, (3) 
unemployment, and (4) underemployment. He paid or resolved two small SOR debts. 
He started paying his delinquent child support. He has new payment plans with several 
creditors. He promised to pay his delinquent debts.   
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high 
school and has some college. His employment history and contributions to a defense 
contractor speak well for his character. He understands how to budget and what he 
needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his 
loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense 
as a contractor. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial 
responsibility. However, all of these positive attributes are insufficient to mitigate 
security concerns at this time.  
 
The evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct is more substantial. 
Applicant’s six delinquent debts have been delinquent for a substantial period of time. 
He has not paid anything to his mortgage in several months. He purchased a BMW and 
then did not make any payments for more than a year on his car loan. He did not 
establish that he could not have made greater progress addressing his delinquent 
debts. He has admitted a total of six delinquent debts, totaling more than $60,000 in 
arrearages, and he has not paid anything to these six creditors in the several months 
prior to his hearing. He showed some effort to increase his income by working two jobs, 
but he did not make enough effort to reduce his expenses and/or to pay at least partial 
payments on his SOR debts. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted with sufficient 
effort and self-discipline to resolve his delinquent debts and to better document his 
remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much financial 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises unmitigated 
security concerns.   
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated personal 
conduct security concerns; however, he has not sufficiently mitigated financial 
considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c to 1.g: Against Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.h to 1.k: For Applicant 
 
PARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
