HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 21 debts totaling about $41,300. 
She paid seven debts, totaling about $2,900. One debt was disputed. She has 
established payment plans for resolving her remaining SOR debts. Financial 
consideration concerns are mitigated. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated 
because she did not intentionally fail to list some of her delinquent debts on her security 
clearance application. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 12) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated

by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On December 8, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 13). In February 
2009, Applicant’s case was referred to an administrative judge. On February 18, 2009 
and March 5, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices (GE 8, 9). The hearing was cancelled 
after Applicant’s sponsor terminated her employment and sponsorship. 
 
In May 2009, a government contractor sponsored Applicant for a security 
clearance. On June 10, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On June 18, 2009, and 
June 25, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices (GE 10, 11). On July 9, 2009, Applicant’s 
hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 21-22), and Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 23-26; AE A-D). There 
were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 22), and AE A-D (Tr. 23-26). 
Additionally, I admitted four Notices of Hearings, the SOR,1 and her response to the 
SOR (GE 8-13). After the hearing, Applicant provided six exhibits (AE E-J). I received 
the transcript on July 17, 2009. On July 20, 2009, Department Counsel did not object, 
and that same day I admitted Applicant’s six exhibits (AE E-J).   
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted she owed and had not paid the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.n, 1.o, 1.t, and 1.u (GE 13). She said these eight debts 
were in a payment plan or a debt consolidation plan (GE 13). She denied the other 
debts because they were either duplications, had inaccurate amounts, or were paid (GE 
13). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 28 years old and is seeking employment by a defense contractor (Tr. 
6, 27). She graduated from high school in 1998 (Tr. 7). She completed three years of 
college, where she majored in psychology (Tr. 7). She previously held a top secret 
clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information when she was on active 
duty in the U.S. Army (Tr. 8). She was on active duty in the Army from June 25, 1998 to 
January 23, 2006 (Tr. 9). Her military occupational specialty was administrative 
 
1 At Department Counsel’s request, I amended SOR ¶ 2(a) at the hearing to correct a 
typographical error (Tr. 18). The SOR and response to SOR are the pleadings in the case. The hearing 
notices, SOR and response to SOR are admitted and given exhibit numbers for ease of reference in this 
decision.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

assistant (Tr. 29-30). She was a sergeant promotable to staff sergeant when she was 
discharged with an honorable discharge (Tr. 9, 31). She did not serve in a combat zone 
while on active duty (Tr. 9). She received two Good Conduct Medals, two Army 
Commendation Medals and two Army Achievement Medals (Tr. 30). She does not 
currently hold a security clearance (Tr. 8). She has never been married (Tr. 27). She 
has a three-year-old son (Tr. 27). Her son’s father was enlisted when they had their 
relationship, and he was subsequently commissioned as an officer (Tr. 124).   
 
After Applicant left active duty, four different companies employed her from 
January 2006 to July 2007 (Tr. 31-32).  From July 25, 2007, to September 26, 2007, 
she was unemployed (Tr. 32-33). From September 27, 2007 to February 13, 2009, a 
company employed her as a program analyst (Tr. 32). Beginning in August 2008, her 
income gradually declined from $5,000 per month to about $2,500 per month. Her 
employer gradually reduced her hours as the end of their government contract 
approached (Tr. 90). She has been unemployed since February 13, 2009 (Tr. 32).  She 
currently has an offer of employment from a defense contractor for $5,000 per month 
(Tr. 32, 43).   
 
In June 2006, Applicant’s financial difficulties began (Tr. 56). She emphasized 
lack of child support payments from her son’s father were a significant cause of her 
financial problems. Her son was born in February 2006 (GE 1). She paid $2,500 to 
$3,000 to her lawyer and for court costs to ensure she received child support payments 
(Tr. 37). In August 2008, she began receiving monthly, court-ordered child support 
payments (Tr. 34). Her son’s father is now an active-duty captain in the U.S. Army (Tr. 
35). He resisted making his child support payments for two years (Tr. 35). Since 
October 2008, he has paid $555 for child support and an additional $145 for child 
support arrearage (Tr. 36-37). In April 2009, she began receiving $1,612 monthly for 
unemployment compensation (Tr. 41).     
 
Between October 2008 and July 2009, Applicant used debt consolidation 
companies that were affiliated with each other (DCCI and DCCII) as her primary 
vehicles to resolve her delinquent debts (Tr. 59-60; GE 13 at 1). In October 2008, she 
planned to use DCC1 resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.t (GE 13 
at 1). Her first payment to DCC1 was $400 (AE B at 1), and then she increased her 
monthly payment to $667 (Tr. 61).3 Her last payment to DCCI was on January 2, 2009 
in the amount of $1,602 (Tr. 62). However, in April 2009, she stopped making payments 
to DCCI and began paying a second debt consolidation company (DCCII). DCCII was 
affiliated with DCCI and is now working on resolving her debts (Tr. 62-63). Her checking 
account statements show payments to DCCII of $100 on April 9, 2009; $360 on May 1, 
2009, and $360 on June 2, 2009 (Tr. 88; AE B at 15, 17, 19, 21). She subsequently 
added more SOR debts for DCCII to resolve (Tr. 86-88). Applicant received financial 
counseling while she was on active duty and subsequently from DCCI and DCCII (Tr. 
58). In October 2008, she generated a detailed budget (GE 5 at 6, 24-26).  
 
3 Her checking account statement showed $400 paid on October 1, 2008 (AE B at 1), $350 paid 
on November 3, 2008 (AE B at 3), $667 paid on December 1, 2008 (AE B at 5), $1,602 paid on January 
2, 2009 (AE B at 7).

Current status of SOR debts 
 
Applicant accepted responsibility for ten SOR debts and plans to pay them using 
DCCII. The specific source and status of those ten SOR are as follows: 1.b ($180—
medical debt—not paid) (Tr. 86-88);  1.c ($577—payday loan—not paid) (Tr. 65-66);  
1.d ($161—being paid down) (Tr. 71-72); 1.e and 1.k ($1,485—duplication resulting 
from account overdraft—being paid down) (Tr. 66-69, 103-105); 1.l ($172—store debt—
not paid) (Tr. 105); 1.o ($1,002—utility debt—being paid down) (Tr. 69-70); 1.p ($597—
being paid down) (Tr. 74-77); 1.q ($420—collection company—not paid); and 1.t 
($6,946—Army and Air Force Exchange System—being paid down) (Tr. 70).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($18,936). Applicant has retained the vehicle on which she owes 
$18,936. Her last payment of $600 was in July 2007 (Tr. 82). She has made sporadic 
efforts to re-establish the currency of the account (Tr. 82-83). She periodically contacts 
the creditor to let the creditor know she intends to pay her debt and she asks for 
deferment on payments until her financial circumstances improve (Tr. 83-84).    
 
SOR ¶ 1.f ($995—account overdraft). This debt was paid by DCCI (Tr. 72-73). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g ($300—education debt). This debt was paid in 2008 (Tr. 92-93).  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i ($187 and $360—cable services debt). Applicant returned a 
cable box and paid the $187 on May 11, 2009 (Tr. 93-94). Both debts are resolved.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,100—Department of Defense Finance and Accounting Service 
(DFAS)) is disputed. At her Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, Applicant 
said she thought the Army over paid her prior to her separation from the service, and 
DFAS was attempting to collect the overpayment (Tr. 102). She also thought this debt 
was being turned over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for collection; however, 
DFAS and the IRS were not able to provide information about the basis of the debt or 
even that she owed this debt (Tr. 95, 99-101). Ultimately DFAS informed her that this 
debt was cancelled (Tr. 96, 102-103).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.m ($147-telecommunications debt). This debt was paid on September 
8, 2008 (Tr. 106-108; GE 6 at 40). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n ($622—department store account). This debt was paid (Tr. 77-80). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.r ($290—supermarket—returned check). Applicant paid this debt on 
April 14, 2008 (Tr. 112-113; AE D). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.s ($604—collection company). In July 2009, Applicant paid $210 to this 
creditor and intends to pay the remainder at the end of July 2009 (Tr. 109-110; AE I). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.u ($3,952—apartment lease). Applicant was making payments of $329 
per month; however, in December 2008, she stopped making payments because of her 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
pending unemployment (Tr. 110-111). She promised to resume payments of $329 per 
month when she obtains employment (Tr. 111). 
    
Applicant’s federal tax refund was provided to a debt collector to pay a non-SOR 
education debt (Tr. 97). As of July 17, 2009, she still owes $1,653 on this education 
debt (AE J). She promised to pay the remainder of this debt as soon as she is 
reemployed (Tr. 97-99).  
  
Applicant’s personal financial statement 
 
On October 6, 2008, Applicant’s provided a personal financial statement (PFS) in 
response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 5 at 6). Her PFS showed net pay after 
deductions of $5,195 and other income of $2,050 (includes $550 in child support 
received) (GE 5 at 6, 22). Her monthly expenses were: rent ($1,775); groceries ($300); 
clothing ($150); utilities ($279); car expenses ($831—includes car payment of $571); 
day care ($700); and miscellaneous ($1,872) (GE 5 at 6, 22). At the time of her hearing, 
she had moved in with a friend and was not paying any rent (Tr. 43).  She contributes 
$300 for groceries (Tr. 45). Her expenses such as car expenses and daycare are about 
the same as in October 2008 (Tr. 45-49).  She has less than $100 in her savings and 
checking accounts (Tr. 50-51). Her student loans are in deferment status (Tr. 52-55).    
 
Applicant’s October 2008 budget showed monthly payments to seven SOR 
creditors totaling $768: 1.c ($18 on $577 debt); 1.d ($30 on $577 debt); 1.e ($55 on 
$1,810 debt); 1.h ($187 on $187 debt); 1.l ($172 on $172 debt); 1.o ($153 on $1,035 
debt); and 1.t ($153 on $6,946 debt) (GE 5 at 6, 24).   
 
Applicant’s October 2008 budget also showed monthly payments to five non-
SOR creditors totaling $1,140: $17 on unknown amount; $300 on a $300 debt; $421 on 
$421 debt; $59 on $59 debt; and $360 on a $360 debt (GE 5 at 24, 25).  
 
Applicant was unable to maintain this level of payments into DCCI or DCCII after 
October 2008. Applicant’s income was significantly decreased by her subsequent 
underemployment from October 2008 to February 2009 and her unemployment after 
February 2009. 
 
Alleged falsification of security clearance applications (SF-86s) 
 
On January 3, 2008, Applicant completed her SF-86 (Tr. 113; GE 1). In regard to 
her delinquent debts, her SF-86 asked two questions. Applicant responded “No” to 
question 28a and “Yes” to question 28b (GE 1). Her SF-86 required her to explain any 
“Yes” answers. However, the only debt she disclosed was her $18,936 delinquent car 
loan as indicated in SOR ¶ 1.a. Questions 28a and 28b asked:

Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies 
 
Answer the following questions. 
 
a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)? 
 
b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? 
 
Applicant’s SF-86 contains the following admonition: 
 
Certification That My Answers Are True 
 
My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good 
faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form 
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 
18, United States Code). 
 
(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition appears her signature 
(GE 1). Applicant admitted that she signed and certified this SF-86 (Tr. 113-115).  
 
Applicant explained that when she completed her SF-86 she was not aware that 
the other debts were delinquent over 90 days (Tr. 114-119). She thought she was 
making the minimum payments necessary to keep her accounts current (Tr. 119). She 
obtained a credit report and provided it to the OPM investigator (Tr. 117). She went over 
her debts with the OPM investigator and provided detailed information about her debts 
and accounts (Tr. 117-119). She denied that she intentionally provided false information 
on her SF-86 (Tr. 114-119).  
 
On May 5, 2009, Applicant submitted an SF-86 (AE A).  She disclosed multiple 
financial problems on her SF-86, including her DCC plan (AE A).  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).

Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
[g]overnment’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that 
are of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her 
OPM interview, her responses to DOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and her 
oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. 
The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). 
Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.

Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Ten SOR debts, totaling about $14,000 
are in a payment plan that DCCII is managing. Seven SOR debts, totaling about $2,900 
are paid. The debt to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.j is disputed. She has individual payment 
plans for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.s, and 1.u, totaling about $23,500. Once she 
obtains employment, which is likely because a contractor has sponsored her clearance 
application, her delinquent debts are likely to be paid and unlikely to recur. They do not 
cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her financial problems 
initially resulted because of unemployment, underemployment, and her son’s father’s 
failure to pay child support for the first two years of his life.4 She does not receive full 
mitigating credit because she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative 
and resolve to address her delinquent debts. She did not provide sufficient 
documentation about her income and expenditures over the last two years to receive full 
credit under AG ¶ 20(b). 
   
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling and prepared a 
detailed budget. Moreover, she demonstrated a firm grasp of budgeting, payment plans, 
and expense reduction. She dramatically reduced her expenses when she became 
unemployed, and still managed to make some payments to DCCII out of her 
unemployment compensation and child support payments. She has the self-discipline 
necessary to reduce and resolve her debts. There are “clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” She has also established full mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(d) because she showed good faith5 in the resolution of her SOR debts.   
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition]. 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                            
Applicant contested the validity of her $1,100 debt to DFAS. AG ¶ 20(e) does not 
apply because of the lack of documentation supporting her dispute. However, under all 
the circumstances, I considered her statements to be sufficient to refute this debt. I am 
convinced if DFAS establishes that Applicant owes the government money, she will 
repay the government.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her debts resulted from lack of child support, 
underemployment, and unemployment. Her SOR listed 21 debts totaling about $41,300. 
She paid seven debts. Ten debts are being resolved through DCCII. One debt is 
disputed. Three debts are in separate payment plans. She promised to continue to 
comply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts are resolved. I am confident 
she will keep her promise6 because of her continued progress on SOR debt resolution 
despite her unemployment.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security 
clearance application: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and 
establishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of 
documentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is 
conditional.

(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
On January 3, 2008, Applicant provided an SF-86, which asked questions about 
debts more than 180-days delinquent in the last seven years and about debts currently 
more than 90-days delinquent. Applicant correctly responded “Yes” to the question 
about debts currently 90-days delinquent. She disclosed her largest debt, a car loan of 
almost $19,000, which was delinquent over 90 days. She admitted she failed to disclose 
other, smaller debts that were also delinquent over 90 days. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) both 
apply because she provided an incomplete answer about her delinquent debts. Further 
review is necessary. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
   
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant credibly stated that when she completed her SF-86, she was not aware 
that other, smaller debts were also delinquent over 90 days. In January 2008, she was 
attempting to keep her smaller debts current by making minimal payments. On February 
20, 2008, she provided detailed information about her delinquent debts to an OPM 
investigator. She also provided a credit report to the OPM investigation. In May 2009, 
she completed an SF-86 and provided complete information about her delinquent debts. 
She was candid and forthright at her hearing about her financial problems. I conclude 
Applicant’s alleged falsification of her SF-86 is mitigated. Although she provided 
incomplete information on her January 3, 2008 SF-86, AG ¶ 17(f) fully applies. The 
falsification allegations are not substantiated. I am satisfied she did not deliberately and 
intentionally fail to disclose her delinquent debts with intent to deceive.7 I find “For 
Applicant” in the Findings section of this decision with respect to SOR ¶ 2.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission. 
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
   There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct. In 
October 2008, her monthly income, including child support, was about $7,500. In 
October 2008, she established a payment plan with DCCI. However, she had sufficient 
income to have made greater progress resolving her delinquent debts. She should have 
been more aggressive in her efforts to ensure she established payment plans to resolve 
her delinquent debts. She did not fully document her payments to her creditors, and her 
communications to creditors about her debts. These factors show some financial 
irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt raises sufficient 
security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of a security 
violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. Her current financial problems were caused by 
factors beyond her control: (1) insufficient income; (2) her son’s father’s failure to pay 
child support over the first two years of his son’s life; (3) unemployment, especially after 
February 2009; and (4) underemployment. Her SOR lists 21 debts totaling about 
$41,300. She paid seven debts, totaling about $2,900. Ten debts totaling about $14,000 
are in DCCII’s payment plan. She has a payment plan for three SOR debts; however, 
she is currently only paying into one of the plans because of her current unemployment. 
She disputes her DFAS debt. Applicant has been unemployed since February 2009, 
and receives substantial credit for making some payments to DCCII and to her other 
creditors when she is under great financial pressure (her current income is only about 
$2,300 a month from unemployment compensation and child support). The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR.

Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility, and dedication. She graduated from 
high school, completed three years towards her bachelor degree in psychology, and 
received an honorable discharge from the Army after more than seven years of service. 
She earned two Good Conduct Medals, two Army Commendation Medals, and two 
Army Achievement Medals. Her employment history and contributions to a defense 
contractor speak well for her character. She completed financial counseling. She 
understands how to budget and what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism, and 
trustworthiness through her service to the U.S. Army and to the Department of Defense 
as an employee of a defense contractor.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.u: For Applicant 
 
PARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
