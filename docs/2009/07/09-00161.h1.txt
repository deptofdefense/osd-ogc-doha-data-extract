HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed five debts totaling $28,200. She 
paid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her other two SOR 
debts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. Applicant mitigated 
financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 4, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 6), pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations)(GE 6). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On April 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 7). On June 1, 2009, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On June 2, 2009, DOHA assigned the 
case to me. On June 15, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 5). At the hearing 
held on July 8, 2009, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 11-3) (Tr. 18-19), 
and Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-C). There were no objections to 
admission of the proffered documents, and I admitted them (Tr. 19, 22). I admitted the 
Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 5-7). On July 16, 2009, I 
received the transcript. On July 23, 2009, I received seven post-hearing exhibits. These 
seven exhibits were admitted without objection as AE D-J. I closed the record on July 
24, 2009.    
   
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 23). She 
graduated from high school in 1987 (Tr. 6, 24). She does not have any prior military 
service (Tr. 27). In May 1992, she received a bachelor of science degree with a major in 
business administration (Tr. 7, 24). She has some post-graduate education in 
operations management (Tr. 8). She is a management analyst (Tr. 23). She currently 
does not have access to classified information (Tr. 8). She has held a public trust 
position from September 2008 to October 2008, when it was changed to an interim 
secret clearance (Tr. 8, 25-27). Her interim Secret clearance was suspended in April 
2009 (Tr. 27). She has not been involved in any security-related incidents (Tr. 28).  
 
Applicant has been married for the last 17 years (Tr. 23). She does not have any 
children (Tr. 23). She and her husband recently moved from one state (T) to another 
state (V) (Tr. 24). They own their home in state T. It is valued at about $115,000 (Tr. 
99). In February 2009, she and her husband moved in with Applicant’s sister in state V 
(Tr. 24, 110).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment and 
underemployment (Tr. 117). After her income was substantially reduced because of 
changes in her employment status, she attempted to keep her accounts current, and 
then when she was unable to make payments, she negotiated and renegotiated her

payment plans (Tr. 117). She did not want to resolve her debts through bankruptcy (Tr. 
117-118). She maintained contact with her creditors. 
 
From 1999 to 2007, Applicant worked for a non-profit corporation (Tr. 105). 
Applicant was unemployed from January 2007 to October 2008 (Tr. 103). Her 
husband’s annual pay until 2004 was about $45,000 (Tr. 105). In July 2004, her 
husband went on disability and began receiving about $1,300 per month (Tr. 106). 
While she was unemployed, she and her husband lived on savings and money 
borrowed from family and friends (Tr. 104). When her parents passed away, she 
received the proceeds from some small life insurance policies (Tr. 104). She held some 
part-time employment during January 2007 to October 2008 (AE C). 
 
Applicant’s adjusted gross income from 2003 to September 2008 was as follows: 
2003--over $100,000; 2004--$97,000; 2005--$61,000; 2006--$60,000; 2007--$23,272 
and January to September 2008--$16,256 (Tr. 106-109; AE C).   
 
 On August 1, 2009, a tenant will begin paying monthly rent of $830 on 
Applicant’s home in state T (Tr. 80-83; AE A at 8-9). Applicant received an $830 deposit 
from the tenant (AE A at 10). Her mortgage payment on the house in state T is $898, 
and it is current (Tr. 81-82). Her mortgage is about $114,500 (GE 2 at 4). She pays 
$345 monthly to keep her equity loan of about $16,000 on her house current (Tr. 82; GE 
2 at 4).  
 
Applicant bought a time-share property in 2004 for $14,000 (Tr. 83-85). After 
paying about $4,000, she was unable to continue to make payments because of 
unemployment (Tr. 85). She did a deed transfer back to the owners, and paid $250 (Tr. 
85). The time-share property was not foreclosed and there is no adverse information 
about the deed-transfer transaction in her credit reports (Tr. 85). 
 
Applicant’s SOR did not describe any bankruptcy filings. However, it listed five 
delinquent debts, which are fully discussed in the next five paragraphs. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a ($18,163 owed on a judgment)—Payment Plan. In January 2007, as 
soon as Applicant became unemployed she informed the creditor, and the creditor told 
her to continue to make at least the minimal monthly payments of $326 (Tr. 36-37). In 
February 2008, the account became delinquent because Applicant had been 
unemployed for a year and had only made sporadic payments (Tr. 34). In October 2008, 
she contacted the creditor (Tr. 33). The creditor advised her that the creditor transferred 
her account to a law firm (Tr. 32). In December 2008, Applicant sent a written offer to 
make monthly payments of $200, starting February 20, 2009 (GE 2 at 14). In January 
2009, she received a summons for the judgment (Tr. 33). The creditor obtained a 
judgment for $18,163. From February to July 2009, she paid the creditor $1,500 in 
accordance with her payment plan, reducing the amount of the debt to about $16,800 
as follows: $200 in February (GE 7 at 9); $200 in March (GE 6 at 2); $200 in April (GE 6 
at 2; AE E at 2); $300 in May (AE A at 3, 5); $300 in June; and $300 in July (Tr. 41-44; 
GE 6 at 2; AE A at 2; AE F). She intends to continue making monthly payments of at 
least $300.

 SOR ¶ 1.b ($374 owed to a telecommunications company)—Paid. Applicant 
switched phone services and was unaware of the debt until DOHA informed her of its 
existence (Tr. 46-50). She paid half on May 1, 2009, and the other half on June 1, 2009 
(Tr. 50; AE G). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c ($3,979 owed to a credit card company)—Payment Plan. In January 
2007, as soon as Applicant became unemployed, she informed the creditor of the 
change in her employment status (Tr. 53-54). In April 2009, she and the creditor agreed 
that she would make an initial payment of $435, and $100 monthly thereafter through 
December 2009 (Tr. 56-60; AE F at 1). She provided documentation showing the 
following payments: April 20, 2009--$435 (Tr. 56; GE 9 at 13); April 21, 2009--$100 (AE 
F at 2); May 28, 2009--$100 (AE A at 5); June 18, 2009--$100 (AE A at 4); and July 13, 
2009--$100 (AE F at 4). She currently owes $500 on this debt (Tr. 57-60). Once the tax 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.e is paid, she will use the extra $300 a month to pay this debt (Tr. 102). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d ($3,091 owed to credit card company)—Paid. On October 18, 2008, 
Applicant made a written offer to the creditor to pay $60 a month (Tr. 64; GE 7 at 21). 
On November 17, 2008, the creditor wrote Applicant about settlement terms (GE 7 at 
20). On January 20, 2009 and February 20, 2009, Applicant paid the creditor $75 (Tr. 
64; GE 7 at 18, 19). On February 18, 2009, she paid the creditor $100 (GE 7 at 15). In 
an undated letter, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $1,765 (GE 7 at 17). At some 
point the settlement amount was reduced to $1,176, and on April 20, 2009, Applicant 
paid $1,176 (Tr. 63; GE 7 at 16). Credit records, dated June 12, 2009, reflect this debt 
as paid (Tr. 65; AE A at 6). 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e ($2,632 owed for delinquent property taxes)—Account is current. A 
county property tax bill, dated March 12, 2009, showed that she owed $1,442 for tax 
year 2007 and $1,208 for tax year 2008 (Tr. 68; GE 2 at 23). On April 17, 2009, she 
paid $1,442 (Tr. 68; GE 7 at 22). A subsequent tax record shows all property taxes for 
the years 1994 to 2008 were paid, except for tax year 2008 (AE A at 7). This country 
property tax record showed she owed $964 for tax year 2008 (AE A at 7). She learned 
she has until September 30, 2009, to pay the property taxes for 2008 (Tr. 69). On June 
28, 2009, she paid $300 towards her 2008 county property tax debt (Tr. 70; AE A at 7).  
As of July 14, 2009, she owed $664 (AE H). She planned to pay $300 in July 2009 and 
the balance of $364 in August 2009 (Tr. 70). 
 
 Applicant has three non-SOR related credit cards and a car loan of about $7,000 
(Tr. 72-73). Her car loan is current (Tr. 73). One credit card has a balance of $1,400, 
another has a balance of about $4,700, and the third credit card had a $12 balance (Tr. 
74, 77). She paid the account with a $12 balance, and the other two credit cards are 
current (Tr. 74-76). She pays a total of $245 monthly to keep the two credit cards 
current (Tr. 78-79). Her student loan of about $21,000 is in forbearance until January 
2010 (Tr. 73; GE 2 at 4). She paid off another non-SOR credit card debt (Tr. 75).  She 
borrowed $9,000 from her sister and is repaying her with monthly $300 payments (Tr. 
97). She borrowed $2,300 from her brother and $4,000 from a friend; however, they 
have agreed that she does not need to make payments until her financial situation has 
stabilized (Tr. 97; GE 2 at 4-5). She is not required to pay interest on the loans from her 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
family and a friend (Tr. 123-124). She also plans to stay with her sister until she reaches 
financial stability (Tr. 124-125). She expects to reach financial stability, including 
repaying her family and friend, in about a year (Tr.125). She anticipates all SOR debts, 
including the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, will be paid in 18 months (Tr. 125).   
 
 On February 24, 2009, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement (GE 2 
at 4). Her gross salary is $5,833, and her net salary is $4,534 (Tr. 86).  Her husband 
receives $1,545 in monthly disability payments, and their monthly rent from their home 
in state T is $830 (Tr. 86). Monthly expenses are as follows: food ($150); clothing 
($100); cell phone ($75); car payment ($794); car insurance ($170); other car expenses 
($500); life and medical insurance ($210); and miscellaneous ($200) (Tr. 87-93).  After 
paying her monthly expenses and debt payments about $2,300 remains, which she 
plans to use to rapidly pay her balances owed to various creditors (Tr. 99).  She has 
enrolled in consumer credit counseling (AE D, I). 
 
 Applicant’s sister has worked for the Department of Defense for 28 years (AE B). 
Her descriptions of Applicant‘s unemployment and Applicant’s spouse’s medical 
disability are consistent with Applicant’s disclosures above. Her sister described 
Applicant’s numerous positive character traits, including her dedication, discipline, 
integrity, honesty, loyalty, and good judgment (AE B). Her sister recommends 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance.  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are 
of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her 
SOR response and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors 
were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is 
required. 
  
   Five conditions under AG ¶ 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts after 
returning to employment in September 2008.3 Her delinquent debts are “a continuing 
course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-
11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 
2002)). She receives partial credit because her delinquent debts “occurred under such 
circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” I am convinced that she will continue 
with her payment plans and resolve all of her SOR debts. Her SOR debts do not “cast 
doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  
 
 
3 For example, Applicant could have made monthly payments of $100 to $200 to the creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.a from October 2008 to February 2009 without waiting for a payment plan to be established.

Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her financial problems 
initially resulted because of unemployment, underemployment and her spouse’s 
disability.4 She does not receive full mitigating credit because she did not establish that 
she acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address her delinquent debts.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant began her financial counseling. Moreover, she 
demonstrated a firm grasp of budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. She 
has the self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve her debts. There are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” She has also 
established full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because she showed good faith5 in the 
resolution of her SOR debts.   
 
Applicant did not contest the validity of any debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her SOR listed five debts totaling about 
$28,200. She paid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her 
other two SOR debts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. In 
October 2008, she began the process of establishing payment plans and resolved some 
of her delinquent debts, substantially before she received the SOR on April 6, 2009. 
She promised to continue to comply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts 
are resolved. I am confident she will keep her promise6 because of her substantial 
recent progress on SOR debt resolution.    
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

6 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context

Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct. When 
she was began her new employment in September 2008, she should have been more 
aggressive in her efforts to ensure she established payment plans on her delinquent 
debts. She had sufficient income to make greater progress in delinquent debt resolution. 
These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of 
delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security 
violation(s). She is a law-abiding citizen. Her current financial problems were caused by 
factors beyond her control: (1) insufficient income; (2) her spouse’s disability; (3) 
unemployment; and (4) underemployment. Her SOR lists five debts totaling about 
$28,200. She paid two debts, and her county property tax account is now current. Her 
other two SOR debts, totaling about $17,500, are in established payment plans. Her 
other debts, such as her car payments, mortgage, line of credit, credit cards and student 
loan are current or in forbearance. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in 
the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and 
establishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of 
documentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is 
conditional.

In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She graduated from 
high school, earned a bachelor of science degree, and has accumulated some post-
graduate credits towards her master’s degree. Her employment history and 
contributions to a defense contractor speak well for her character. She understands how 
to budget and what she needs to do to establish her financial responsibility. Applicant 
has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the 
Department of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is eligible for access to classified information.

Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
