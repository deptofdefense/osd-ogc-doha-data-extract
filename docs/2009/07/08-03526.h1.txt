HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed five debts totaling about $24,500. 
He paid three debts, and the other two are in payment plans. He made sufficient 
progress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security concerns. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 5, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On May 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). On May 6, 2009, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the 
case to me. On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on 
July 8, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) 
(Transcript (Tr.) 24-25), and Applicant offered six exhibits (Tr. 37-38, 48-49, 56, 62, 116-
118; AE A-F). Applicant objected to the government’s credit report, dated February 19, 
2009, because he believed his credit report, dated June 23, 2009, should be used 
because it is more recent (Tr. 25-26; GE 3). There were no other objections, and I 
admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 26-27), and AE A-F (Tr. 38, 49, 56, 62, 122). Additionally, I 
admitted documents addressing jurisdiction, Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to 
the SOR (GE 5-8). After the hearing, Applicant provided eight exhibits (AE G-N). 
Department Counsel did not object and I admitted the eight exhibits (AE G-N). I 
received the transcript on July 15, 2009. I closed the record on July 23, 2009 (Tr. 115).      
   
Procedural issue 
 
 On June 22, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was cancelled because Applicant’s 
sponsorship was lost (Tr. 15; GE 5). I rescheduled his hearing after DOHA established 
a different defense contractor was sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance (Tr. 15-
19; GE 5). 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the SOR debts with 
explanations (GE 8). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 29). He works 
as a logistics research analyst (Tr. 23, 29). In 1993, he received his graduate 
equivalency diploma (GED) (Tr. 6, 31). He has completed two years towards his 
bachelor of arts degree with a major in criminal justice (Tr. 6, 31). He anticipates 
receiving his bachelor’s degree in 2011 (Tr. 31). He served on active duty in the Army 
for 11 years and left active duty as a sergeant (E-5) (Tr. 7). His military occupational 
specialty in the Army was logistics (Tr. 7). He has held a Secret security clearance for 
about 13 years (Tr. 34). He currently holds a Secret security clearance (Tr. 7, 34). He 
has never had a security incident (Tr. 34).

Applicant has been married for 13 years (Tr. 29). He has three children, ages 
nine, 11 and 14 (Tr. 29). The two youngest children live with Applicant and his spouse 
(Tr. 30). He pays child support for his eldest child (Tr. 30). He separated from his 
spouse from 2001 to 2003 (Tr. 22, 69). The Army deployed him to Iraq from March 2003 
to August 2003 (Tr. 22). The Army returned him early from Iraq because he had a 
medical problem (Tr. 22). In 2001 to 2003, creditors repossessed two of the family cars, 
and some other bills fell behind because Applicant and his spouse were disputing who 
should pay their debts (Tr. 22, 47). In August 2004, he received a medical retirement 
from the Army (Tr. 22, 32). He received $39,000 in medical severance pay (Tr. 119). 
After leaving active duty, he was unemployed for about two months (Tr. 23, 102). He 
received unemployment compensation of $224 a week (Tr. 32, 102).  
 
Applicant’s wife was in the Army for ten years (Tr. 120). In 2004, she left active 
duty as a sergeant (E-5)(Tr. 120). She was handling the family bills and debts. She has 
been employed with a federal government agency since 2004 (Tr. 119). She has about 
$10,000 in her 401K account (Tr. 92; GE 2 at 7). She has about three credit cards (Tr. 
95). 
 
Summary of SOR debts 
 
Applicant disclosed his delinquent SOR debts on his March 5, 2007, SF-86 (Tr. 
105; GE 1). He obtained a credit report before he completed his SF-86 to ensure he 
provided accurate information to the government (Tr. 105). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,705)—Payment Plan. In March 2006, Applicant began making 
payments and in 2007, he increased the amount of his monthly payment to $350 (Tr. 
38-39). On April 2, 2009, the creditor wrote that Applicant owes $5,373, and the creditor 
had received $6,972 in payments (AE A). On July 8, 2009, the creditor said the balance 
owed is $4,356, and the creditor had received $8,021 in payments (AE J). He plans to 
continue making payments on this debt (Tr. 35-41).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b ($485)—Paid. The debt was owed to a landlord for breaking a lease 
(Tr. 48). On March 23, 2009, the creditor provided a letter indicating Applicant settled 
this debt ($1,684) for $1,348 and paid it (Tr. 49-55; AE B). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c ($7,018)—Paid. On May 19, 2009, Applicant paid $6,157, resolving 
this debt (Tr. 57-61; AE C). He used his income tax refund from 2008 to pay this debt 
(Tr. 57). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d ($291)—Paid. On May 18, 2009, Applicant settled and paid this credit 
card debt (Tr. 62-66; AE D).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e ($9,987)—Payment Plan. Applicant’s wife’s car payment was $554 a 
month (Tr. 69). It was repossessed in 2002 (Tr. 68).  His wife said she made sporadic 
payments in 2005 and 2006 (Tr. 67-68). Applicant and his spouse currently owe the 
creditor $10,608 (AE K). They have a payment arrangement for $295 a month for three 
years, starting on July 24, 2009 (AE K).

In addition to the SOR debts, a judgment was obtained for $1,016 on a dental 
debt (Tr. 71). He thought his wife’s dental insurance was going to pay the debt (Tr. 73). 
In November 2008, they started making payments (Tr. 74), and in July 2009, Applicant 
paid the last $100 on this judgment (Tr. 71-77).  
  
Applicant’s monthly gross salary is about $6,000 (Tr. 77). He changed jobs 
several times in the last five years (Tr. 98-102). His annual salary has varied from about 
$35,000 to about $72,000 (Tr. 98-102). His current net monthly salary is about $4,600 
(Tr. 78). His spouse’s net take home pay is about $3,500 (Tr. 78). His monthly 
expenses are: groceries ($300); clothing ($100); utilities ($400); telephone ($100); car 
expenses ($220); car payment ($630); mortgage ($2,417); medical expenses ($50); 
child support ($300); jewelry credit card ($40); and miscellaneous ($100) (Tr. 78-86, 
107; GE 2 at 7). His budget listed monthly payments to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a 
(monthly payment: $350), the judgment for the dental bill (monthly payment: $200), and 
two small charge card debts, totaling about $2,400 (monthly payment: $104) (Tr. 87-90; 
GE 2 at 7). He has about $3,800 monthly left after paying his expenses (Tr. 90-91). He 
has about $1,100 in checking and savings (Tr. 92).  
 
On July 16, 2009, Applicant and his spouse received financial counseling (AE L-
M). On July 21, 2009, they completed a detailed budget (AE N). The total of all credit 
card debt is $4,656 (AE N). This includes six credit cards, and the minimum total 
payment for the six accounts is $156 (AE N). The monthly remainder after paying debts 
(including payments on two remaining SOR debts) and all expenses is $863 (AE N). 
 
Applicant’s DD Form 214 shows: Army Achievement Medal (2nd Award); Army 
Superior Unit Award; Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal; Army Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award); National Defense 
Service Medal (2nd Award); Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; Armed Forces Service 
Medal; Noncommissioned Officer’s Professional Development Ribbon; Army Service 
Ribbon; Overseas Service Ribbon (2nd Award); United Nations Medal; and NATO Medal 
(AE F). His DD Form 214 notes his service in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi 
Freedom from March 2003 to August 2003 as well as completion of various military 
courses and training (AE F).   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
concerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the 
Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are 
of security concern.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his SF-
86, his SOR response and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his 
creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions 
in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions 
is required. 
  
   Five conditions under AG ¶ 20 may mitigate security concerns and are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his 
delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” I 
am convinced that he will continue with his two payment plans and resolve all of his 
SOR debts. His SOR debts do not “cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment.”  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of separation from his spouse from 2001 to 2003, some brief 
unemployment in 2004, and occasional underemployment after leaving active duty.2 He 
does not receive full mitigating credit because he had sufficient information about 
several delinquent debts and failed to maintain contact with his creditors. He did not 
establish that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address his delinquent 
debts after he learned of their existence.     
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. There are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He understands what 
he must do to maintain financial responsibility. He paid three debts and the other two 
are in payment plans. He has also established partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) 
because he showed some, recent good faith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts. 
Applicant did not contest the validity of any debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His SOR lists five debts totaling about $24,500. 
He paid three debts, and the other two are in payment plans. He made sufficient 
progress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security concerns. I am confident he will 
continue to comply with his payment plans until all of his SOR debts are resolved4 
because of his substantial progress on SOR debt resolution.    
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
   There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s financial conduct. When 
he became separated from his spouse, he should have been more aggressive in his 
efforts to ensure he and his spouse paid their debts. In February 2009, he received the 
SOR. He did not actively and aggressively investigate and pay one of the debts listed 
on his SOR. These factors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. 
His history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security 
violation(s). He is a law-abiding citizen. His current financial problems were caused by 
 
4 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and 
establishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of 
documentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is 
conditional.

some factors partially or fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income; (2) separation 
from his spouse; and (3) underemployment. His SOR listed five debts totaling about 
$24,500. He paid three SOR debts, and the other two are in payment plans. He paid 
$8,021 into one payment plan, and still owes $4,356. The other payment plan starts in 
July 2009. He made sufficient progress resolving his SOR debts to mitigate security 
concerns. His other debts, such as his mortgage, car payment, and six credit cards are 
current. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, 
demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He has completed two 
years of college. He served on active duty in the Army for 11 years, and received an 
honorable discharge. He served in Iraq in 2003. His employment history and 
contributions to a defense contractor speak well for his character. He received financial 
counseling and understands how to budget and what he needs to do to maintain his 
financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism, and 
trustworthiness through his service to the Army in war and peace and as an employee 
of a defense contractor.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative

Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has fully mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
