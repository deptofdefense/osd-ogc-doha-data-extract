HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. He has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment. He paid nine of 14 
statement of reason (SOR) debts. His two student loan debts were merged. Three of 
the remaining debts are in payment plans, and Applicant is negotiating a payment plan 
for his student loan debt. He credibly promised to pay the four unpaid SOR debts and 
one large state tax debt. Access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 20, 2008, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for 
its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, 
citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was 
taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On December 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed 
on March 6, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. On March 20 and 
April 7, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices. The hearing was held on April 22, 2009. At 
the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), 
and Applicant offered 26 exhibits (Tr. 29; AE A-Z). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GEs 1-7 (Tr. 18-19), and AE A-Z (Tr. 30). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, 
response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April 
29, 2009.   
 
SOR Amendment 
 
Department Counsel made a motion to amend the SOR, asking for deletion of 
parenthetical citations to documents supporting the allegations (Tr. 14-15). Applicant did 
not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 15). 
    
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged his 
unsecured debts in 1998 (GE 11). He also admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c to 1.f, 
1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m (GE 11). He denied the remaining debts. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 38 years old (Tr. 58). He formed a small corporation in May 2008, 
which obtained a contract with a government contractor in July 2008 (Tr. 62, 63). 
Applicant is the only employee of his corporation (Tr. 62). He provides services in the 
field of information technology (Tr. 61-62). His corporation receives $85 per hour, and 
he works 40 hours per week (Tr. 63). Prior to starting his own corporation, he earned 
about $85,000 each year for the previous two years working for a different government 
contractor (Tr. 64, 158-159; AE C).  
 
Applicant served in the U.S. Marines from September 1989 to March 1997 (Tr. 
59, 135). When he left active duty he was a Sergeant (E-5) (Tr. 59). He served in Saudi 
Arabia during the first Gulf War (Tr. 60). He received the National Defense Service 
Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Kuwait Liberation Medal, Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbon with one Oak Leaf Cluster (OLC), Navy Unit Commendation Medal, Good 
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

Conduct Medal with one OLC, Southwest Asia Service Medal with three OLCs, and 
Kuwait Liberation Medal (AE A). He completed various education and training courses 
(AE A). He received an Honorable Discharge from the Marine Corps (AE A). He had a 
security clearance while he was on active duty.  
 
In 1998, Applicant completed two years of college and a nine-month program at 
a university, earning a certificate for computer information systems (Tr. 60-61). After 
leaving active duty, he worked for government contractors and received a Top Secret 
clearance (Tr. 65). He has held a clearance for about 20 years, including access to 
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Tr. 65, 134). He seeks retention of his Top 
Secret clearance (Tr. 134).  
 
 Applicant married in 1993 and his divorce was final in January 2008 (Tr. 67). He 
paid his attorney fees relating to his divorce, which were approximately $8,000 (Tr. 75). 
His two children are ages 8 and 12 (Tr. 68). Applicant and his spouse were separated in 
June or July 2006 (Tr. 67). His spouse had an extra-marital affair and became pregnant 
with another man’s baby (Tr. 67, 68). He discovered the baby was not his using a blood 
test after the baby was born (Tr. 68). Applicant received sole custody of his children, 
and is not required to pay child support or alimony (Tr. 69). His former spouse is 
supposed to pay Applicant $1,233 monthly, and she currently owes Applicant about 
$17,000 in back child support (Tr. 72-74; GE 7 at 10-12, 36, 40; AE D). Applicant is a 
single parent; however, his niece who is a senior in high school lives in Applicant’s 
home and provides some child care assistance (Tr. 69-70). 
  
Financial Considerations 
 
On June 6, 2008, Applicant disclosed his financial problems on his 2008 SF 86, 
noting he had delinquent debts, liens, judgments and tax problems (GE 1). He noted on 
the SF 86 that he learned about some debts during the process of obtaining a divorce, 
and he was working with the IRS on developing a repayment plan (GE 1 at 9). He 
promised to generate repayment plans for all of his delinquent debts (GE 1 at 9).  
 
The SOR lists a 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 87, 135) and 14 delinquent 
debts, totaling $76,216 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.o; AE 10). Two debts are consolidated into his 
education debt, nine debts were paid, three debts are in payment plans, and one 
payment plan for his education debt is under negotiation.  
 
Applicant and his wife’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy was caused when his wife became 
unemployed (Tr. 88). Just prior to his bankruptcy filing, Applicant was making about 
$33,000 annually and his spouse was making $44,000 annually (Tr. 88). The loss of his 
spouse’s income resulted in delinquent debts, which were eventually discharged using 
the 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 88, 135).  
 
After the bankruptcy, Applicant fell behind on his debts when his former spouse 
failed to pay their mortgage, student loans, car payments and taxes (Tr. 80). After she 
moved out of their home, he received phone calls or correspondence and discovered 
 
 
4 
 
numerous debts (Tr. 81). He also found old, unpaid bills tucked “in a bin” (Tr. 81). The 
source, status, and amount of his individual SOR debts are more specifically described 
as follows: 
  
(1) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,945) is a judgment. It was paid on November 14, 
2003 (Tr. 114-115; Ex. N).  
 
(2) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($17,468) is a federal tax lien. This debt is in a 
payment plan. Beginning in August 2008, and continuing on a monthly basis thereafter, 
he pays the IRS $3,093 monthly (Tr. 102, 103; AE I, J). More details about a much 
larger federal tax debt and his repayment plan follow on pages 5-6 of this decision. 
 
(3) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($206) is a medical debt. This debt is paid (Tr. 115; Ex. 
O). 
 
(4) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,855) is a collection account from a credit bill. This 
debt is paid (Tr. 115-116; Ex. P). 
 
(5) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($10,825) is a student loan. He was paying $175 
monthly until July of 2008 (Tr. 118-119, 164). He stopped making payments after being 
informed the accounts were being consolidated and transferred (Tr. 119). He was also 
under some financial stress because he was paying about $1,000 monthly for child care 
(Tr. 164). Four student loans totaling about $26,000 were consolidated and transferred 
to a new collection company (Tr. 118). His most recent correspondence with the new 
collection company is dated March 31, 2009 (Tr. 118). This debt is in the process of 
being placed into a payment plan, and his payments will be about $250 per month (Tr. 
116-120, 163-164; Ex. Q, R). 
 
(6) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($321) is a telecommunications account. This debt 
was paid on October 7, 2008 (Tr. 120-121; Ex. S). 
 
(7) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($428) is a collection account. This debt was paid on 
February 26, 2009 (Tr. 121-122; Ex. T). 
 
(8) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($3,391) is an automobile loan. This debt is in a 
payment plan with the first $400 payment being made on April 6, 2009 (Tr. 122-124, 
165-166; Ex. U). The creditor advised him that after three monthly payments are made, 
a settlement for the balance owed is possible (Tr. 122).    
 
(9) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($633) is a judgment from a homeowner’s association. 
This debt was paid on January 11, 2006 (Tr. 124-125; Ex. V). 
 
(10) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($949) is a collection account. This debt is part of the 
student loan consolidation discussed above in SOR ¶ 1.f (Tr. 125-126). 
 
 
 
5 
 
(11) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($4,131) is a home mortgage loan account. Applicant 
purchased a home in 2002 for $415,000 (Tr. 75-76). He is currently about $5,000 
behind on his mortgage (Tr. 76). He has made arrangements to pay his monthly 
payment plus some extra through a direct, automatic payment from his checking 
account (Tr. 76, 126; AE E). His next payment will be $3,700 on April 22, 2009 (Tr. 77, 
166). The mortgage balance is now $419,000 and his current monthly payments are 
$3,064 (Tr. 78; AE W). He is working with the mortgage company to reduce the monthly 
payments, possibly by lowering the interest rate and adding onto the principal of the 
loan (Tr. 77-78, 127). On a previous occasion, Applicant’s former spouse failed to make 
their mortgage payments (Tr. 79-80). In August 2008, Applicant and his former spouse 
signed a quitclaim deed and attempted to end their mortgage payments (Tr. 82; GE 7 at 
13-15). Applicant received estimates on the sale price ranging from $430,000 to 
$460,000; however, he decided not to list the house for sale because he wanted his 
children to have more stability and he thought the value of the house would increase 
(Tr. 83-85; GE 7 at 9; GE F). He rents out the basement for $1,000 per month (Tr. 86-
87; AE G).  
 
(12) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($589) is a bank loan. This debt was paid on 
December 11, 2008 (Ex. W). 
 
(13) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($32,518) is a truck loan account. The truck was sold 
at auction, and the remaining balance owed on the debt was paid on January 7, 2006 
(Tr. 127-128, 165; Ex. X). 
 
(14) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($957) is a credit union account. This debt was paid 
on March 10, 2009 (Tr. 128-129; Ex. Y).  
 
Applicant’s spouse had difficulty retaining employment (Tr. 91). She was fired 
several times (Tr. 91). In 1999, Applicant started his own information technology, 
Subchapter S Corporation (Tr. 91-92). Applicant was the Chief Executive Officer, and 
his wife was the Corporate Financial Officer and Office Manager (Tr. 92). At most, the 
corporation employed four employees (Tr. 92). Applicant thought a payroll service was 
paying the employees and sending payments to the government for taxes (Tr. 94, 141-
144). Applicant’s wife was responsible for completing the tax documents (Tr. 95). 
Applicant signed tax documents for a joint income tax filing, and provided them to his 
former spouse; however, they apparently were not filed (Tr. 150-153, 171-173). 
 
Sometime around 2003 to 2005, Applicant discovered the payroll service was not 
paying the corporation’s taxes (Tr. 96, 138). When he confronted his wife about the 
taxes, she acted like she did not know anything was wrong or inappropriate (Tr. 97). He 
wanted to file tax returns; however, his wife would not sign them as joint filings (Tr. 98-
99, 172). Around 2005, he contacted the IRS about the tax problem (Tr. 144). In April 
2007, Applicant filed the missing tax returns for tax years 2000 to 2007, using married 
filing separate status (Tr. 98-99, 103, 146-150, 172; AE J). He paid a CPA about $1,500 
to file the returns (Tr. 105). He reached an agreement with the IRS and is making 
payments on his back taxes (Tr. 97). He initially paid $2,000 to a company to work with 
 
 
6 
 
the IRS on his behalf (Tr. 101; AE Z), and then he paid the company $600 monthly 
thereafter (Tr. 104). Eventually he paid the company about $12,000 (Tr. 101; AE Z). The 
SOR indicates Applicant owes the IRS $17,468 (SOR ¶ 1.c); however, he actually owes 
the IRS about $275,000 (Tr. 102). He believes the $275,000 IRS debt encompasses 
both his personal (social security, federal income, and Medicare) liability as well as the 
business’ liability (Tr. 175-177). He began making monthly payments beginning in 
August 2008 of $3,093 to the IRS (Tr. 102, 103, 146-150; AE I, J). He believed that 
once he had established a track record of good faith repayment the IRS would make a 
better arrangement to settle his IRS debt (Tr. 104). He provided a 33-page, IRS-
generated account transcript to corroborate his description of his tax calculations, 
filings, payments, and other efforts to ameliorate his federal tax debt (AE J). 
 
In 2007, Applicant also corrected his state tax returns for 2000 to 2007 when he 
corrected his federal returns (Tr. 154-155). He now owes the state $62,000 for back 
taxes (Tr. 105, 153). He disclosed this debt as part of his response to DOHA 
interrogatories (Tr. 106; GE 7 at 6). In August 2008, he made an initial payment of 
$5,000 and thereafter pays $600 monthly, with his most recent payment being on April 
20, 2009 (Tr. 106-108, 155; AE K).  
 
Applicant’s former spouse was charged with a felony for writing bad checks in 
2003 or 2004 (Tr. 109). She now has approximately nine pending felonies for fraud-
related crimes (Tr. 109; Ex. L). She has a court date pending on June 10, 2009 (Tr. 
110). 
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS), dated April 6, 2009, shows a 
monthly gross income of $14,000 and monthly current net monthly income of about 
$10,000 (Tr. 169; AE M). His monthly expenses are $1,910 (AE M). His monthly debt 
payments are $6,933 (includes $3,004 monthly for his mortgage, $3,093 monthly for the 
IRS, $600 monthly for his state tax debt, $176 monthly for his student loan, and notes a 
probable monthly payment for his repossessed car debt) (AE M). His remaining monthly 
income after paying expenses and debts is $2,157 (AE M). His only listed assets are his 
cars (AE M). His PFS is unchanged, except he now has the $1,000 additional monthly 
rental income from renting out his basement (Tr. 111-112; AE M). Applicant does not 
currently use a credit card (Tr. 130, 167). He did not borrow the money that he used to 
pay his SOR debts (Tr. 161). His checking and savings accounts are down virtually to a 
zero balance because of his efforts to pay his delinquent debts (Tr. 168). Applicant 
promised to resolve his debts (Tr. 130-131). 
 
Applicant has not taken a vacation in years, and is very frugal (Tr. 112-113). 
Applicant has two older cars (a 1998 and a 2000 model) (Tr. 70). Both of his cars are 
paid off (Tr. 167). His niece, who assists him with his child care responsibilities, drives 
the 2000 model car (Tr. 70).  
 
Applicant does not drink alcohol (Tr. 112-113). He has never been charged with 
or convicted of any felony offense (GE 1). He has never been charged with or convicted 
of any firearms offense, explosives offense, drug offense or alcohol offense (GE 1). His 
 
 
7 
 
SF 86 indicates he has not been arrested, or charged with any misdemeanor offenses 
in the last seven years (GE 1). 
   
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s former wife’s sister (S) has known Applicant since 1993 (Tr. 45, 47). 
Applicant and his wife separated in 2007 (Tr. 47). S sees Applicant at least twice a 
week when they go to church (Tr. 48). S also sees him when they go to each other’s 
houses (Tr. 48). S babysits for Applicant’s children (Tr. 49). S said her sister, Applicant’s 
former wife, was responsible for the problematic family finances (Tr. 50). Applicant is 
frugal with the family finances (Tr. 50). For example, he has not gone on a vacation trip 
for years (Tr. 51). Applicant’s former wife was not paying her share of the family debts 
(Tr. 52-53).  Applicant’s former wife has a 3-year-old son, whose father is not Applicant 
(Tr. 53). Applicant’s former wife drives a late-model Mercedes (Tr. 53). Applicant’s 
former wife has legal problems relating to bad checks, a probation violation and a 
fraudulent real estate transaction (Tr. 54). S was surprised at the depth of her sister’s 
deviousness (Tr. 56). Applicant is honest and very religious (Tr. 54). Applicant is a 
responsible family man, who keeps his promises (Tr. 54, 55).  
 
An Army program manager and senior analyst, who retired from active duty as a 
colonel, has held a top secret clearance with access to SCI for more 25 years (Tr. 33). 
He has known Applicant since 1997 (Tr. 34, 41). He attends Applicant’s church, has 
served on church committees with Applicant (Tr. 35). They are social friends (Tr. 35). 
They see each other 2-3 times a week (Tr. 36). He also knows Applicant’s former wife 
and two children (Tr. 36-37). He described Applicant as a role model, who is extremely 
trustworthy and reliable (Tr. 36, 39). Applicant would keep a promise to pay off his debts 
(Tr. 40). Applicant is a very frugal person, who carefully lives within his means (Tr. 38, 
39). For example, Applicant drives a car that is over ten years old (Tr. 38). He 
recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance (Tr. 40-41). He would not give 
anyone a “stronger recommendation” for a clearance than Applicant (Tr. 42).  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
 
 
8 
 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
9 
 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides three Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,” and 
“(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same.” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) 
provides, “Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima 
facie case that Applicant had [ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to 
DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response and at his hearing. Applicant’s 1998 Chapter 
7 bankruptcy, and 14 delinquent debts, totaling $76,216, were listed in the SOR. In 
2007, he discovered he actually owed the IRS $275,000 (probably reduced somewhat 
now due to $3,000 monthly payments) and he owed state taxes of $66,000 (now down 
to about $62,000). He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The 
government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c) and 19(g) and 
further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. 
   
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
 
10 
 
                                           
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b) or 
20(e) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his 
delinquent debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives 
partial credit under AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) because his financial problems initially 
resulted because of his spouse’s unemployment and those debts were resolved through 
bankruptcy in 1998. His subsequent delinquent debts were caused by divorce and his 
spouse’s fraudulent activities. His wife lied to him about filing their tax returns from 2000 
to 2005. He established her misconduct thought divorce documentation and her 
charges. He receives substantial mitigating credit because his delinquent debts 
“occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Because of his 
experience of his spouse betraying his trust, it is unlikely he would trust anyone to pay 
his bills, especially his taxes, without verifying the payment. He established that two 
SOR debts were consolidated into one student loan SOR debt, nine SOR debts were 
paid, three SOR debts are in payment plans, and one payment plan for the SOR 
student loan debt is under negotiation. The resolution of nine of his 14 delinquent SOR 
debts shows he acted responsibly under the circumstances for those nine debts.2 AG ¶ 
20(e) does not apply because he did not dispute any of his SOR debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and 
therefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” for the reasons stated 
in the preceding paragraph. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt 
and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some, but 
not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed substantial good faith3 in the 
resolution of his SOR debts.    
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                            
Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts sooner to 
resolve his delinquent debts. His actions to date are insufficient to fully apply any of the 
mitigating conditions. However, security concerns are fully mitigated under the “Whole 
Person Concept,” infra at pages 11-13.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. About eleven years 
ago, several of Applicant’s debts became delinquent because more than half of the 
family income was lost when his spouse became unemployed. His debts were resolved 
through his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998. Applicant and his spouse subsequently 
generated 14 delinquent SOR debts, totaling $76,216. He admitted responsibility for the 
bankruptcy and all of the delinquent SOR debts. In 2007, he discovered he actually 
owed the IRS $275,000 and he owed state taxes of $66,000. He discovered his wife had 
not filed their federal and state tax returns from 2000 to 2005. He failed to obtain 
financial counselling. He showed some effort over the years to resolve his delinquent 
debts, but could have acted more aggressively to avoid delinquent debt, to seek debt 
 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

repayment or resolution, and to better document his remedial efforts. These factors 
show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt 
and failure to file and pay taxes raises sufficient security concerns to merit further 
inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current 
financial problems were caused by three factors beyond his control: (1) his divorce, (2) 
the necessity to support his two children as a single father, and (3) most importantly, he 
was a victim of his spouse’s fraudulent actions. Applicant’s spouse was handling their 
debt payments and she did not pay their debts. Even though he signed his tax returns, 
she did not file them or pay their taxes from 2000 to 2005. Applicant discovered his 
spouse was engaged in an adulterous affair, and filed for divorce. The family court 
granted Applicant custody and ordered her to pay child support. Applicant’s former 
spouse was subsequently charged with a felony for writing bad checks in 2003 or 2004. 
She now has approximately nine pending felonies for fraud-related crimes. Ultimately, 
he paid or settled and paid all delinquent accounts except for four debts and his non-
SOR state tax debt. He provided receipts showing that all except four of his delinquent 
SOR debts and his non-SOR state tax debt were resolved through payment of his 
creditors.  
 
The IRS and state authorities seem to be satisfied with Applicant’s payment plan 
of about $3,600 per month (since August 2008). He stopped paying his student loan 
while it was being consolidated; however, he has maintained communications with the 
creditor and promised to make the likely payments of about $250 per month as soon as 
the creditor is prepared to accept payments. He started making payments on a debt of 
about $4,000 that he owed for a repossessed vehicle. He worked diligently since 2007 
to pay his delinquent federal and state taxes. He has ample income to pay his debts. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
 
 
13 
 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant is 38 years old. He has achieved some important educational and 
employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He 
has held a security clearance for about 20 years. He defended his country in peace and 
war as a U.S. Marine and then supported the Department of Defense as a contractor. 
He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial 
responsibility. Years ago, he made mistakes, and his debts became delinquent. His 
primary mistake was to trust his spouse, when there were signs during their marriage 
that her honesty and integrity were suspect. He compounded those mistakes by failing 
to act more aggressively to resolve his debts especially his state and federal tax 
problems. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt payments by actually paying all except 
four of his SOR delinquent debts and a substantial delinquent non-SOR state tax debt. 
Most importantly, he is paying his mortgage, his federal tax debt, his state tax debt, one 
car loan and will soon continue making payments on his student loan. He credibly 
promised to continue with payments on his debts. I found his statement to be candid, 
forthright and credible. These factors, especially his past government service, show 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  
 
Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through 
his service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and to the U.S. Marines. After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.o:  For Applicant 
 
 
 
14 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
