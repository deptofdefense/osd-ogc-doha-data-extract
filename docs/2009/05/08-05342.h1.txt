FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), based on 50 delinquent debts reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau 
reports. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on October 12, 2007. On 
December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on 
December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 2, 2009; answered it on the same day; and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on 
March 3, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 17, 2009, and the 
case was assigned to me on March 19, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on 
March 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified but submitted no documentary evidence. I kept the record 
open until May 6, 2009, to enable him to submit evidence. DOHA received the transcript 
on April 28, 2009. Applicant timely submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A, which was 
admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s response to AX A is attached to the 
record as Hearing Exhibit I. The record closed on May 6, 2009.  
 
Procedural Issue 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant stated he was unaware of his right to be represented by 
a lawyer or personal representative (Tr. 4-5). The previously-assigned Department 
Counsel sent the “discovery packet” containing GX 1 through 4 to Applicant on March 
16, 2009. The cover letter explained to Applicant that he was entitled to retain an 
attorney or obtain the help of a personal representative, but it was sent to his former 
address (HX II). Applicant stated he never received the packet (Tr. 22).  
 
The currently-assigned Department Counsel determined on March 26, 2009, that 
Applicant had moved to another address (HX III). A discovery packet was never sent to 
Applicant’s new address and apparently was not forwarded from his previous address 
(Tr. 23).  
 
The notice of hearing sent to Applicant and his employer included a 
memorandum entitled, “Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance 
(ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings.” This memorandum also advised 
the recipient of the right to be represented by an attorney or personal representative 
(HX IV). Applicant received the hearing notice, but he stated he did not remember 
seeing the memorandum attached to the notice (Tr. 20). I conclude that he received the 
memorandum attached to the hearing notice but paid no attention to it.  
 
 I asked Applicant if he would have hired a lawyer if he knew he was entitled to 
one, and he responded in the negative, stating he could not afford a lawyer. I asked him 
if he was willing to continue the hearing while representing himself, and he responded in 
the affirmative (Tr. 24). Based on Applicant’s statement that he would not have hired a 
lawyer even if he had been aware of his right to do so, and his affirmative statement that 
he desired to continue the hearing and represent himself, I conducted the hearing as 
scheduled. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 
1.d, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, 1.x, 1.cc, 1.dd, 1.ee, 1.gg, 1.rr, and 1.ss. He did 
 
3 
 
 
not address the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e, 1.n and 1.bb in his answer. At the 
hearing, he admitted the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.p, and 1.t. His 
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is a 36-year-old shipping and receiving clerk employed by a defense 
contractor. He began working as a temporary employee in October 2007, and he 
became a permanent employee on November 1, 2007. He has an interim clearance, but 
he has never held a final clearance (Tr. 5, 32-33).  
 
 Applicant is unmarried and has no children (Tr. 31). He has a high school 
education and has taken some college courses (Tr. 5).  
 
 Applicant testified the delinquent rent alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a occurred when he 
stopped paying rent because his landlord refused to make repairs to the apartment (Tr. 
35-36). His landlord obtained a judgment against him, which is unsatisfied. 
 
 The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d were delinquent rent payments. They were 
satisfied by garnishment (Tr. 36-37; AX A). 
 
 The bad checks alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.k-1.o, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.gg, and the 
overdraft charges alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p and 1.t arose when Applicant’s checking 
account was overdrawn. He testified he believed the bad check alleged in ¶ 1.gg was 
paid, but he could not produce any documentation of payment. He knew the checks had 
been dishonored, but he did nothing because no one contacted him about them. 
 
 Applicant testified his delinquent medical bills (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.y-
1.aa, 1.ii, 1.mm-1.pp, 1.tt-1.vv, and 1.xx) arose when he had a pacemaker implanted in 
December 2003 (Tr. 64). His medical insurance carrier changed from the time he had 
the implant until he was released from the hospital, and each carrier insisted that the 
other carrier was responsible for the medical bills (Tr. 29-30). He testified his father has 
made inquiries with the insurance companies, but Applicant has not filed disputes with 
the credit bureaus or had any contact with the insurance companies or medical 
providers (Tr. 59). 
 
 Applicant denied the delinquent cable bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.w, testifying it was 
his father’s account. He and his father have the same name. He called the cable 
company, and was informed there was no account with his social security number, but 
he has not filed a dispute with the credit bureau (Tr. 48-49). He produced no written 
documentation regarding this account. 
 
 Applicant testified he believed the delinquent debt for satellite television service 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.x was paid, but he was unable to produce any documentation (Tr. 
49-50). He testified his video store account referred to in SOR ¶ 1.hh was current, but 
he was unable to produce documentation (Tr. 54-55). He denied the debt for an 
unreturned video alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ww, but he produced no evidence concerning the 
status of his account with the video store (Tr. 56). 
 
4 
 
 
 Applicant neither admitted nor denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.bb. He 
testified he believed it was for furniture, but he was unable to produce any evidence it 
was resolved (Tr. 51).  
 
 Applicant admitted that the three delinquent cell phone debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.cc-1.ee were unpaid. He testified he believed the cell phone debt alleged in ¶ 1.jj 
duplicates the debt alleged in ¶ 1.ee (Tr. 55). 
 
 Applicant denied the collection accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.ff and 1.qq, and the 
two restaurant debts alleged in 1.kk and 1.ll, and they remain unresolved. He admitted 
the collection account debt in SOR ¶ 1.rr, and it is unpaid. The tuition bill alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.ss has been paid (GX 3 at 5).  
 
 In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial 
statement (PFS) on July 30, 2008 (GX 2 at 8). His PFS reflects net monthly income of 
$1,884, expenses of $1,312, and a debt payment of $185, and monthly remainder of 
$4,126. The remainder is miscalculated; it should be $387.

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
 
6 
 
 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges 50 delinquent debts. Applicant established that four debts were 
paid (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and 1.ss). He admitted 18 debts in his answer to the SOR and two 
additional debts at the hearing. 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 The potentially disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 19(a) is raised by an “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts.” AG ¶ 19(c) is raised by “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” Applicant’s financial history raises these two disqualifying conditions, 
shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ 
E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
 The evidence indicates that the delinquent cell phone debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.jj 
duplicates the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.ee. When the same conduct is alleged twice in 
the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be 
resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 
3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.jj in his 
favor. 
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). Applicant’s debts are 
recent and frequent. With the exception of the medical bills, they did not occur under 
unusual circumstances unlikely to recur. His inaction regarding his numerous delinquent 
debts casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I 
conclude AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that ‘the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
 
8 
 
 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant’s medical problems requiring a 
pacemaker implant were beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly to resolve 
the debts that were incurred. While some of the debts should have been covered by his 
medical insurance, many of the medical bills are for small amounts consistent with 
copayments or deductibles. He has relied on his father to make inquiries and has taken 
virtually no personal action to resolve the debts he believes should be covered by 
insurance. I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence Applicant has 
sought or received counseling, and his financial problems are not under control.  
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition is established for 
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and 1.ss, but not for the remaining debts. 
 
Finally, security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing 
“the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). 
Applicant testified the delinquent cable bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.w was his father’s debt, 
but he provided no documentation that his father was the account holder, and he has 
taken no action to have the debt deleted from his credit history. I conclude AG ¶ 20(e) is 
not established. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
9 
 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature adult. He was articulate and candid at the hearing. He was 
aware of his bad checks and medical bills before he applied for a clearance. His neglect 
of his financial situation raises doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Directive ¶ E3.1.25: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.ii:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.jj:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.kk-1.rr:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.ss:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.tt-1.xx:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
