Decision 
______________ 
 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding criminal conduct, 
alcohol consumption, and personal conduct.  Eligibility for a security clearance and 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 5, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), G (Alcohol Consumption), and E (Personal Conduct), 
and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 18, 2008. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated September 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and 
the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch on December 5, 2008. 
It was reassigned to me on February 6, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on March 6, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
March 26, 2009. 
 
During the hearing, nine Government exhibits and four Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) was received on April 3, 2009. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
At the conclusion of Applicant’s case, Department Counsel moved to amend the 
SOR to conform to the evidence presented.  Specifically, she moved to withdraw SOR & 
3.d. There being no objection, the motion was granted.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to Criminal Conduct in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g. through 1.k., and 
1.m. through 1.w.).  He denied the remaining allegations, as well as all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct.  
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. He has been 
gainfully employed by the same defense contractor since January 2005, and currently 
serves as a modular radio systems engineer.2 His employment history since 1997 
includes a variety of positions with different employers, both as an employee and as 
either an intern or a member of a student Co-op. Before that, during the 1980s and early

1990s, he held different positions in the construction industry, working with iron workers, 
glazers, and pipe layers.3 Applicant earned a B.S.E.E. in December 2002 and an 
M.S.E.E. in May 2005.4  He is a member of Mensa, an international high-IQ society.5 
He has never served in the U.S. military.6 He was married to his first wife from August 
1990 until December 2004, and was married to his second wife from December 20047 
until 2008.8 He has one daughter, born in 20 9
 
Applicant described his lifestyle during his time with the construction industry, as 
follows:10 
 
I would say it was more of a cavalier lifestyle that lacked focus for long-
term ambitions and dreams.  Just living for the day versus following my 
dreams and just mapping a course to complete the degree that I had 
chosen in electronics engineering. 
 
In discussing his feeling toward authority during that period, he stated:11 
 
It was perhaps a cavalier attitude. Not one of contempt but not holding it in 
I guess, utmost respect and or even the proper fear thereof. 
 
Criminal Conduct & Alcohol Consumption  
 
Applicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice have been 
alcohol and cocaine. Over the years, from about 1980 until about 2005, Applicant was 
involved in numerous incidents with law enforcement authorities. Some of those 
incidents involved alcohol or cocaine, and others did not. Likewise, in some of those 
incidents, Applicant correctly identified himself to the authorities, and in some others, he 
used various aliases. His Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record 
indicates his use of 23 variations of his name or other false identities, 10 different social 
security numbers, and 6 different dates of birth.12 The SOR alleges 23 incidents, but 
there are other non-alleged incidents as well:

battery.38 Applicant does not recall if he was ever convicted of the charge, but 
speculates it was dismissed,39 and there is no evidence to indicate the actual 
disposition. 
 
SOR & 1.l.: On December 14, 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
theft over $300.40 He admitted the arrest but disputed the characterization of the

He had spent the day “tubing” down the river and had consumed an unspecified 
quantity of beer before driving home and being stopped for speeding.44 He was

entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to a fine and his operator’s license was 
suspended.45 
 
SOR & 1.j.: On March 2, 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
possession of a narcotic drug – felony.46 The substance in question was cocaine.47

at the time of his arrest.48 He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to 18 months 
confinement.49 Applicant only served about 10 months confinement and was released 
on parole and remained in that status for three years.50

SOR & 1.i.: On November 11, 1992, Applicant, using an alias, was arrested and 
charged with one count of assault – misdemeanor, one count of possession of narcotic 
drug – felony, and one count of forgery – felony.51 Prior to the arrest, Applicant and his 
first wife were drinking beer and using cocaine, and someone had complained to the 
police about a loud stereo.52 While he was being processed incident to the arrest, the 
police found the cocaine.53 The charges for assault and forgery were apparently 
dismissed because no complaint was filed.54 The drug charge was amended to 
possession of drug paraphernalia, and Applicant was convicted of that amended charge 
and sentenced to 1-5 years confinement, concurrent with the charge set forth in SOR & 
1.h., below.55  
 
SOR & 1.h.: On April 19, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with one 
count of failure to appear – felony, and three counts of forgery – felonies.56 The forgery 
counts were related to Applicant’s possession of fake operator’s license(s) during a prior 
arrest.57 Two of the forgery charges were dismissed, and the failure to appear charge 
was not pursued by the prosecution, but was amended to solicitation.58 He was 
convicted of one possession of a forged instrument and the amended charge of 
solicitation, and sentenced to prison for 1-5 years, concurrent with the charges set forth 
in SOR & 1.i., above.59  He was released on bail on about August 26, 1993.60 
 
SOR & 1.g.: On August 26, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with one 
count of criminal damage to property – misdemeanor, and one count of trespass – 
felony.61 When Applicant was released on bail from his earlier incarceration, he went 
home to discover another man with his first wife.  While there was no physical violence 
involved, there was arguing and yelling, and when the police arrived, they determined

that Applicant had violated one of the terms of his bail.62 The charges were 
subsequently dismissed.63 
 
SOR & 1.f.: On May 4, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI – 
misdemeanor.64 He admitted the incident but disputed the characterization as a DUI, 
claiming his arrest was on a bench warrant for failure to appear for an earlier charge 
related to his April 19, 2003, use of an alias.65 There is no evidence to indicate he was 
ever convicted of the SOR alleged charge. 
 
SOR & 1.e.: On August 29, 1995, there was an incident at Applicant’s university 
dorm room when three individuals, all under 21 years of age, and Applicant, all of whom 
had been drinking,66 got into an argument.  The police arrived during the scuffle and 
arrested and charged each of the individuals with disorderly conduct.67 The charge was 
subsequently dismissed.68 
 
SOR & 1.d.: On July 12, 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with two 
counts of menacing threats, and one count of resisting arrest.69 The incident started 
when Applicant was serving in a summer internship out of state and he and his 
roommate at the hotel hosted a party for other interns.  Police officers responded to a 
complaint regarding loud music, and Applicant refused to “submit [himself] weakly and 
humbly” to the officers.70 He was subsequently convicted but the sentence has not been 
specified. 71 
 
SOR & 1.c.: On March 31, 2001, while at a heritage gathering, Applicant was 
arrested and charged on outstanding warrants with two counts of false report to law 
enforcement (because he had used a false identity during an earlier arrest), and one 
count of DUI – liquor/drugs/vapors/combo (purportedly stemming from that earlier 
arrest).72 It is not clear what the individual charge dispositions were, but he was

convicted of at least one of the counts and sentenced to a fine and 18 months 
confinement.73 
 
SOR & 1.b.: On October 7, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
disorderly conduct.74 The incident started when Applicant returned to his girlfriend’s 
house, where he had been periodically staying, to retrieve his belongings, and a dispute 
arose over his possessions. The police responded to a call, and when they appeared 
and told Applicant to be quiet, he refused to shut his mouth.75 He spent the night in jail 
and went before the judge the following morning where he was convicted and 
sentenced to time served. 76 
 
SOR & 1.a.: On September 19, 2005, five months after applying for his security 
clearance, Applicant was arrested and charged with one count of DUI – 
liquor/drugs/vapors/combo, and one count of DUI with BAC of .08 or more.77 He was 
eventually convicted of the amended charge of Extreme DUI with BAC of .15 or more, 
the other counts were dismissed, and he was sentenced to a fine and 30 days 
confinement.78 
 
Not alleged in the SOR: On or about December 24, 2007, Applicant was arrested 
and charged with speeding after driving his vehicle 96 miles per hour (mph) in a posted 
75 mph zone.  He paid a substantial fine for that violation.79 
 
Applicant started using alcohol when he worked in construction and consumed 
beer after work with his crew.80 Although he abstained for a few months following his 
2005 DUI, he resumed his consumption of beer with the same frequency, but with a 
diminished quantity.81 In November 2006, he indicated that he drank a couple of beers 
on the weekends, while watching football, and on one other unspecified occasion during 
the week.82 He estimated it would take two or three beers to “put him over the legal 
limit,” and six or seven beers “to make him intoxicated.”83 At the hearing, he stated that

he currently consumes three or four 12 ounce beers during the course of a sporting 
event, on one or two occasions per month.84 He claims the last time he consumed 
alcohol to the point of intoxication was in 2005,85 and there is no evidence to rebut his 
claim. Additionally, since 2005, there is no evidence to indicate that he has attempted to 
drive an automobile while legally impaired. 
 
Applicant’s relationship with cocaine was much more limited.  He contends he 
purchased it on two occasions for his own use in 1992, and used it on three or four 
occasions that same year.86 He claims he last used cocaine in 1992,87 and there is no 
evidence to rebut his claim. 
 
Applicant has never undergone alcohol treatment or counseling,88 nor has he 
ever been evaluated or diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.89 On 
March 13, 2007, he successfully completed 54 hours of alcohol education and 
counseling after being referred to the program by the court.90  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
On February 8, 1999, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
completed Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP).91 The SOR alleges 
Applicant deliberately failed to disclose two aspects of his police record in Section 23 
thereof. The SOR & 3.a. refers to question 23.d. (Have you ever been charged with or 
convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?). There is no express limitation 
to that particular question which would decrease the reportable period to anything less 
than “ever.”92 The SOR & 3.b. refers to question 23.f. (In the last 7 years, have you 
been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to 
a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was 
alcohol or drug related.)). Applicant answered “Yes” to the questions and listed four 
such incidents: a June 1992 forgery conviction, an August 1992 possession of cocaine 
conviction, both of which purportedly resulted in 18 months in jail,93 a May 1991 DUI

conviction for which he was fined,94 and a September 1996 disorderly conduct charge 
which was dismissed.95 It is unclear what he meant by the first two or last entries for 
they do not coincide with any known incidents of those dates. 
 
As noted above, Applicant was arrested on March 2, 1992 (SOR & 1.j.), and 
charged with possession of a narcotic drug – felony. He was convicted of the charge 
and sentenced to 18 months confinement. He was also arrested on April 19, 1993 (SOR 
& 1.h.), and charged with one count of failure to appear – felony, and three counts of 
forgery – felonies. The purported September 1996 incident actually occurred in August 
1995 (SOR & 1.e.). He was convicted of one possession of a forged instrument and the 
amended charge of solicitation, and sentenced to prison for 1-5 years, concurrent with 
other charges as set forth in SOR & 1.i. The May 1991 incident is set forth in SOR & 
1.k. Applicant certified that his responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best 
of his knowledge and belief.96 They were not, for he omitted his July 11, 1998 arrest 
(SOR & 1.d.) for menacing threats and resisting arrest, his May 4, 1994 arrest (SOR & 
1.f.) for DUI, his August 26, 1993 arrest (SOR & 1.g.) for criminal damage and trespass 
– felony, as well as his June 25, 1983 arrest (not alleged in the SOR) for DUI, for which 
he was sentenced to a fine and three years probation. 
 
Applicant attributes his failure to list every incident required by the questions to a 
variety of possibilities which he failed to fully explore or explain. In his answer to SOR 
he raised the possibilities that: (1) he genuinely forgot the arrest, (2) he inadvertently 
overlooked it, (3) he misunderstood the question, (4) he thought the arrest had been 
related to a prior charge and did not need to be reported, and (5) in his haste to submit 
the application he reported all of the more serious incidents.97 Furthermore, it was his 
impression that felonies were the most important issue and he “did not carry over the 
same degree of completeness or thoroughness to [the question dealing with offenses 
dealing with alcohol or drugs].”98 Despite denying a deliberate falsification, he admitted 
deliberately omitting any alcohol or drug incidents in the 1980s because he was 
purportedly under the impression that there was a seven-year time-frame for such 
offenses.99 He intentionally omitted the other arrests of interest either because they 
were based on bench warrants for earlier incidents or they still remained unresolved.100

On April 5, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
completed SF 86.101 The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose one 
aspect of his police record in Section 24 thereof. The SOR & 3.c. refers to question 24: 
(Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or 
drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case 
has been “sealed” or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this 
requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for 
which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 
18 U.S.C. 3607.). There is no express limitation to that particular question which would 
decrease the reportable period to anything less than “ever.”102 Applicant answered 
“Yes” to the question and listed two such incidents: an August 1992 possession of 
cocaine conviction and a May 1991 DUI conviction.103 Applicant certified that his 
responses were ”true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief.104 
They were not, for he omitted his March 31, 2001 arrest (SOR & 1.c.) for two counts of 
false report to law enforcement, and DUI - liquor/drugs/vapors/combo, and his May 4, 
1994 arrest (SOR & 1.f.) for DUI. Once again, Applicant attributes his failure to list every 
incident required by the question to the same variety of possibilities set forth above 
which he failed to fully explore or explain. 
 
Applicant’s testimony during the hearing was replete with “I do not recall” 
responses to inquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the dispositions of 
those arrests, and whether or not he had consumed alcohol prior to the individual 
incidents.  Likewise, when questioned pertaining to a particular incident, he sometimes 
responded by referring to other incidents.  He referred to incidents with the wrong dates. 
He admitted stealing the identity of others.105 When asked what assurances he could 
provide that he would not have future “momentary errors of judgment,” he stated that his 
firm conviction and the fact that he does not repeat prior mistakes would guide his future 
actions.106 
 
According to a person who has known Applicant for 12 years, including their 
undergraduate years, Applicant is “intelligent, capable, and ethical,” as well as “readily 
capable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness, insight, and maturity, always 
using sound judgment in his work and personal areas of responsibility.” He is 
considered organized, efficient, and extremely competent.107

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”108 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon 
a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”109   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”110 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.111  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

110 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.  Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.”112 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”113 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), “a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or 
convicted,@ may raise security concerns. Applicant’s lengthy history of criminal conduct, 
involving over 20 arrests and a substantial number of convictions (along with a number 
of dismissals), is documented in his police and court records, his answers to 
interrogatories, and the evidence, including his testimony, presented during the hearing. 
The Government has established AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(c).   
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
112 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
113 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
15 
                                      
 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.@ In addition, when there is “evidence that the person did not commit the 
offense,” AG ¶ 32(c) may apply. Similarly, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply when “there is 
evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time 
without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher 
education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.@  
 
AG ¶ 32(a) only partially applies in one instance, but not for the remaining 
incidents, for several reasons. Applicant’s history of criminal conduct, as set forth in the 
SOR, commenced in 1980, when he was 23 years old, and continued repeatedly over 
the next 25 years with few significant breaks between incidents. Criminal conduct, 
sometimes only months apart from each other, occurred largely because of Applicant’s 
cavalier attitude towards authority and regulations, including the law. His cursory 
explanation and justification for his conduct that he had a cavalier lifestyle at the time 
provides no mitigation. Moreover, Applicant apparently transformed himself from the old 
construction industry lifestyle to an engineering lifestyle in 1997, and five incidents 
occurred after that. Over an extensive period, arrests and judicial punishment failed to 
stem the tide of his criminal activities. Instead, emboldened by some relatively light fines 
and brief periods of confinement, as well as some dismissals of charges, he added 
identity theft to his misconduct. 
 
The circumstances of Applicant’s criminal conduct were not so unusual that it 
would be unlikely to recur. To the contrary, the circumstances cast substantial doubt as 
to Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. While I might be 
persuaded that one incident which was fully detailed and described during the hearing 
might justify the application of AG ¶ 32(a), Applicant’s inability to explain or describe the 
circumstances of other incidents indicates AG ¶ 32(a) should not apply to the remaining 
incidents. 
 
Applicant has argued that sufficient time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
occurred to support mitigation of such conduct. He contends the last incident occurred 
in October 2001, and that the September 2005 incident was merely a slip or relapse. 
Considering the lengthy period of criminal conduct, the three and one-half years since 
his last SOR-alleged arrest, and the two years since he completed the alcohol 
education and counseling program stemming from that conviction, I believe the time 
elapsed does not yet satisfy the intent of AG ¶ 32(a).  
 
AG ¶ 32(c) partially applies. The SOR alleges a large number of arrests, and in 
some instances, Applicant was convicted on one or more charges. In some instances, 
there is no evidence of a court disposition, and in other instances, the evidence is that 
the charges were dismissed. Moreover, Applicant’s recollection pertaining to many of 
those events was not significant. It is noted that the earlier version of the AG contained 
the mitigating condition for “acquittal,” but that condition was changed to the current 
condition: “evidence that the person did not commit the offense.” I recognize that 
acquittal on the basis of a technicality does not address the substance of the charge 
and should not be the sole basis for mitigation. The revised AG condition mitigates only 
 
16 
                                      
 
on the basis of evidence that the person did not commit the offense. In other words, it 
requires an applicant to prove a negative. The burden of proof is different in the 
courtroom than in the personnel security system herein. However, considering the 
quality of the evidence, while there is evidence of some arrests and some dismissals, 
there is no evidence dispositive of Applicant’s actual commission of the particular 
offenses in issue.  
 
AG ¶ 32(d) does not apply. Applicant argues that there is evidence of substantial 
rehabilitation because he has successfully completed the alcohol education and 
counseling program, has not had any negative incidents during the past three and one-
half years, and has a new lifestyle and respect for the law. There is insufficient evidence 
of successful rehabilitation despite Applicant’s program completion and there being no 
further SOR-alleged criminal conduct. While a person should not be held forever 
accountable for misconduct from the past, without a clear indication of subsequent 
reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty 
the probability that such conduct will not recur in the future.  
 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out 
in AG ¶ 21:  
      
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 22(a), “alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of 
concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or 
alcohol dependent” is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, “habitual or binge consumption 
of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,” may apply under AG ¶ 22(c).  
AG ¶ 22(a) is established by Applicant’s DUI arrests and/or convictions; and AG ¶ 22(c), 
because he habitually consumes alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. 
 
Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI in May 1991, May 1994, March 
2001, and September 2005. The evidence reflects convictions for all but the May 1994 
incident.  As for Applicant’s continued consumption of alcohol to the point of impairment, 
the following evidence is significant. Applicant abstained for a few months following his 
2005 DUI, but resumed his consumption of beer with the same frequency, but with a 
diminished quantity. He estimated it would take two or three beers to “put him over the 
legal limit,” which is .08, and six or seven beers “to make him intoxicated.” He currently 
consumes three or four 12 ounce beers during the course of a sporting event, on one or 
two occasions per month. He claims the last time he consumed alcohol to the point of 
intoxication was in 2005.  By his own admission, if two or three beers put him over the 
 
17 
                                      
 
legal limit, his current consumption of three or four beers, once or twice a month, while 
not sufficient to make him intoxicated, clearly passes the point of impaired judgment. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could potentially mitigate 
security concerns arising from alcohol consumption under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-(d). But in this 
instance, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Furthermore, after careful 
consideration of the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption, I conclude 
Applicant’s continued alcohol consumption to the point of impairment after his DUI 
conviction, and after completion of the alcohol education and counseling program, 
indicate he is unwilling or unable to curtail his alcohol consumption. As such, his 
conduct demonstrates a lack of judgment and/or a failure to control impulses which is 
inconsistent with the holder of a security clearance. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(a), a “deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities,” is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately 
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, 
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government 
representative,” may raise security concerns. Applicant’s omissions of critical 
information pertaining to arrests, provides sufficient evidence to examine if his 
omissions were deliberate falsifications or were the result of simple oversight or 
negligence on his part.  
 
As noted above, Applicant attributes his failure to list every incident required by 
the questions to a variety of possibilities which he failed to fully explore or explain. 
Some of those possibilities are inconsistent with each other, and, except for certain 
instances, he never explicitly selected one particular one to justify his actions. His “I do 
not recall” responses to inquiries regarding the circumstances of his arrests, the 
dispositions of those arrests, and whether or not he had consumed alcohol prior to the 
individual incidents, also are cause for concern. His responses to inquiries during the 
hearing were less than full and complete, and conveyed the impression that he was 
 
18 
                                      
 
                                                          
unconcerned, unprepared to be candid, or deliberately evasive. He also admitted 
stealing the identity of others. 
 
When asked what assurances he could provide that he would not have future 
“momentary errors of judgment,” he stated that his firm conviction and the fact that he 
does not repeat prior mistakes would guide his future actions. There is one problem 
accepting that explanation and that is that Applicant’s history is one violation, one 
arrest, one conviction, one falsification, and one omission after another. 
 
His explanations are at odds with the characterization of him by his character 
witness: Applicant is “readily capable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness, 
insight, and maturity, always using sound judgment in his work and personal areas of 
responsibility.” A person so characterized would not have overlooked the incidents or 
misconstrued the questions. He is clearly very intelligent. I find Applicant’s explanations 
are incredible in his denial of deliberate falsification.114 
 
Furthermore, contrary to Applicant’s contentions, and despite denying deliberate 
falsifications, he admitted deliberately omitting certain incidents in the 1980s because 
he was purportedly under the erroneous impression that there was a seven-year time-
frame for such offenses, and he intentionally omitted other arrests of interest either 
because they were based on bench warrants for earlier incidents or they still remained 
unresolved. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) have been established. 
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct under AG ¶¶ 17(a)-(g). But in this instance, 
none of the mitigating conditions apply.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
114 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission. 
 
19 
                                      
 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines J, G, and E in my analysis below.      
 
As noted above, Applicant’s 25 year history of criminal conduct, as set forth in 
the SOR, commenced in 1980, when he was 23 years old, and continued repeatedly 
over the years with few breaks between incidents. His criminal conduct, according to 
Applicant, occurred largely because of his cavalier attitude towards authority and 
regulations, including the law. Arrests and judicial punishment failed to stem the tide of 
his criminal activities. Instead, he added identity theft to his conduct. He currently 
consumes enough beer to cause him to pass the point of impaired judgment. 
 
His testimony and explanations pertaining to both his criminal conduct and the 
alleged falsifications on his QNSP and SF 86 are at odds with the characterization of 
him by his character witness: “readily capable of handling any situation with 
thoughtfulness, insight, and maturity, always using sound judgment in his work and 
personal areas of responsibility.” A person – a member of Mensa – so characterized 
would not have overlooked the incidents or misconstrued the questions. To the contrary, 
his testimony, including his flawed memory and explanations, as well as his continued 
alcohol consumption, establishes irresponsibility, immaturity, a cavalier attitude towards 
the law, and absence of rehabilitation and true remorse. Taken together, his conduct 
over the years vitiates any other mitigation. (See AG && 2(a)1, 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)4, 
2(a)(5), 2(a)(6), 2(a)(7), and 2(a)(9).) 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct, 
alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
