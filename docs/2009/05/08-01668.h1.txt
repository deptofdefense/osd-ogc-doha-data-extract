HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has three unresolved past due obligations totaling in excess of 
$36,000. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government’s security concerns 
under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case

 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order 
and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 19, 2008, detailing security concerns under 
financial considerations. 
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

 On December 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. 
On February 12, 2009, I was assigned the case. On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on March 18, 2009.  
 
 The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into 
evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, 
which were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional 
information from Applicant. On March 25, 2009, additional material was submitted. 
Department Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the 
record as Ex. G. On March 31, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR ¶ ¶ 
1.d, 1.f, 1.g. and 1.l. He admitted the remaining factual allegations. He provided an 
additional document to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old senior price analyst who has worked for a defense 
contractor since October 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. 
Applicant’s co-workers, colleagues, supervisors, acquaintances, and friends state: 
Applicant is a man of genuine character and integrity, trustworthy, honest, talented, 
energetic, hardworking, enthusiastic, dedicated, a determined and courteous 
professional, with a strong moral character and strong work ethic. (Ex. A)  
 
Applicant asserts he had no financial problems until January 2000 when he 
moved from California to a new state. He had been given the option by his employer of 
being laid off or moving to a company location in the new state. When he moved, he 
intended the move would be temporary until he could find another job and relocate back 
to California. His alternate plan was to have his family relocate to his new location. 
Applicant’s daughter had a congenital heart condition. (Tr. 30) The first day at his new 
location his daughter was hospitalized and he had to rush back to California. Applicant 
was unable to find a job in California and his wife refused to relocate to his new location.  
 
Applicant exhausted his 401(k) retirement plan funds attempting to maintain 
homes in both locations. (Ex. 3) Use of his retirement funds resulted in tax liability. 
Additionally, the relocation money received from his company for his move was also 
taxable. (Tr. 31) A tax liability for tax years 2000 and 2001 was incurred. (Tr. 31) A tax 
lien was placed on his property. Starting in 2003, Applicant made offers in compromise 
to the IRS. (Ex. 3) Applicant was unsuccessful in his attempt to negotiate a settlement 
with the IRS. The IRS demanded $5,000 and $500 per month, which Applicant was 
unable to pay.  
 
In June 2008, the IRS intercepted Applicant’s $900 tax refund and applied it to 
his tax debt leaving a balance of $29,891 in past due taxes for tax year 2001. (Answer 
to SOR, Ex. 3) Applicant is not currently making payment to the IRS. (Tr. 44) The SOR 
alleges three tax liens which total $61,580. In March 2009, Applicant submitted an IRS 
 
 
 
3
Form 911, Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance. No settlement has been 
reached with the IRS. 
 
In November 2002, Applicant’s separation from his family ended in a divorce. 
(Ex. 3) He was required to pay $1,408 monthly child support for his three children. (Ex. 
C) Applicant got behind on his child support obligation (SOR ¶ 1.e, $11,770). In 
December 2008, Applicant’s credit bureau report (CBR) indicates Applicant was 60 
days delinquent. (Ex. B) At that time, Applicant child/family support obligation was 
$12,004. Applicant’s February 12, 2009 pay statement indicated Applicant was paying 
monthly child support of $1,385 with an additional $250 monthly for the child support 
arrearage. (Ex. D, Tr. 40) 
 
In December 2001, Applicant opened a credit account (SOR ¶ 1.i, $1,167). The 
debt remained unpaid. In 2002, Applicant remarried. From April 2006 to October 2006, 
Applicant was laid off from work. In October 2006, he obtained his current job.  
 
Following the hearing, Applicant paid the $156 medical debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
(Ex. G, a) He made a $100 payment on the $250 medical debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Ex. 
G, b) He paid the cable bill listed in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Ex. G, c) 
 
Applicant had a credit card account with a credit union. He made payments on 
the account until 2000, when he stopped making payments. (Ex. 3) As of December 
2003, Applicant owed $3,589 (SOR ¶ 1.f). (Ex. G, f-2) By December 2007, the debt had 
increased to $4,965. (Ex. G, f-3) The credit union debts listed in SOR ¶ 1.f and SOR ¶ 
1.g are the same debt, which remains unpaid. The one account was closed out and the 
second opened. (Tr. 41)  
 
In April 2003, a $2,866 debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) was sold or transferred. In April 2006, 
an account with a collection agency was opened with a $2,886 (SOR ¶ 1.d) balance. 
(Ex. 5) Applicant’s CBR states, “Consumer disputes this account information.” (Answer 
to SOR, Ex. 4, Ex. D) 
  
In June 2007, Applicant provided a comprehensive analysis of his current 
financial situation. (Ex. 3) His monthly gross salary was $7,485 and his monthly 
disposable income was $1,855. Applicant is receiving counseling to develop a financial 
plan to address his debts. (Ex. G) In 2008, Applicant purchased a 1995 vehicle for 
$1,000. (Tr. 34, Ex. F) He makes $277 monthly payments on a 2001 vehicle. (Tr. 53)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
 
 
 
5
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Revised Adjudicative (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
 
 
6
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed 
upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk 
that is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 The record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his 
interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR 
response, and his testimony. Applicant owed more than $58,000 on past due 
obligations. He has provided insufficient documentation to show significant progress 
resolving his debts. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts,” and AG ¶19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a) – (e) are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The SOR alleges 11 past due obligations totaling in excess of $89,000. Applicant 
has paid two debts (SOR ¶ 1.a, $156 and SOR ¶ 1.c, $201) totaling less than $400. He 
is making payment on two additional debts. He made a $100 payment and has yet to 
make two additional payments totaling $150 on one debt (SOR ¶ 1.b, $250). Applicant’s 
$12,000 child support arrearage (SOR ¶ 1.e) is being repaid at a rate of $250 monthly. 
Two debts listed in the SOR are duplicates. The $3,401 (SOR ¶ 1.f) is the same as the 
 
 
 
7
$5,131 (SOR ¶ 1.g) debt. The $2,886 debt (SOR ¶ 1. d), a debt Applicant disputes, is 
the same debt as the $2,866 debt (SOR ¶ 1.h). The $5,131 debt (SOR ¶ 1.g) and the 
$1,167 (SOR ¶ 1.i) remain unpaid. 
 
Applicant owes approximately $30,000 in past due taxes, which represent three 
of the SOR debts (SOR ¶ 1.j, $6,864; SOR ¶ 1.k, $22,487; SOR ¶ 1.l, $32,229). 
Applicant’s past due taxes remains unpaid.  
 
Under AG ¶ 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to when he 
had to change work locations. He attempted to maintain two households. In 2002, 
Applicant divorced and remarried. His use of his retirement funds and relocation pay 
resulted in a tax lien of approximately $30,000. Applicant has unsuccessfully attempted 
to reach a settlement with the IRS. The behavior did not happen long ago, but his 
relocation is an event unlikely to recur. However, his taxes remain unpaid thereby 
casting doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) 
has limited applicability.  
 
Under AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with 
the financial burden associated with each. From April 2006 to October 2006, Applicant 
was laid off from work. AG & 20(b) has limited applicability because he has no plan to 
pay the tax liability. 
 
Under AG & 20(d), Applicant has paid two of the debts and is making payment 
on two other debts. Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his overdue 
obligations as to these four obligations. Under AG & 20(c), he has received financial 
counseling; however three debts totaling approximately $36,000 remain unpaid. There 
is no repayment plan for those debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. These three unpaid 
debts raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
 
 
 
8
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Applicant indicated his 
move from one state to another dictated by his work resulted in a divorce and large tax 
debt. In July 2007, Applicant became aware of the government concern about his 
finances and he answered interrogatories in July 2008. (Ex. 2, 3, 4) He has done little to 
resolve or manage his delinquent debts since learning of the government’s concern. He 
has paid approximately $500 of the debt and is repaying his child support arrearage at a 
rate of $250 monthly.  
 
 According to Applicant’s 2007 budget, he had money, approximately $1,800 
discretionary income each month, which he could have used to resolve old debts. More 
than $36,000 of debt remains unresolved. Applicant has no plan for properly addressing 
this debt.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves 
me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINSTAPPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a through 1.f:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.h:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i through 1.k:  Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
