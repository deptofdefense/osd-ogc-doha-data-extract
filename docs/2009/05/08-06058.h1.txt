Decision
______________
HENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I
conclude that Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 25,
2004. On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F
and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 16, 2008. He
answered the SOR in writing on January 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an
W hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient1
to prove controverted allegations. Directive, ¶ E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the
government must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took
place. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and
events and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring
and dissenting, in part).

administrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 12, 2009. Department
Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 12, 2009, and I received the case
assignment on February 17, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 23,
2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 24, 2009. The government
offered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence
without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits. I,
however, held the record open for 30 days for Applicant to submit additional evidence.
DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 31, 2009. On April 24, 2009,
Applicant timely submitted nine exhibits, AE A through AE I, without objection. These
exhibits have been marked and admitted into the record. The record closed on April 24,
2009.
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings
Notice
At the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice on March 6,
2009, which is more than 15 days prior to the hearing date as required under ¶ E3.1.8
of the Directive. (Tr. 8.)
Motion to Amend SOR
Department Counsel advised that the government was not moving forward with
SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleges Applicant falsified his response to question 37 on his SF 86 by
denying that he had any unpaid judgments within the preceding seven years.
Department Counsel indicated that the issue raised in allegation 2.b occurred one year
after Applicant completed and signed his SF 86. (Tr. 20.) Applicant did not object. SOR
allegation 2.b is withdrawn.
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, dated January 10, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual
allegation in ¶ 1.a of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.n
and 2.a through 2.d of the SOR.1
Applicant, who is 52 years old, works for a Department of State contractor as a
Senior Production Control Technician in the Data Processing Center. He has worked in
his Department of State contractor job since 1989, with the exception of one year

between 1994 and 1995 and two months in late 1997 and early 1998. He holds a top
secret clearance. 2
Applicant graduated from high school, then attended a technical school for data
processing training. He recently attended a bartender school and is certified as a
bartender. He worked a second full-time job from 2000 until 2004, when his employer
laid him off. As a result of the lay off, his income decreased from $108,000 a year to
approximately $60,000 a year. He has not worked a second job since 2004, but he is
now seeking part-time employment as a bartender.3
Applicant married in 1989. He and his wife separated in 2001, but have not
divorced. For several years after his separation, Applicant continued to pay the car
insurance and car payment on his wife’s car. He stopped making these payments when
he lost his second job in 2004. He has a 25 year-old son, who lives independently and is
a diabetic. He regularly provides his son with money to pay for insulin, as his son is
often short on cash.4
Applicant’s father died in 1994. For several years prior to his father’s death,
Applicant regularly travel between his home and his father’s home, about 150 miles
away, to help care for his father. He also helped his father pay for medications and has
helped other family members with expenses. He used his credit cards to pay for these
expenses. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him. He enrolled in a credit management
program. From October 1998 through August 2005, he paid approximately $550 a
month to this company, which then paid his creditors. Through this program, he
resolved many of his outstanding debts.5
In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against him
personally. IRS collected the moneys due through a bi-monthly garnishment on his
wages. From May 2003 until approximately November 2004, Applicant paid the IRS
$1,166 twice a month for a total payment of more than $44,000.6
The SOR lists numerous debts, which are listed at least once on each credit
report and sometimes more than once because the debt is under other creditor’s
names. After reviewing the credit reports dated November 4, 2004, May 25, 2006,
August 12, 2008, October 16, 2008,  and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total
GE 2 (Applicant’s response to Interrogatories, including credit report, dated August 12, 2008); GE 3 (Credit7
report, dated October 16, 2008); GE 4 (Credit report, dated May 25, 2006); GE 5 (Credit report, dated
November 4, 2004).
Applicant believed this account had been paid in his payment plan developed in 1998, but the account8
number is different.  See AE A. The credit reports show conflicting information on the status of this debt (all
the same account number), including paid, a zero balance and transferred or sold.  See GE 2, supra note 7,
at 11; GE 3, supra note 7, at 3; GE 4, supra note 7; GE 5, supra note 7.

In 2004, after he lost his second job, Appellant fell behind in paying his apartment
rent and other expenses because of the IRS garnishment.  At this time, he paid not only9
his car payment and insurance, but also the car payment and insurance for his wife for
a total of $1,300 a month (which he no longer pays). He acknowledges that his former
landlord obtained a judgment for unpaid rent in 2005 and that he has not paid this debt.
He contacted this creditor sometime ago, but has not resolved the debt as the creditor
demanded full payment and refused to accept a monthly payment.10
Two debts listed in the SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i are unknown to Applicant as he does
not recognize the listed creditor. Applicant’s credible denial of knowledge of these two
debts is sufficient to refute the allegations of delinquent debts. The pertinent credit
report did not have sufficient information for Applicant to locate the account.  11
Appellant denied owing a debt to the cable company listed in SOR allegation 1.n.
In the past, he received cable service from another cable company and two satellite
companies. Although he acknowledged at the hearing that he returned a cable box for
his girlfriend who had service with this cable company, he strongly denies any service in
his name. Subsequent to the hearing, he filed an identity theft claim on this debt.   12
Applicant also credibly denied owing the unpaid cell phone listed in allegation 1.j.
He previously had a cell phone with three other cell phone companies, but not this
company. Several years ago, he asked this creditor to provide him with evidence that he
owed them money. At that point, the creditor sent him a bill.13
Applicant currently earns $5,915 in gross income each month and $4,214 a
month in net income. His monthly expenses total approximately $4,000 and include
rent, utilities, a car payment, gasoline, credit cards, food, and a time share. He uses his
remaining income to help his son with medicine and occasionally other family
members.  14
Applicant completed his SF 86 on August 25, 2004. He answered “no” to the
following questions:
Question 36 Your Financial Record- Tax Lien
Tr.  67-69, 115-116.15
6
In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for
failing to pay taxes or other debts?
Question 38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 days
In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?
Question 39: Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days
Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?
Applicant denies that he intentionally falsified these answers. He answered “no”
to the tax lien question because he did not own property and because he paid the tax
lien through a wage garnishment, which he listed when he completed his SF 86. At the
time he completed his SF 86, he did not believe he had any debts more than 180 days
delinquent and his current bills were not 90 days overdue. He completed the SF 86 on
his computer in May or June 2004 and forwarded it to his office for review. The office
returned it to him in paper form in August 2004 for signature.15
Policies
When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as
the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available,
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in
making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
After any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and16
Appeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board’s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are
met:
E3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge’s findings of fact are supported by such relevant
evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of
all the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall
give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:
E3.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865
(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or
E3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge’s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.
The Appeal Board does not conduct a “de novo determination”, recognizing that its members have
no opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States
v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase “de novo determination”:
[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination
of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.
Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court
had occasion to define “de novo proceeding” as a review that was “unfettered by any
prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency’s]
determination is supported by substantial evidence.” In United States v. First City National
Bank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that “review de novo” means “that the
court should make an independent determination of the issues” and should not give any
special weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.
(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-
07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board
criticized the administrative judge’s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and
then decided the case itself. Judge W hite’s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations
and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes
witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,
2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board’s authority to reverse hearing-level
judicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case
No. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency’s rules and regulations is required. See
United States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-
248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining standard
of review).
7
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security
decision.  16
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
8
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in AG & 18:      
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise
security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, including federal tax debt,
and a judgment for unpaid debt, which he was unable to pay for a period of time. The
evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer
examination. 
The government has not established a prima facie case as to the debts identified
in SOR allegations 1.c and 1.i. because the government has not provided evidence
which shows the creditor for these debts. The government has not plead these
allegations with enough specificity to give Applicant notice as to whom he owes these
debts. Concerning the telephone debt identified in SOR allegation 1.j., without evidence
that Applicant signed a contract to retain the services of this company, I find that the
mere mailing of a bill is not enough to show a contractual obligation which would give
rise to the debt as a bill can be created simply and easily. SOR allegation 1.j is found in
favor of Applicant.
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition
9
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While some of
his debts occurred some time ago, he did not present evidence which shows that his
debts occurred under unusual circumstances which are not likely to reoccur in the
future. This mitigating condition is not applicable. 
Under AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the
financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant’s initial
financial problems arose when his father became ill. He not only traveled frequently, a
round trip distance of approximately 300 miles to care for his father, he also provided
financial help to assist in his father’s care. He paid for many of these costs with credit
cards. By 1998, his debt overwhelmed him and he sought consumer credit counseling.
He also obtained a second full-time job in 2000 to help pay his expenses. He and his
wife separated in 2001. As part of their informal separation agreement, he continued to
pay her car payment and car insurance until he lost his second job in 2004. I find this
mitigating condition applies as he acted reasonably under past circumstances and
shows he acted responsibly then and has since. 
Evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@
is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). As discussed above, Applicant became
overwhelmed with his debts in 1998 and retained a credit counseling agency to help him
resolve his debt issues. He developed a payment plan with this agency and complied
with the terms of the plan. He paid his debts in full by 2005. Given that the debts listed
in the SOR are not included in this debt repayment plan, this mitigating condition does
not apply.
Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has
resolved many of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, either by payment or
settlement. He completely paid his federal tax debt in 2004 through garnishment of his
wages. He has also resolved many of the debts listed in the SOR. Although the
judgment is not paid, he attempted to pay the debt through monthly payments, which
the creditor refused. The creditor’s unwillingness to accept monthly payments is not
Applicant’s fault and impedes his ability to resolve this debt. He did not ignore the debt.
He denies the two remaining unpaid debts, which total approximately $1,600. These two
unpaid debts and the unpaid judgment constitute about 15% of the debts alleged in the
SOR. His finances are sound and he acts responsibly in regards to his finances. I
conclude this mitigating condition applies.
Finally, an Applicant may mitigated security concerns under AG ¶ 20 (e) if “the
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of
See ISCR Case No. 07-08925 (App. Bd. Sept. 15, 2008); ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17,17
2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).
10
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” Applicant disputed the
debt listed in SOR allegation 1.e as believes this debt had been paid through his earlier
payment plan. While the evidence indicates his belief may not be true, his decision to
dispute this debt is reasonable based on his knowledge of the debts included in his
consolidation plan. The credit reporting agency has not responded to his notice of
dispute nor resolved the conflict in information about this debt. This mitigating condition
has some applicability to this one debt.
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.
AG ¶ 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying:
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.
For AG ¶ 16(a) to apply, Applicant’s falsification must be deliberate. The
government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he
answered “no” to Questions 36, 38 and 39 about his past due debts and tax lien. This
information is material to the evaluation of Applicant’s trustworthiness to hold a security
clearance and to his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent
to hide information about his finances. When a falsification allegation is controverted,
the government has the burden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an
omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s intent or state of
mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence
concerning an applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.17
Applicant denied intentionally leaving out information about his overdue debts
and tax lien. Because he did not own property, the IRS filed its tax lien against him
personally, then garnished his wages for payment. He disclosed the garnishment on his
Tr. 145.18
Even if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG ¶ 16(a), mitigating condition19
AG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the
allegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.
11
SF 86. In light of this information, the government acknowledged he did not falsify his
answer to the Question 36.  Applicant’s finances began to deteriorate around the time18
he completed his SF-86 because he lost his second job. At the time, he completed his
SF-86, none of his current debts were more than 90 days past due. He did not falsify his
answer to Question 39.  Concerning his “no” answer to Question 38, Applicant’s failure
to answer “yes” about his past debts is not proof that he intentionally falsified his SF 86.
The government has not established that Applicant intended to hide his financial
situation from the government. Applicant had paid and continued to pay outstanding
debts under his debt consolidation payment plan. Thus, he did not believe these debts
were past due. His belief, although mistaken, does not reflect intentional conduct on his
part. His testimony reflects that he sought to provide honest and correct information. He
provided other negative information in his SF 86 about the IRS garnishment of his
wages, which supports his position that he did not act intentionally. Guideline E is found
in favor of Applicant.19
Whole Person Concept
Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or
deny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both
favorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the
evidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is
established and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant’s eligibility
for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,
12
but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a
nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. 
In reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant ‘s
financial problems began about 15 years ago and continued until very recently. His
financial problems are the result, in part, of poor choices made about spending money.
Even though his financial problems began many years ago, the mitigating evidence
under the whole person concept is more substantial. Applicant’s financial problems
began when his father became ill. Recognizing his responsibility as a son, he traveled,
at his own expense, to his father’s home and cared for him. He also provided financial
assistance to his father for medication and other necessary expenses. For four years
after his father died, he unsuccessfully attempted to pay his debts. In 1998, he sought
and received financial counseling through debt consolidation. For the next seven years,
he routinely paid the counseling service, when then paid his creditors until the bills were
paid. His decision to seek help with his finances and his compliance with the program
shows that he not only acted in a responsible manner, but that he is willing to accept
responsibility for his debts. He also worked two jobs full-time in an effort to pay his
debts, certain expenses for his estranged wife, and his living expenses. For four years,
he managed his expenses, including a substantial monthly payment to the IRS. Through
these efforts, he resolved much of his debt. His financial problems began anew when he
lost one of his full-time jobs in 2004. Over the last five years, he has worked slowly to
resolve his new financial issues. His one major unpaid debt is not resolved or being
resolved because the creditor is uncooperative, not for lack of effort on Applicant’s part.
Because of his long history of debt resolution, his statement that he tried to resolve the
judgment debt is credible.
 
Applicant has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent
debts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He has not paid two small debts
listed in the SOR because these debts are not his. He is taking action on one of these
debts. Even though he has had financial problems, he has demonstrated a meaningful
track record of debt repayment.  He is not required to be debt free to hold a security
clearance. Rather, he must manages his finances and live within his financial means.
The issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial
circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. While some
debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise security concerns, particularly since
he has resolved the majority of his debts. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial
