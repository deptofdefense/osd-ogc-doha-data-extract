APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On April 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On November 12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton
Anthony denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant
to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
To the extent that Applicant’s brief is challenging the hiring policy of private companies, the Board is in no1
position to comment.  Our authority is defined by the Directive and does not extent to such matters.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse clearance
decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.
Applicant argues that it was unfair of the Judge to deny him a clearance just because he was
originally from Iraq and had family members living in that country and in-laws living in Syria.
Applicant’s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious or
contrary to law.
There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking
to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at
4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether an applicant personally believes the Judge was
unfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead
a reasonable person to question her fairness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.
19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings
or reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,
2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,
standing alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of persuasion, in
that he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable
person to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).1
The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven circumstances
under any of its Guidelines and an applicant’s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-
22643 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 03-18218 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2005).  DOHA has adjudicated foreign preference
cases involving applicants associated with or having family ties to a wide variety of countries.
Foreign ties such as the ones maintained by Applicant are of legitimate concern to the Department
in assessing risks to the nation’s security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.
27, 2003).
Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the
applicant to establish mitigation.  Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence
does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,
the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs
the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,
2007).  An applicant’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue
for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the
evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,
e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).
In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the
SOR paragraph 1(c).2
seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant
conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR factual allegations.2
However, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the
government’s security concerns under Guideline B.  The Board does not review a case de novo.
After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and
articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the
facts found and the choice made.’” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  “The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when
‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484
U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under
Guideline B is sustainable.
Order
The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
