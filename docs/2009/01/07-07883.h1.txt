  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition to the Executive
Order and Directive, this case is adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December
29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1,
2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all
adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.
The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is
dated after the effective date.

Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order,
DoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals1
(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 9, 2008. The SOR is
2
equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action.
The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations, Guideline E
for personal conduct, and Guideline J for criminal conduct. The allegations under the
three guidelines all center around Applicant’s indebtedness. 
Applicant’s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 3, 2008, and he
requested a hearing. It took place as scheduled pursuant to written notice on November
19, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 26, 2008. 
The record was left open until December 3, 2008, to allow Applicant an
opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner
and those matters (as described in Applicant’s cover letter) are admitted, without
objections, as Exhibit B. In addition, he submitted two letters concerning debts not
alleged in the SOR, but which he has successfully resolved. Those documents are
admitted, without objections, as Exhibit C.  
Applicant submitted additional documentary evidence, which was mailed on or
about December 18, 2008. Although past the deadline, department counsel had no
objections. Those matters (as described in Applicant’s cover letter) are admitted as
Exhibit D. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. 
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes nine creditors the total
sum of approximately $70,000 in delinquent debt. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged
that Applicant gave deliberately false answers in response to two questions about his
financial record when he completed a security-clearance application. Under Guideline J,
the SOR cross-alleged the falsification allegations as criminal conduct in violation of
Title 18 U.S.C. 1001 (making a false statement within the jurisdiction of a federal
agency). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts except for the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, to which he claimed it was included in the debt alleged in ¶ 1.f. He
denied the falsification allegations and the related criminal conduct allegation. Based on
the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial
evidence.
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been
employed as a field service representative working in communications since January
2007. His annual salary is about $49,000. He has been married since 1981. He and his
wife have two children, ages 18 and 16. His wife has been unemployed for various
reasons, including medical, since about 2003. She is now seeking employment. 
His employment history includes about 23 years of military service in the U.S.
Army (Exhibit B–DD Forms 214). He first served as an enlisted soldier from 1976 to
1991 and he reached the grade of sergeant first class. He then served as a warrant
officer from 1991 to 1999 when he retired at the grade of chief warrant officer two. He
 Based on these findings, I conclude that Applicant did not give deliberately false answers. Accordingly, the2
personal conduct and criminal conduct allegations are decided in Applicant’s favor and will not be discussed
further. 
 This summary is based on Applicant’s Exhibits A, B, and D, and his hearing testimony. 3

worked in communications and he held a security clearance, to include a top-secret
clearance (Exhibit B–DA Form 873).
Applicant has worked for federal contractors since retiring from the Army in
October 1999. He worked as field engineer at different locations, to include overseas,
from January 2000 to January 2006. He was then unemployed until he started his
current employment in January 2007. 
He completed a security-clearance application in February 2007 (Exhibit 1). He
was required to answer various questions about his background, to include his financial
record. He denied having been over 180 days delinquent on any debts during the last
seven years in response to Question 28a. Likewise, he denied that he was currently
over 90 days delinquent on any debts in response to Question 28b. Applicant did not
report any delinquencies because he was unaware of any, as his wife had primary
responsibility for bill paying and household financial matters. In a written statement, his
wife admitted overspending and failing to inform him of their delinquent accounts
(Exhibit A).  2
Applicant has a history of financial problems. The delinquent debts alleged in the
SOR are established by Applicant’s admissions and the admitted evidence (Exhibits 2,
3, 4, and 5). To date, Applicant has not paid-in-full, settled, or otherwise resolved any of
the alleged debts. But he and his wife were successful in establishing repayment plans
for many of the debts. In addition, they paid-in-full one debt not alleged in the SOR, and
they successfully disputed another debt not alleged in the SOR (Exhibit C). 
The status of the nine debts in the SOR is summarized in the following table.3
Debts Status
SOR ¶ 1.a–$7,633 collection account. In repayment plan since July 2008 with
monthly payments of $250 (Exhibit A,
Tab A). Balance of $6,563 as of Dec.
2008 (Exhibit D, Tab 2).
SOR ¶ 1.b–$13,782 collection account. In repayment plan with law firm since
Sep. 2008 with $200 monthly payments
(Exhibit A, Tab F). Judgment obtained
but not yet executed provided payments
are made. Balance of $13,057 as of Nov.
2008 (Exhibit D, Tab 2).

SOR ¶ 1.c–$9,224 collection account. In repayment plan with law firm since
Sep. 2008 with $200 monthly payments
(Exhibit A, Tab G). Balance of $7,642 as
of Nov. 2008 (Exhibit D, Tab 3).
SOR ¶ 1.d–$17,957 charged-off account. In repayment plan since Jul. 2008 with
$200 monthly payments (Exhibit A, Tab
H). Balance of $22,256 as of Dec. 2008
(Exhibit D, Tab 2).
SOR ¶ 1.e–$799 charged-off account. Included in debt (same creditor) alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.f.
SOR ¶ 1.f–$10,364 collection account. In repayment plan since Sep. 2008 with
$200 monthly payments (Exhibit A, Tab
C). Balance of $9,764 as of Dec. 2008
(Exhibit D, Tab 3).
SOR ¶ 1.g–$4,024 delinquent account. Unresolved; searching for creditor
(Exhibit A, Tab D; Exhibit D, Tab 5).
SOR ¶ 1.h–$3,353 delinquent account. In repayment plan since Aug. 2008 with
$100 monthly payments (Exhibit A, Tab
I). Balance of $3,029 as of Dec. 2008
(Exhibit D, Tab 4).
SOR ¶ 1.i–$2,930 delinquent account. In repayment plan since Jul. 2008 with
$75 monthly payments (Exhibit A, Tab J).
Brought current as a credit card account
with a balance of $3,053 as of Nov. 2008
(Exhibit A, Tab J; Exhibit D, Tab 4).
To sum up, six accounts are in repayment plans, one account is now current, one
account is included in another, and one account is unresolved.
In addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant presented evidence of two other
delinquent accounts. The first delinquency is a past-due account owed to the federal
government (the Army & Air Force Exchange Service or AAFES) in the amount of
$7,857 with a demand for a minimum monthly payment of $654 (Exhibit A, Tab L).
Applicant was unable to meet that demand and responded with a monthly payment of
$50 in November 2008, which is in addition to a monthly payment of $77 via deduction
or offset from his retired pay. As of December 2008, the balance was $7,887 (Exhibit D,
Tab 3). 
The second delinquency is a collection account with a balance of $11,638 as of
October 2008 (Exhibit A, Tab K). The creditor offered Applicant a 40% discount to settle
by making a lump-sum payment. Unable to do so, Applicant responded by agreeing to
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to a4
security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (“It is likewise plainth
that there is no ‘right’ to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases
such as Duane’s.”).

make $100 monthly payments. His most recent payment was on November 28, 2008
(Exhibit D, Tab 3). 
Applicant receives retired pay of $2,496 monthly (gross), which is nearly $30,000
annually (Exhibit A–retiree account statement). Review of the account statement shows,
however, that Applicant takes home very little. The September 2008 account statement
shows a taxable income of $1,903, multiple allotments for $1,665, and a net pay of
$17.41. 
Applicant and his wife sold a home in about January 2008 (Tr. 67–68). They
made a profit of about $20,000. Applicant’s wife gave some of the money to her
parents, and Applicant and his wife used some of it to pay bills and debts. About $5,000
or $6,000 remained after doing so. Now, Applicant estimates having about $8,000 in the
bank, but no other financial assets other than personal property.  
Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4
As noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, “the
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an5
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-
secret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any6
existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any
level and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order7
10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting8
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An9
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate10
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme11
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12
The agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s
findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when
evaluating a person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration
of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication
factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified
information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it
grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security
clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination14
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for
granting eligibility for a security clearance.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically15
exists due to significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means,
satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information.”  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be16
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and
safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of
financial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it
 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 17
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 18
7
indicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting17
financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more18
than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.
The guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security
concerns:
MC 1–the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
MC 2–the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
MC 3–the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
MC 4–the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
MC 5–the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
MC 6–the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
 
All the mitigating conditions have been considered and two justify discussion. The first is
MC 2, which concerns events or circumstances largely beyond a person’s control. The
second is MC 4, which concerns initiating a good-faith effort to repay. Each is discussed
below. 
Applicant receives credit in mitigation under MC 2 because his financial problems
resulted from events or circumstances largely beyond his control. The primary events or
circumstances were as follows: (1) his wife’s unemployment since 2003; (2) his
unemployment in 2006; and (3) his wife’s overspending and withholding of information
about their finances. Taken together, these events or circumstances had a snowball or
cumulative effect, the consequences of which Applicant is still experiencing. 
 Revised Guidelines at 1–2 (setting forth nine factors to consider). 19
 Revised Guidelines at 2 (“the likelihood of continuation or recurrence”).20
8
In addition, Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He returned to
full-time employment in January 2007, and, once being fully aware of the situation, has
worked with his wife to address his indebtedness. Given the particular facts of this case,
Applicant has acted responsibly under difficult circumstances.  
Applicant also receives credit under MC 4 due to his efforts to repay creditors as
detailed in the table above. His actions, although at the beginning stages, are sufficient
to qualify as initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline.
To sum up under the whole-person concept,  this case presents both19
disqualifying and mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing.
Applicant is in a difficult spot facing a mountain of debt. The six delinquent accounts in
repayment plans plus the two other delinquent accounts (not alleged in the SOR)
amount to approximately $81,836 in delinquent debt. He has a daunting task ahead of
him with limited financial means and a spouse with a history of overspending. Although
he presented documentary evidence of his efforts to resolve his indebtedness, he did
not present sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns. His efforts to date
are a good start, but he has made little progress in light of the size of his indebtedness.
His track record of repayment at this point is skimpy and not sufficient to overcome the
security concerns. 
To conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,
or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the
whole-person concept (to include his many years of honorable military service) was
given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision.
Indeed, looking forward to the next 12 to 24 months, it is highly unlikely that he will
successfully resolve his financial problems.  This case is decided against Applicant. 20
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.i: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: For Applicant
Paragraph 3, Guideline J: For Applicant
Subparagraph 3.a: For Applicant
9
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for
access to classified information is denied.
