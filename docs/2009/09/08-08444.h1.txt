Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant was twice convicted of underage drinking offenses in 2004. He was
convicted of underage drinking and driving in 2005. He was charged with Driving While
Intoxicated (DWI) in 2006. He has not driven a vehicle after consuming alcohol since he
was charged with DWI in 2006, and he now consumes alcohol responsibly and in
moderation. Applicant has mitigated the security concern that was created by his alcohol
consumption. 
On April 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant’s
response to the SOR was received by DOHA on April 23, 2009. Applicant admitted all
allegations and requested a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on
July 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 17, 2009. The hearing was conducted as
scheduled. The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified but did not offer any other evidence. The transcript was received on August 25,
2009.     
Findings of Fact
After a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 23-year-old single man who has been employed as a welder by a
defense contractor since March 2008. He graduated from high school in June 2004, and
worked steadily at a variety of jobs until he became unemployed in December 2006. He
attended a technical school from January 2006 until January 2007, from which he received
a certificate in welding. He obtained employment as a welder in April 2007, and he worked
continuously as such for several non-government contractors until he was hired by his
present employer. 
Applicant began drinking alcohol with friends when he was about 16 years old. He
estimates he drank about 12 beers on almost every weekend while he was in high school.
In June 2004, and again in December 2004, he was charged with and convicted of
Underage Consumption. He was fined about $150, including court costs, following both of
these convictions.
Applicant was charged with Inattentive Driving, Underage Drinking and Driving,
Open Bottle Law (Possession), and Underage Consumption on September 25, 2005.
Applicant testified he had only consumed two drinks over the course of an hour or two
before he was arrested and that while his blood alcohol content (BAC) disclosed he had
been drinking alcohol as a minor he was not intoxicated. (Tr. 47-48) He provided a
statement on June 4, 2008, in which he stated his BAC was about 0.04 to 0.06 at the time.
(GE 2) He pled guilty to and was convicted of Underage Drinking and Driving on March 3,
2006, and he was sentenced to unsupervised probation for one year and ordered to serve
45 days in jail (stayed for one year). Additional conditions of his probationary sentence
included no possession of alcohol or drugs and attendance at a Mothers Against Drunk
Driving (MADD) Impact Panel. Applicant admits he did not benefit from attendance at this
MADD panel because he thought at the time that he should not have been required to
attend it since he had not been driving while intoxicated. (Tr. 51)
Applicant continued to consume alcohol following his March 2006 conviction in
violation of his probation. On June 10, 2006, he was charged with 4  Degree Driving Whileth
Impaired,  Operate a Motor Vehicle - Alcohol Concentration 0.08 Within 2 Hours, and2
a child under the age of 16 in the motor vehicle. Minn. Stat.§169A.03.

Underage Drinking and Driving. Applicant estimates he had consumed about 12 beers at
a city festival during the course of the day before he was arrested. On April 2, 2007, he
pled guilty to the offense of Operate a Motor Vehicle - Alcohol Concentration 0.08 Within
2 Hours and the remaining charges were dismissed. He was placed on unsupervised
probation for two years, sentenced to serve 45 days in jail (44 days stayed for two years),
and fined $400. Other terms of probation included attendance at a MADD Impact Panel
and completion of a 2-day DWI program. Applicant apparently was impacted by his second
attendance at a MADD panel because as he testified his drinking habits “have gotten a lot
better ever since I’ve had to take my MADD impact panel classes.” (Tr. 29)
As a consequence of the conviction, Applicant’s driving privileges were suspended
by the state for six months following his April 2007 conviction. Despite the suspension,
Applicant continued to drive to and from work because he was unable to obtain another
means of transportation to get to his place of employment. He was convicted of speeding
on May 31, 2007, of failure to drive in a single lane and driving after suspension on
September 13, 2007, and no drivers license in possession or failure to display upon
request on September 22, 2008. He was fined as a result of each of these convictions. 
Applicant credibly testified he has neither operated a motor vehicle after consuming
alcohol nor consumed alcohol while he remained underage since he was convicted of the
DWI in April 2007. He currently drinks no more than a couple of beers on weekends, once
or twice a month, while at bars with friends. Because of a medical condition, Applicant does
not consume any alcoholic beverages other than beer. He recently purchased a house and
he plans on returning to a technical school to obtain additional training in welding skills. 
       
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1
through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition
or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.
Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with its
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of3 4

proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the6
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to7
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable8
clearance decision.9
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard10
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access11
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      12
Analysis
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability
and trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] ¶ 21)  
Applicant began consuming alcohol while he was still in high school. He was twice
convicted of underage drinking in 2004, and of underage drinking and driving in 2005. He
was convicted of 4  Degree DWI in April 2007, for an offense that occurred in June 2006.th
Disqualifying Condition (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol
abuser or alcohol dependent applies.
Applicant is an unsophisticated young man who appears to have learned a
convincing lesson following his 2007 DWI conviction. While he had three prior alcohol-
related offenses, only one of those involved the operation of a motor vehicle and his BAC
at that time was under the presumptive limit for intoxication. The other two were based
5
solely on him consuming alcohol while being underage. He is now of age and he credibly
testified that he consumes alcohol responsibly and in moderation. He also credibly testified
he never operates a motor vehicle after he has consumed alcohol. 
Considering Applicant’s age at the time he committed the alcohol-related offenses,
his steady work history before and after completing welding training, that over three years
have passed since his last alcohol related offense, and his overall testimony, appearance,
and demeanor, I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) 23(a): so much time has passed . . . that
it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 23(b): the individual acknowledges his . . .
issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and
has established a pattern of . . . responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) apply.
  
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded assessment of
a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The “whole
person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts and
omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all
relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful
analysis. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive,
and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the
security concern caused by his alcohol consumption. He has overcome the case against
him and satisfied his burden of persuasion. Guideline G is decided for  Applicant. It is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline G: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-f: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is granted.
