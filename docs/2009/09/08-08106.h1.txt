Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern created by his long history of
financial irresponsibility. He failed to take any action to resolve most of the debts listed in
the Statement of Reasons (SOR), and his testimony and the evidence he presented give
little reason to anticipate he will resolve those debts in the foreseeable future.
On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR, dated March 24, 2009, admitted all SOR allegations,
and requested a hearing.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS
 In the security clearance application he submitted in March 2008 (GE 1), Applicant listed continuous2
employment from October 1996 to October 2007. However, he testified he was actually unemployed for about
one year from some time in 1999 until sometime in 2000. (Tr. 47-52)

The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on
July 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 17, 2009. The hearing was conducted as
scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant
testified and submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant’s Exhibits
(AE) 1 & 2 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on
August 25, 2009.     
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In
addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 40-year-old man who has been employed as a security officer by a
defense contractor since March 2008. From June 2001 until October 2007, he worked as
a corrections officer in the state where he resides. He was fired from that position because
he failed to report misconduct committed by another corrections officer as was required of
him. Applicant previously worked as a corrections officer in another state from October
1996, until either June 2001, or sometime in late 1999.2
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1987. He was awarded a bachelor of
science degree in criminal justice in December 2006, and a master of public administration
degree through an online program in May 2009. 
Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1988 until
August 1996. The highest rank he attained was sergeant (paygrade E-5). He was
discharged as a private (paygrade E-2). He testified the reduction in rank was solely due
to him being absent without leave for a week and that he received an honorable discharge.
(Tr. 90) 
Applicant was first married in July 1988. That marriage ended in divorce in January
1997. He has been remarried since July 1999. Applicant has three children, ages 20, 13,
and 5. His oldest daughter is attending college on a full scholarship and he provides her
with about $200 per month in financial assistance. The two younger children reside with
Applicant and his wife.
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 1999. The bankruptcy
was dismissed in April 2001, because Applicant failed to comply with the plan that had
been established to repay his creditors. The listed creditors in the bankruptcy included a
1997 judgment based on a repossessed automobile, student loans, personal loans, a bank
overdraft, and at least several credit card companies. Applicant never attempted to make
repayment arrangements with any of these creditors after the bankruptcy was dismissed.
 This amount includes $370.41 that is listed in Applicant’s monthly statement from the IRS (AE 2)3
under the heading of “Liabilities not shown.” 
3
Applicant owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2006.
As of August 5, 2009, the total amount he owed was $3,746.70.  Applicant contacted the3
Internal Revenue Service shortly before the hearing of this case and entered into a
repayment agreement that requires him to make monthly payments of $200 commencing
on August 15, 2009. Applicant testified he placed the first payment in the mail on August
11, 2009 (Tr. 97), but he did not submit any verification in support of that testimony.  
The judgment listed in Applicant’s 1999 bankruptcy as owing in the amount of
$7,071, and in the SOR as owing in the amount of $7,061, has now risen to approximately
$11,500 through the accumulation of interest. (Tr. 62-63) The judgment is currently being
satisfied through a garnishment of Applicant’s wages.
The SOR lists 11 delinquent accounts, totaling $7,957, that have been submitted
for collection. The dates of last activity on those accounts range from December 2001 to
January 2008. Most of the dates of last activity occurred between September 2005 and
September 2007. Applicant has not made any payment on any of these debts. He also has
not contacted any of these creditors in an effort to make repayment arrangements. The
only action he has taken to resolve his delinquent debts is to obtain a packet of bankruptcy
documents from a document preparation service and fill them out in contemplation of filing
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection sometime in the near future. 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his reported periods of unemployment,
his current low wages, and to his wife leaving her employment with the same company for
which he now works. When he was interviewed on July 14, 2008, Applicant stated he and
his wife each earned $31,000 annually. (GE 3) He now earns $13.50 per hour working full-
time, and his wife earns $11 per hour working about 20-30 hours per week.  
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial decision based upon the relevant and
material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶
6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular
condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy
guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating
conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an

applicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of4 5
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6
although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of
proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the7
evidence.”  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to8
present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable9
clearance decision.10
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard11
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access12
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      13
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999. The repayment plan
established for him under that bankruptcy was dismissed in 2001 due to his noncompliance
with the plan. He owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2002, 2003, and
2006. He has 11 delinquent collection accounts, totalling $7,957, that have been
 A review of Applicant’s credit report (GE 4)  indicates it is possible that some accounts listed in the14
SOR are duplicates of other accounts listed therein. However, it is impossible to make such a determination
solely through a review of the credit report with any degree of certainty. Applicant admitted each account in
his response to the SOR and thereafter failed to provide any evidence to meet his burden of establishing that
any account is in fact a duplication of any other account.

delinquent for years.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to14
satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.
Applicant listed continuous employment from October 1996 until October 2007 in
the security clearance application he submitted in March 2008, when he obtained his
current employment. He testified to the contrary that he was actually unemployed for about
one year between 1999 and 2000. He was fired from a job that he held from June 2001
until October 2007, because he failed to abide by a condition of his employment as a
corrections officer that he report the misconduct of co-workers. He partly attributes his
financial problems to these periods of unemployment. He also blames his financial
problems to low income due partly to his wife voluntarily leaving a job that was paying her
$31,000 annually.
The record establishes that a judgment was entered against Applicant based on a
repossessed auto in 1997, long before he ever became unemployed. He owes delinquent
federal income taxes for three years during which he was employed as a corrections
officer. The date of last activity on most of his delinquent accounts occurred before he was
fired from his job in October 2007. Accordingly, and regardless if he was unemployed from
1999 until 2000 or not, his financial problems began before either period of unemployment,
continued through his lengthy period of employment as a corrections officer, and have not
begun to be resolved. 
 
I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the
financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): . . . there are clear
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts
do not apply. 
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense
assessment of a person’s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.
The “whole person” concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts
and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration
all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful
analysis.   
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the
6
financial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him or
satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-n: Against Applicant
Conclusion               
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
