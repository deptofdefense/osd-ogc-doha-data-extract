HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial consideration security concerns. Applicant’s 
statement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 delinquent debts, totaling $14,859. Because of 
duplications, she had seven delinquent debts totaling about $9,500. Applicant settled 
and paid her SOR debts. She does not currently have any delinquent debt. Clearance is 
granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
In December 2006, Applicant submitted an undated Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Tr. 55; GE 
1). On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for 
access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On May 16, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 
23, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 25, 2009. On March 26, 2009, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 6, 2009. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-22), and 
Applicant offered five exhibits (Tr. 23-27, 48-49; AE A-E). There were no objections, and 
I admitted GEs 1-5 (Tr. 22), and AEs A-E (Tr. 27, 48-49). Additionally, I admitted the 
SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 6-8). I received the transcript 
on April 15, 2009. I received a letter from a character witness (AE F) after the hearing 
and the letter was admitted without objection (AE F). I closed the record on April 20, 
2009 (Tr. 12-13).  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In her SOR response, Applicant admitted her responsibility for the debts listed in 
the SOR; however, she said some debts were duplications (GE 8). She also provided 
proof some debts were paid, settled and paid, or otherwise resolved. Her admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is 28 years old (Tr. 6, 28). In 2002, she received her bachelor’s degree 
in psychology with a minor in criminal justice (Tr. 6, 28). In 2003, she moved to a 
different state and worked as a social worker (Tr. 29). She has worked for a government 
contractor as a financial systems analyst since 2006 (Tr. 29). She married in April 2003 
(Tr. 31). Her husband has been in the U.S. Navy for nine years (Tr. 60). He is a 
Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 31, 56). Her husband is a pilot (Tr. 32). She does not 
have any children (Tr. 31). She is seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 30). 
  
Financial considerations 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.k), totaling $14,859. Because of duplications, she actually had seven delinquent 
debts, totaling about $9,500. Applicant incurred delinquent debts in 1999 when she was 
in college (Tr. 19). She was ill and missed work for about three weeks causing her to fall 
behind on her payments to her creditors (Tr. 20, 50-51; AE E). After her illness, she

information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
changed employment; however, her new employment paid a lower salary (Tr. 51-52). 
She moved and she lost contact with her creditors (Tr. 20). After she moved to a 
different state, her pay was still low because she worked as a social worker (Tr. 53).  
 
Applicant established through her hearing statement and the documents she 
provided that her SOR debts were all resolved. The resolution of her SOR debts is more 
specifically described as follows:  
 
(1) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($2,075), 1.j ($2,033) and 1.k ($2,096) are 
duplications of the same account. This credit card account was settled for $1,200. 
Applicant made $600 payments on May 8 and 16, 2008 (Tr. 33-34, 43-44, 46; GE 8 at 
1, 3, 5; AE A at 1, 2, 3, 12, 13). Applicant sent several letters to the creditor to obtain 
proof that the accounts were duplications; however, she did not receive replies (Tr. 43-
44). I accept her statement that the accounts are duplications as credible (Tr. 43-44);  
 
(2) This department store account of $566, was settled for $469. She paid $469 
on May 8, 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.b; Tr. 35; GE 8 at 1, 6; AE A at 1, 2, 3);  
 
(3) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($956) and 1.f ($957) are the same debt. This credit 
card debt was settled and paid as follows: $282 paid on March 21, 2008, and $225 paid 
on April 16, 2008 (Tr. 35-38, 40; GE 2 at 3; GE 8 at 2, 7, 8; AE A at 4, 8);  
 
(4) This credit card debt of $2,059, was settled for $1,100, and Applicant made 
payments as follows: $200 on March 21, 2008, $225 on April 16, 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.d, GE 
8 at 2). The creditor provided a letter indicating this debt was paid (Tr. 38; AE A at 5);  
 
(5) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($343) and 1.h ($258) are the same debt, and they 
pertain to a clothing store account. This credit card debt was settled for $300 and paid 
on May 8, 2008 (Tr. 38-40; GE 8 at 2, 9, 10; AE A at 6, 7, 10). Although Applicant did 
not have documentation proving these two accounts were duplications of each other, 
the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.h could not find the account (Tr. 41-42). I accept her statement 
that the accounts are duplications as credible (Tr. 41-42);  
 
(6) This credit card debt of $2,627, was settled for $1,383, and she provided 
proof of payments made as follows: $433 on March 21, 2008, and $225 on April 16, 
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.g; Tr. 41; GE 8 at 2; AE A at 9). A letter from the creditor, dated March 
12, 2009, indicates the account is resolved (Tr. 41; AE A at 9);  
 
(7) This department store account for $889 was settled for $642. Applicant paid 
this debt on March 18, 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.i; Tr. 43; GE 8 at 3, 15, 16; AE A at 11).  
 
Applicant’s salary from her employment as a government contractor has tripled 
from when she started working for the contractor, and she is now earning about $55,000 
annually (Tr. 31, 53). She earns an additional $600 monthly from her part-time 
employment as an aerobics instructor (Tr. 30, 31). Her husband’s annual salary is about 
$54,000. Applicant and her husband have ample income for their lifestyle and save 
 
 
4 
 
about $1,500 monthly (Tr. 58). They have retained about $3,000 in their checking 
account, $10,000 in their savings account, and $20,000 in certificates of deposit, as 
“rainy day” funds (Tr. 58-60). She has one credit card and it is current (Tr. 61). Credit 
reports in March 2008, June 2008, and March 2009, do not show any currently 
delinquent accounts (Tr. 61-62, 64; GE 3-5). 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s friend has known Applicant for more than 20 years (AE F). She has 
attended the same schools with Applicant. She has closely followed Applicant’s career 
after Applicant completed college. She vouches for Applicant’s honesty, integrity and 
trustworthiness. She recommends approval of Applicant’s security clearance (AE F). 
 
Another character witness has known Applicant since 2005 (AE D). She lauds 
Applicant’s intelligence, organizational skills, trustworthiness, and high ethical 
standards. She recommends Applicant for a security clearance (AE D). 
  
Applicant provided two performance evaluations, which showed her solid work 
product (AE B and C). She is a hard worker, who is progressing in her development. 
She has strong ratings in job knowledge and communication skills. She maintains the 
highest professional standards.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
 
 
5 
 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 
 
6 
 
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SOR response and at her 
hearing. In 1999, she fell behind on some of her credit cards and department store 
accounts. As indicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.k, she had 11 delinquent debts, totaling 
$14,859. Because of duplications, the she actually had seven delinquent debts, totaling 
about $9,500. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b) or 
20(e) because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her 
delinquent debts. Her delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives 
partial credit under AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) because her financial problems initially 
resulted when she was ill and unable to work. After her illness, she was underemployed 
for several years. Her delinquent debts also “occurred under such circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Moreover, she established that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances, when she paid or settled and paid all of the 
 
 
7 
 
                                           
delinquent SOR debts.2 AG ¶ 20(e) does not fully apply because she did not dispute all 
of her SOR debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does fully apply to the debts that were duplications. 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant paid or settled and paid her delinquent debts. 
There are “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” She 
understands the security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid 
future delinquent debt. She has also established mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because 
she showed good faith3 in the resolution of her SOR debts.    
 
Although Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts, her payment of the remaining SOR debts is 
adequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 1999, Applicant’s 
debts became delinquent because of her brief illness. However, years passed without 
resolution of her delinquent debts. The SOR lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.k), totaling $14,859. Because of duplications, she actually had seven debts, totaling 
about $9,500 that were at one time or another delinquent during the last four years. She 
failed to keep her accounts current and negotiate lesser payments when her income 
decreased, showing some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. When she 
returned to full employment, she did not aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. 
Her history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. A brief 
medical illness caused her income to significantly decline, and her credit card accounts 
became delinquent. Ultimately, she paid or settled and paid her delinquent SOR debts. 
Her remaining debts, such as one credit card, and car payments are current. She and 
her husband have savings and certificates of deposit totaling about $30,000. The 
Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial 
cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
 
 
9 
 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is 28 years old. She has earned her bachelor’s degree. She had worked for a 
government contractor as a financial systems analyst since 2006 and her salary from 
the contractor has tripled from when she started working for the contractor. She now 
earns about $62,000 annually (includes her part-time employment as an aerobics 
instructor). She married in April 2003. Her husband is a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, 
and has an annual salary of about $54,000. She made mistakes, and debts became 
delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt payments by actually paying all of her 
delinquent SOR debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
She has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to 
the Department of Defense as a defense contractor and through her support of her 
husband, a Naval officer. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and 
all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
she is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.k:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
