HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. His 
statement of reasons (SOR) listed 25 delinquent debts totaling about $155,000. He paid 
five SOR debts totaling about $3,300. He disputed two debts totaling about $5,500. He 
has a payment plan on his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt and state tax debt, 
totaling about $60,000. He has not made sufficient progress resolving about $80,000 of 
remaining delinquent debt. Clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 10, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86), 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On September 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to 
deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); 
Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
 
 
2 
                                           
January 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed 
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On January 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 
12, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2009. On March 18, 2009, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 7, 2009. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17), and 
Applicant offered 13 exhibits (AE A-M; Tr. 18-21). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GEs 1-6 and AE A-M (Tr. 17, 21, 98-99). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, 
response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April 
14, 2009. The record was held open until April 28, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit 
additional evidence (Tr. 82, 97, 99). On April 28, 2009, I received three telefaxes from 
Applicant AE N (14 pages), AE O (four pages) and AE P (8 pages).  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for 21 of the 25 debts 
listed in the SOR. He said he paid three of the remaining 21 delinquent debts, and one 
debt was in a payment plan. He did not address resolution of the 17 remaining debts 
totaling about $87,000 with specificity about when payments were made or in what 
amounts. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is 38 years old (Tr. 6). He graduated from high school in 1989 (Tr. 6). 
His six children (including adopted children, step children and foster children) were born 
in 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, and 1999 (Tr. 89; GE 1). He completed three years of 
college (Tr. 6). He has not served in the military (Tr. 6). In 2003, he received a score of 
83 out of 100 points on a police department examination (AE E). He has previously held 
a public trust position for several years; however, he has not held a security clearance 
(Tr. 23). His spouse does not work outside their home (Tr. 89). Applicant’s daughter 
was admitted to a hospital in 2006 and 2007 for her severe asthma (Tr. 34). Insurance 
companies paid her medical expenses, which amounted to about a million dollars (Tr. 
35). In December 2006, Applicant discovered that his spouse was having an affair (Tr. 
35). Applicant received counseling to assist him with the stress from his daughter’s 
illness and his spouse’s infidelity (Tr. 35).   
 
Applicant has an impressive professional career spanning 16 years of 
information technology experience, supporting the federal government. He is now a

information is available in the cited exhibits.

senior software engineer and architect (AE F at 5). He is a Microsoft Certified 
Professional and Application Developer (AE J). He has trained, led and instructed 
others on software development and information technology utilization (AE F at 5). He 
provided an extremely detailed resume, which lists his training, work assignments, and 
accomplishments from 1992 to the present (AE G at 1-21). His current essential duties 
and responsibilities, including designing and completion of complex projects, show an 
impressive ability to document and organize complex endeavors (AE H at 1-11). His 
Project Completion Forms document Applicant’s extraordinary ability to plan, lead 
teams, and accomplish highly complex goals (AE I at 1-42). He has established that he 
is dedicated, intelligent, hard working, and goal oriented with superb attention to detail 
(AE F-I). He has impressed his supervisors and customers with his duty performance, 
initiative and professionalism (AE K). He made substantial contributions to mission 
accomplishment (AE K, L, M). He volunteers as a health care worker (AE F at 1). He 
also volunteered his assistance at the 2009 Presidential Inauguration (AE F at 3-4).  
 
Applicant’s security clearance application indicates he has never been arrested 
or charged with any crime (GE 1). In the last seven years, he has not used any illegal 
drugs (GE 1). In the last seven years, he has not received treatment or counseling for 
alcohol or drug abuse (GE 1). He candidly disclosed a variety of financial problems on 
his 2006 security clearance application (GE 1). 
 
Financial considerations 
 
Applicant conceded he had ten years of bad credit, but believed he has acted 
responsibly to remedy his credit during the last two years (Tr. 96). In the late 1990s, 
Applicant began to fall behind on his debts (Tr. 45). Other debts became delinquent in 
2001 and 2002 (Tr. 45).  Applicant’s response to DOHA interrogatories on November 7, 
2007, indicated the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.d were paid (GE 5 at 2), the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.e and 1.n were not his debts (GE 5 at 3, 6), payment arrangements were made or 
being made on SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.q and 1.u (GE 5 at 3, 4, 10), and no action was taken on 
the remaining SOR debts (GE 5 at 4-13).   
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($3,500) became delinquent in 2001 or 2002, when 
Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed (Tr. 45). He provided a printout he made showing 
one payment on this debt made on March 6, 2009; however, he did not provide the 
amount of this payment (AE N at 8). 
 
Applicant’s apartment complex obtained four judgments against him: SOR ¶ 1.b 
($210); SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,823); SOR ¶ 1.d ($132), and a non-SOR2 judgment for $2,385 
(which appears on his February 2009 credit report) (Tr. 50, 54-55; GE 4). Applicant 
contended the three SOR judgments were paid via a garnishment for $1,817 and the 
credit report alleging these multiple debt was erroneous (Tr. 51, 53-55; AE A; AE C at 
2). Applicant provided a garnishment writ for the SOR creditor in ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c and 1.d, 
showing a judgment for $1,817 plus costs and fees for a total of $1,871, dated June 12, 
 
2The non-SOR debt is not alleged in the SOR. I decline to draw any adverse inference against 
Applicant because of lack of notice. 
 
 
4 
2007 (AE A at 2). He provided sufficient corroboration to establish that a garnishment of 
$1,871 was paid (AE C at 2).  
 
Applicant disputed the debts in SOR ¶ 1.e ($2,204) and SOR ¶ 1.n ($3,331); 
however, he did not provide a copy of the documentation concerning his disputes (Tr. 
56, 63-65). He also disputed the rationale for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.v ($400) being on his 
credit report because it was over 10 years old (Tr. 69). A February 2009 credit report 
noted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e was disputed and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n did not appear on 
this credit report (Tr. 57, 65; GE 4). 
 
Applicant said he paid the college debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($321) (Tr. 58). Applicant 
was allowed to continue to attend college, manifesting that the college was satisfied the 
debt was paid or satisfied (Tr. 59). After his hearing, he provided proof of a payment 
made on March 20, 2009 (AE N at 9). 
 
Applicant owes a relative $16,800 for a judgment she obtained against him 
because of a dispute over residential rent he owed her (SOR ¶ 1.l; Tr. 71). Applicant 
withheld the rent because of lack of repairs (Tr. 71-72). His relative evicted him and 
obtained a judgment (Tr. 72). He asked his relative for a letter about the debt’s status 
for his security clearance hearing, and the relative declined because she claimed he 
had not paid her enough to warrant a letter of support about resolving the debt (Tr. 72-
76). He said he made some payments to the relative in cash and did not have proof of 
such payments (Tr. 75). 
 
Applicant said he made random payments over the years on most of his 
undisputed SOR debts, but the payments were not substantial (Tr. 47). He did not have 
proof of the payments at his hearing (Tr. 47). He said he started to address the debts in 
2006 and 2007 (Tr. 47, 57-58). He said if the creditor contacted him in the last two 
years, he has been making some payments to resolve the debt (Tr. 62, 65, 68, 70). On 
some accounts, such as the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.m ($2,040), he did not take any 
action (Tr. 63).  
 
Applicant’s largest debt is to the IRS for approximately $58,000 (SOR ¶ 1.q). IRS 
letters, dated March 23, 2009, show that he owes $51,192: (1) $13,544 for tax year 
1997 (AE D at 1); (2) $29,619 for tax year 1998 (AE D at 3); and (3) $8,029 for tax year 
2005 (AE D at 2). The tax lien and judgment resulted from his failure to pay sufficient 
taxes in 1995, 1997 and 2005 (Tr. 28-29; AE D). Applicant has been paying this IRS 
debt since January 2007 and he continues to pay $500 a month towards this debt in 
response to an IRS levy (Tr. 32, 33, 37; AE B at 1, 2; AE N at 3-5, 10, 12, 13, 14). Last 
year, Applicant paid $6,000 towards this IRS debt (Tr. 32; AE C at 1). Applicant’s 2007 
pay statement shows payment of $3,271 for this IRS debt (Tr. 38; AE C at 2).  
 
Applicant did not make payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r ($33,211) because it 
was more than seven years old (Tr. 67). He contended he was no longer responsible for 
this debt because it had “dropped off” of his credit report (Tr. 67). 
    
 
 
5 
Applicant provided a garnishment writ for a non-SOR creditor, showing a 
judgment for $853 plus costs and fees for a total of $1,021, dated June 5, 2007 (AE A at 
1). He provided a notice of satisfaction of this lien, dated September 18, 2007 (AE A at 
4). SOR creditor in ¶ 1.x lists a debt for $851. I assume these are the same debt and 
that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.x was paid through garnishment. 
 
In 2008, Applicant’s gross income was $103,019 (W2, AE C at 1). Applicant said 
that beginning in 2007, when he received a bill from a creditor, he would enter that debt 
into his electronic bill paying system (Tr. 27). Unfortunately, he did not bring the printout 
of his debts to his hearing (Tr. 27). He also sent each creditor a letter promising to make 
payments every month (Tr. 27). He promised to provide the printout later (Tr. 27-28). As 
indicated previously, Applicant said, every creditor who recently billed him receives an 
automatic check from Applicant, every pay period, anywhere between $5 and $20 (Tr. 
48). After his hearing he provided a four-page printout showing payments made to 
various creditors from May 7, 2008, to March 20, 2009 (AE N at 6-9). Most of the 
payments on the printout were to a telecommunications company and for gas and 
electric utilities, water, student loan and education costs at a university. He also 
frequently made payments to a loan servicing center, a reality company and about five 
collection agencies received one or two payments, mostly in February and March 2009 
(AE N at 8-9). Two SOR-listed creditors received one payment each (creditors in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a and 1.h). Of course, an SOR-listed creditor may have transferred a debt to one of 
the creditors on the list that is receiving a payment. At the hearing, I specified that 
Applicant should annotate the printout showing the SOR paragraph of the pertinent 
creditor (Tr. 79-80). However, the printout was devoid of references to the SOR 
paragraphs.  
 
In addition to his printout, Department counsel requested that Applicant provide 
monthly bank statements showing funds leaving his account and payments to particular 
SOR creditors (Tr. 80-81). Applicant responded that he could provide bank statements 
with annotations in the margins showing his payments to the various creditors listed in 
the SOR (Tr. 79-80, 88). However, Applicant did not provide any bank account 
statements after his hearing.  
 
Applicant said it was his impression that he was making monthly overpayments 
on his state tax debt of $9,100 (SOR ¶ 1.p) (Tr. 39-41). He provided a printout he 
generated showing payments on his state tax debt on February 6 and 20, 2009 and 
March 6 and 20, 2009 (Tr. 39-41; AE N at 7-9). The printout he generated apparently 
showed some transaction fees or minimal payments on these four dates, but it was 
unclear how much was paid on his state tax debt (AE N at 7-9).  
 
Applicant’s current gross income is $120,000 (Tr. 89). His monthly rent is $2,500 
(Tr. 89). I emphasized to Applicant the importance of providing proof that he was 
making payments to the SOR creditors prior to close of the record on April 21, 2009, 
and Applicant indicated he understood this requirement (Tr. 97-98).

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
an Applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
 
 
7 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR 
response and at his hearing. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations 
security concerns. His SOR listed 25 delinquent debts totaling about $155,000. He paid 
five SOR debts totaling about $3,300 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d, 1.h, and 1.x). He disputed two 
debts totaling about $5,500 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.n). He has a payment plan on his 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt and state tax debt; however, about $60,000 
remains to be paid (SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q). He has not made sufficient progress resolving 
about $80,000 of remaining delinquent debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i to 1.m, 1.o, 1.r to 
1.t, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.y) His financial difficulties began in the late 1990s and continue 
today. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
 
8 
                                           
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because his financial problems “occurred under such 
circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur;” however, there is some residual doubt 
about whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent SOR debts and is 
making adequate steps to do so. He realizes the importance of avoiding delinquent debt 
and promised to make a greater effort to keep his debts current.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged due in 
part to his marital problems and stress from his daughter’s illness. He has six children, 
and lives in a high cost area. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. He does 
not receive full credit because many of his debts arose years ago, and he made little 
progress on most of them until his pay was garnished, judgments, liens or levies were 
filed against him. He established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances 
with respect to the debts he actually paid, through compliance with the garnishment 
orders, or through reaching settlements with creditors, such as the IRS.3  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant is a very intelligent, well organized, goal 
oriented person. He does not really need financial counseling or advice to resolve his 
debts. He manages to make payments on most of his non-SOR debts. Applicant has 
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his 
debts current. 
 
 
9 
                                           
taken positive action to pay five SOR debts. He is making payments of $500 monthly on 
his IRS debt. He is also making some payments on his state tax debt, and his $460 debt 
(SOR ¶ 1.u). He did not prove he had agreements with most of his creditors to accept 
minimal payments to resolve the other SOR debts. There are some positive “indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He understands the security 
implications of delinquent debt and there are positive signs that he will avoid future 
delinquent debt. He has also established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because 
Applicant showed some good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR debts.    
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies because Applicant disputed the debts in SOR ¶ 1.e ($2,204) 
and SOR ¶ 1.n ($3,331). Although he did not provide a copy of the documentation 
concerning these two disputes, his February 2009 credit report noted the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.e was disputed and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n did not appear on this credit report. He also 
disputed the rationale for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.v ($400) being on his credit report 
because it was over 10 years old. However, the age of the debt and whether or not it is 
on a credit report, without more, is not a valid basis for asserting mitigation under AG ¶ 
20(e) for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.v.  
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His payment of five SOR debts, his payment 
plans to resolve three debts, and his dispute of two debts, are simply inadequate to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Applicant has not adequately 
addressed about 15 delinquent SOR debts, totaling about $80,000. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for his support to his 
country and his family. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the 
Department of Defense, his employer and that he is an honorable person. There were 
no allegations of security violations. He does not have any arrests or convictions. 
Applicant is a high school graduate, and has three years of college. He was not 
sophisticated in the area of finance, and made mistakes years ago, and his debts 
became delinquent. Stress from marital problems, support of his six children, and his 
daughter’s medical problems contributed to his financial woes. He understands how to 
avoid future delinquent debts. He paid several non-SOR debts and is current on many 
of his financial responsibilities. He paid five SOR debts, $10,000 towards his IRS debt in 
the last two years, and is making payments on his state tax debt and one other SOR 
debt. He is making some progress on his way to establishing a meaningful track record 
of debt repayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). He is 
motivated to have a successful career as an employee of a Department of Defense 
contractor, to pay his delinquent debts and to have his security clearance approved. 
These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. He began to have 
financial difficulties in the late 1990s, when several debts became delinquent. On 
November 7, 2007, he received DOHA interrogatories and on January 12, 2009, he 
responded to the SOR. He had ample opportunity to contact more of his SOR creditors 
and to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. Of the 25 SOR debts, 
totaling about $156,000, he provided documentary proof that he paid about $10,000 to 
the IRS and about $2,500 as required by two garnishments. He paid one non-
garnishment, non-tax debt for $321 (SOR ¶ 1.h). He is evidently making payments on 
his state tax debt, and another state-related debt (SOR ¶ 1.u, $460). Applicant’s current 
gross income is $120,000, and was over $100,000 the previous year. He made 
insufficient progress over the last 18 months to resolve his delinquent debts, even 
though he had steady employment and ample opportunity to contact his creditors and 
provide documentation. He provided voluminous documentation showing his superb 
 
 
11 
background in information technology and software development. He knows how to 
generate a comprehensive, thorough report showing his financial situation and to 
document progress in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. He was on clear 
notice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more so after he received the 
SOR that he needed to show substantial progress in the resolution of his delinquent 
debts; however, he made insufficient effort to accomplish this security responsibility.      
 
After Applicant’s delinquent SOR debts are paid, resolved or otherwise satisfied, 
and after a reasonable period of time without additional delinquent debts, (assuming no 
other disqualifying conditions surface), Applicant’s access to classified information 
should be approved. He needs to provide documentary evidence, such as bank 
statements, or other receipts, to corroborate resolution of his debts. He needs some 
time after his SOR debts are paid to reestablish a track record of financial responsibility.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set 
forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of 
the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent 
factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities 
under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government’s 
case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified 
information at this time.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
