Decision

HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant’s 
statement of reasons (SOR) lists a March 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and four 
delinquent debts, totaling $34,761. Applicant settled and paid three of the four 
delinquent SOR debts and the remaining SOR debt is in a payment plan. Clearance is 
granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 19, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Sensitive Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86) (GE 1). On November 28, 2008, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary 
decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, citing security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive) and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On January 2, 2009, DOHA received Applicant’s undated response to the SOR 
(GE 7). On January 12, 2009, Applicant requested a hearing using email (Hearing 
Exhibit I; Transcript (Tr.) 12-14). On March 6, 2009, Department Counsel was prepared 
to proceed. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. On March 20, 2009, 
DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 13, 2009. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-4) (Tr. 18), and Applicant offered six 
exhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-F). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 (Tr. 22), 
and AEs A-F (Tr. 21-22). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the 
hearing notice (GEs 5-7). I received the transcript on April 21, 2009. I held the record 
open until April 23, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence (Tr. 47-49, 
51-52). On April 23, 2009, I received additional evidence (AEs H-K), and these 
documents were admitted without objection. I closed the record on April 23, 2009.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in 
the SOR (GE 7; Tr. 14). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After 
a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings 
of fact.   
 
Applicant is 50 years old (Tr. 4, 23). In 1987, he received his bachelor’s degree in 
computer science (Tr. 4, 23). He has worked for a government contractor for the last 15 
months as a software engineer (Tr. 24). He has never held a security clearance and he 
is currently seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 24). He is not married and does not have 
any children (Tr. 25). 
  
Financial considerations 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists four delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
to 1.d), totaling $34,761. Applicant’s financial problems were caused by unemployment 
(Tr. 28-32). Applicant was unemployed for approximately one year before he declared 
bankruptcy in 2001 (Tr. 26). Prior to becoming unemployed his salary was about 
$55,000 annually (Tr. 27). In March 2001, Applicant filed for bankruptcy because he had 
about $20,000 in delinquent debt, and in June 2001, Applicant’s debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (SOR ¶ 1.e, Tr. 25, 27-28).  
  
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
Applicant was employed from September 2001 until September 2006. He was 
unemployed from September 2006 until February 2007 (Tr. 28-29, 31). He was 
employed until August 2007, and then unemployed from August to December 2007 (Tr. 
32). He has been employed from January 2007 to the present with his current employer 
(Tr. 32).     
 
Applicant established through his hearing statement and the documents that he 
provided that three of his SOR debts were settled and paid or paid in full. One debt is in 
a payment plan. He waited until shortly before his hearing to resolve his SOR debts 
because he was nervous about the economy and did not want to commit substantial 
funds to his delinquent debts until he had amassed more funds, and he wanted to be 
more confident about retention of his employment (Tr. 46-47). The resolution of his SOR 
debts is more specifically described as follows:  
 
(1) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($8,312) is a credit card debt (Tr. 36).  On February 
20, 2009, it was settled for $3,400 and paid in a lump sum with a check (Tr. 36-37; AE 
B, E); 
 
(2) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,798) related to purchase of advertising for 
Applicant’s business (Tr. 40, 42). It was paid in full on March 19, 2009 (Tr. 40; AE J);  
 
(3) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($9,651) is a credit card debt (Tr. 34). On March 5, 
2009, it was settled for $6,000, which Applicant paid in a lump sum with a check for 
$6,000 (Tr. 35-36; AE A, D); and 
 
(4) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($15,000) is for an installment loan (Tr. 37). The 
amount of the debt has increased to $19,300 (Tr. 38; AE F). Applicant has a payment 
plan with payments for the first year of $100 monthly beginning April 15, 2009 (Tr. 39; 
AE K). The payments gradually increase to $600 monthly in the fifth year (Tr. 39). 
Applicant does not have to pay interest on the debt (Tr. 39; AE K).  
 
Applicant’s current annual salary is $99,000 (Tr. 43). His net salary is about 
$60,000 annually (Tr. 43). He does not have a 401K or retirement plan (Tr. 44). He has 
about $5,000 in his checking account, and $35,204 in his savings account, as of March 
17, 2009 (Tr. 44-45; AE I). He has one credit card and he pays off the balance every 
month (Tr. 45). He is current on his state and federal taxes (Tr. 46).  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
 
 
4 
 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SOR response and at his 
hearing. In 2001, he fell behind on some of his debts because of unemployment. In 
June 2001, his debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In 
2006 and 2007, four additional debts, totaling $34,761, became delinquent due to 
unemployment. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
 
6 
 
                                           
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. He did not dispute the legitimacy of any of his delinquent SOR debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG ¶ 
20(a) because his delinquent debts also “occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  He resolved three of four delinquent debts and the 
remaining debt is in a payment plan. 
 
Applicant receives full credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial problems 
initially resulted because of unemployment. Unemployment caused his financial 
problems in 2001, which he used bankruptcy to resolve his debts. In the last two years, 
he was unemployed from September 2006 to February 2007 and from August to 
December 2007. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and paid three of his 
four SOR debts prior to his hearing.2 His remaining SOR debt is in a payment plan.    
 
AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies. Applicant paid (or settled and paid) three of four of his 
delinquent debts, and the remaining debt is in a payment plan. There are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He understands the 
security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent 
debt. He has also established mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed good 
faith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts.    
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                            
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts.  He should have maintained contact with his 
creditors, keeping them apprised of his financial progress.  Nevertheless, his resolution 
of three of four SOR debts, and his entry into a payment plan on the remaining debt is 
adequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 2001, Applicant’s 
debts became delinquent because of his unemployment. In 2001, he utilized a Chapter 
7 bankruptcy to eliminate his delinquent debts. By the end of 2007, he had four 
delinquent debts, totalling $34,761. He failed to keep his accounts current and negotiate 
lesser payments when his income decreased, showing some financial irresponsibility 
and lack of judgment. When he returned to full employment in December 2007, he did 
not aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. His history of delinquent debt raises 
sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. Applicant is a law-abiding citizen. His 
unemployment is the source of all of his financial problems. Ultimately, he paid or 
 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

settled three of four delinquent SOR debts. His remaining SOR debt is in a payment 
plan. His remaining debts are all current. He has about $35,000 in his savings account. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is 50 years old. He has earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science. He 
had worked for a government contractor for the last fifteen months and his annual salary 
from the contractor is now $99,000. He made mistakes, and his debts became 
delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt payments by actually paying or settling 
and paying three of his four delinquent SOR debts, and the remaining debt is in a 
payment plan. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. He has 
demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the 
Department of Defense as a defense contractor. After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
