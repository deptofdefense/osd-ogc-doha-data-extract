Decision

GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 1, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline 
F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on an unspecified date. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated October 13, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and the case was 
assigned to me on February 6, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 5, 2009, 
and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 25, 2009. 
 
During the hearing, four Government exhibits and eight Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) was received on April 2, 2009. 
 
The record was kept open until April 6, 2009, to enable the parties to supplement 
the record.  Department Counsel chose not to make any further submissions, but 
Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on that date, submitted two additional 
documents (marked as Applicant Exhibits I and J) which were admitted into evidence 
without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a majority of the factual allegations 
in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.). He denied the one remaining allegation. 
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain a SECRET security clearance. He has held a variety of security clearances, 
including SECRET and TOP SECRET, since about March 1967.1 His marriage to his 
first wife ended with her accidental death in 1979.2 He and his current wife have been 
married nearly 30 years, and they have seven living children.3 He served on active duty 
with the U.S. Army from 1967 through 1970, and was assigned to communications 
support at the White House.4 Applicant has been gainfully employed by the same

defense contractor since April 1997, and currently serves as a Senior Principal Software 
Engineer.5 He is also the founder/president/investor of a duly chartered corporation 
holding exclusive rights to certain intellectual property.6  
 
In 1997, in conjunction with his new employment, Applicant relocated his family 
and household from one state to another, putting his old house on the market and 
renting at his new location.7  Because of the financial strain of not selling his residence 
for about one year, he started to fall behind in routine payments. One creditor sued him 
and obtained a judgment, causing additional financial strain.8 In April 1999, upon the 
advice of an attorney, Applicant sought relief and filed for voluntary bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7.9 In August 1999, with assets of only $10,870, Applicant’s liabilities of 
$59,165 were discharged.10 Although he has not subsequently affirmed any of his 
discharged debts, Applicant felt remorse over the bankruptcy and hopes to pay back 
those creditors when he is able to do so.11 
 
 Following his bankruptcy, Applicant created spreadsheets and paid close 
attention to his finances.12 Additionally, because of early successes involving his part-
time technology development activities, in August 2007, he established two corporations 
to formalize those business activities.13 His objective was to “provide an avenue of 
work” when he retires in 2014.14 The two corporations obtained financing from 
investors, including Applicant, and conducted legitimate business 
 
Applicant established an account with one creditor, in his own name, but in 
reality, it was a business account. The creditor’s product was used for testing his 
corporate products.15 Periodic payments, totaling about $3,000, were routinely made 
until early 2008, when they ceased.16 In May 2008, the account, with an outstanding

balance of $1,039, was sent to collection.17 On March 23, 2009, following negotiations 
with the creditor, Applicant was offered a settlement opportunity.18 The following day, he 
paid the creditor $870, and the account was considered “settled in full.”19  
 
In about 2003, prior to the onset of his most recent financial difficulties, Applicant 
opened a credit card account and used it for normal personal expenses.20 He 
maintained the account in a current status until sometime in 2007.21 However, the 
financial demands of his family, described further below, and his growing business 
became overwhelming and he was unable to continue making timely payments.22 As a 
result, the account was closed by the creditor, placed for collection, and eventually 
charged off in July 2008.23 The unpaid balance at that time was $2,973.24 In May 2008, 
Applicant had made a $416 payment.25 Despite the account having been charged off, in 
November 2008, the creditor obtained a $3,067.85 judgment against Applicant.26 
Applicant made a $1,000 payment in December 2008.27 On March 4, 2009, Applicant 
was offered a discounted settlement offer, and he accepted it.28 On March 24, 2009, he 
paid the agreed balance of $2,168,29 and the account was “settled in full.”30 
 
Applicant opened a credit card account with Visa in 2004, and used it for normal 
personal expenses.31 He maintained the account in a current status until sometime in 
2007.32 As with his other accounts, his financial condition made it difficult to continue

making timely payments.33 The account was first sold by the issuing bank to another 
bank, and then charged off.34 Applicant ignored correspondence, including bills, from 
the second bank, believing them to be advertisements since he did not knowingly have 
an account with the second bank.35 As a result, he simply threw them away, 
unopened.36 In about September 2007, the second bank called Applicant’s residence 
and advised his wife of the situation.37 She negotiated a payoff arrangement with the 
creditor, agreeing to make $600 monthly payments towards the $3,750 balance.38 
However, instead of abiding by the agreement, the bank withdrew the entire balance at 
one time rather than only the monthly payment.39 Applicant filed an appeal, which was 
rejected, and then a dispute, which he won after the authorities listened to the telephone 
tape of the agreement.40 Although Applicant had the funds returned to his account, he 
remained livid over the bank’s actions, and when he was offered a settlement of $2,200, 
he rejected it.41 The account, with a reported balance of $5,765, was eventually placed 
for collection.42 
 
On March 17, 2009, a representative for the creditor made a demand for 
payment on the account, with a reported balance of $5,454.50, but indicated he was 
willing to accept three monthly payments of $1,820.43 Applicant was reluctant to agree 
to that amount unless he had the means to do so.44 On March 30, 2009, Applicant 
agreed to make monthly payments of $1,092.39 until the balance, now $5,464.21, was 
paid in full.45 That same day, he paid the creditor $1,100.46

Applicant purchased a residence in April 2004, financing the entire $350,000 
purchase price.47 His monthly payments of $2,785 far exceeded the amount set forth in 
his “verbal agreements” with the loan officer prior to closing.48 His efforts to rectify the 
disparity were ignored by the bank and he was forced to live with the terms of the 
written loan agreement.49 Applicant and his family resided in the residence until January 
2007.50 During that period, the value of the residence first increased to about $520,000, 
and then plummeted downward.51 In May 2006, Applicant placed the residence on the 
market, initially listing it at $485,000, but subsequently reducing the asking price in 
increments down to about $400,000.52 Despite his best efforts to sell the residence, and 
with the competing efforts of neighbors’ whose homes were also on the market, he 
never received an offer.53 
 
In January 2007, Applicant’s family relocated to a rental home in a larger 
metropolitan city within the same state where his corporations were located so they 
could perform necessary and timely work for those corporations and their clients.54 He 
remained at home during the workweek, near his employer, commuting to the new 
family residence on weekends.55 Unable to handle two house payments, in about June 
2007, he stopped making his mortgage payments.56 In November 2007, the property 
was foreclosed and scheduled to be sold in February 2009 at a trustee’s sale.57 Since 
the foreclosure, Applicant has never received any notice from the bank indicating a 
deficiency.58 He denied the SOR allegation and contends that the account is closed, 
and that there is no balance owing.59 Department Counsel was offered the opportunity 
to supplement the record regarding state law pertaining to deficiencies in such a 
situation to determine if there is an Anti-Deficiency Statute in the state, but no such 
submission was made. In the absence of evidence indicating an actual legal deficiency,

or contradicting Applicant’s contentions, I find insufficient evidence to establish the 
existence of a deficiency balance. 
 
With the exception of his one delinquent Visa debt, on which he is currently 
making payments under an agreement, and his recent home foreclosure, Applicant’s 
finances are otherwise unremarkable, and there is no evidence of other financial issues 
or difficulties. According to his most recent Personal Financial Statement, completed in 
May 2008, Applicant had a monthly sum of $340 for discretionary expenses.60 That 
amount should have increased now that he has paid off the one debt listed as a monthly 
payment. He currently earns a biweekly $5,192.61 Applicant’s corporations owe him 
approximately $280,000 in back wages and reimbursable expenses, which he expects 
to start drawing once an anticipated contract with an investor is signed in April 2009.62 
 
The financial demands of Applicant’s growing business have been a factor in his 
financial difficulties, but also prominent was the issue of the demands of Applicant’s 
family. One 24-year-old unemployed son has resided with Applicant since April 2007; a 
28-year-old son, whose wife deserted him, has resided with his three young children, in 
Applicant’s residence since March 2008; a 22-year-old daughter and her unemployed 
husband rely on Applicant for financial assistance; and his 73-year-old mother-in-law 
has resided with Applicant since December 2007. Some of them contribute money.63 
Despite his financial problems, Applicant’s work performance has apparently not 
suffered for he recently earned a bonus of $5,091.51.64 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”65 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”66

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”67 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.68  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.  Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.”69 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”70 Thus, nothing 
67 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit 
reports, answer to the SOR, his answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including 
his testimony, presented during the hearing. The Government has established AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c).   
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ 
In addition, when “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” AG ¶ 20(b) may apply. Evidence that Athe 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating 
under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
 
10 
                                      
 
                                                          
debts.@71 Also, AG & 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue” may apply. 
 
As noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial 
considerations in the security clearance context is that “[f]ailure or inability to live within 
one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-
control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. . . .” 
(emphasis supplied).  But these are not “normal” times, for the world in general, and the 
United States in particular, is faced with economic chaos, plummeting real estate 
values, tightened credit, corporate layoffs and bankruptcies, diminished savings and 
retirement accounts, financial institution failures and takeovers, and soaring 
unemployment.  
   
We no longer think in terms of millions or even billions of dollars when describing 
the U.S. national debt, for in this new world order, trillions of dollars have become the 
new standard.  We are in economic turmoil, with posturing and corporate greed 
becoming increasingly common; where credit is largely unavailable; where thousands, if 
not hundreds of thousands, of otherwise innocent bystanders have lost their homes to 
foreclosure and their jobs to these uncertain times; and where the popular responses 
are to point the fingers of blame and invest unprecedented amounts of money to restart 
the economy and reverse the recession.  
   
This economic catastrophe appears to be the “perfect storm” where the 
confluence of greed, irresponsible risk-taking, regulatory failure and inadequate 
oversight, malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance on the part of some segments 
of corporate America, our financial institutions, some creditors, and political institutions, 
have resulted in unintentional consequences or “collateral damage” to the innocents – 
millions of Americans, especially the American taxpayer.  In the past, these 
unconscionable actions were overlooked in the race for enrichment.   
   
71 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

To determine if an applicant is such an unintentional victim or a willing participant 
and complicit, in an otherwise unwise or irresponsible monetary scheme, or a person 
with poor self-control or lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual’s original 
intentions and actions is essential. In this instance, since his 1999 bankruptcy, 
Applicant’s financial history and actions reveal no evidence of poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. To the contrary, his 
goals were to insure the success of his corporation; to protect his family; and pay his 
creditors. He originally obtained a mortgage with an affordable monthly payment, and 
when the mortgage payments adjusted upward, he set out to sell the residence. This 
same strategy was employed by thousands of Americans. His efforts were responsible 
and disciplined. Applicant’s current situation was caused by other factors, including a 
possible error by his mortgage lender.  
   
In January 2007, Applicant’s family relocated to a rental home near his 
corporations so they could perform necessary work for those corporations. He remained 
at home during the workweek, near his employer, commuting to the new family 
residence on weekends. Unable to handle two house payments, in about June 2007, he 
stopped making his mortgage payments, and in November 2007, the property was 
foreclosed and scheduled to be sold in February 2009 at a trustee’s sale. Since that 
projected foreclosure sale, Applicant has received no deficiency notices, and there is no 
evidence of a deficiency. This situation presents an interesting conundrum, for after the 
foreclosure, the sale ensued, under state law, Applicant may not be liable for either the 
unpaid mortgage or the deficiency, if there was one, and the lien holder would be limited 
to the property. Under Arizona law, there is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency 
Statute,72 which states in relevant part: 
 
If trust property of two and one-half acres or less which is limited to and 
utilized for either a single one-family or a single two-family dwelling is sold 
pursuant to the trustee's power of sale, no action may be maintained to 
recover any difference between the amount obtained by sale and the 
amount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses.   
 
Considering the unusual circumstances of today’s economy in general, and the 
series of events involving Applicant’s mortgage loan and subsequent inability to sell his 
residence, in particular, Applicant’s actions and his otherwise generally average, 
unremarkable, financial status, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
issues have been resolved and are now largely under control. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively, timely, and responsibly to resolve his 
delinquent debts. Those delinquent debts were “a continuing course of conduct” under 
72 Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 33-814 (G) (2001); See also, Baker v. Gardner,  160 Ariz. 98, 770 P.2d 766 (Ariz. 1988). 
Arizona’s anti-deficiency statutes prohibit a secured lender from suing a homeowner who borrowed money on those 
types of loans protected by the anti-deficiency statutes for damages beyond recovery of the secured property.

the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence.73 Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(a) 
because his financial problems “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” Applicant attempted to balance the needs of family and business with 
those of timely payment of creditors, and he was, at least for a time, unsuccessful. He 
has now paid off two creditors and commenced payments to a third. AG ¶ 20(e) applies 
because he disputed one of the SOR debts and there is no evidence of a continuing 
deficiency obligation. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies because Applicant’s financial situation was exacerbated by 
the downward spiral of the global economy; his inability to sell his residence because of 
an unexpectedly poor housing market; the desertion of his son and grandchildren by his 
daughter-in-law; the needs of his growing business; one of the debts was business-
related; and the lack of employment experienced by two sons. Initially, he lacked the 
income to keep his business afloat, his family secure, and pay some of his debts, but he 
eventually commenced negotiations with creditors and started paying his SOR debts. 
While it may have taken some time, Applicant eventually established that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances.74  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) applies because he started addressing those delinquencies when he 
received his annual bonus.  There are now “clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control.” He understands the security implications of his earlier 
inaction pertaining to delinquent debt and intends to scrupulously avoid future 
delinquent debt. 
 
He has also established mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because Applicant showed 
good faith in his efforts to resolve his SOR debts.  He has established a reasonable plan 
to continue to do so, and has already taken care of all but one of them, and that one is 
currently being addressed under an agreement with the creditor.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
73 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 16, 2002)). 
 
74 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my analysis below.      
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. As noted above, 
part of his financial difficulties arose from diverting assets to his business. Applicant also 
apparently ignored his debts, and, as a result, several accounts became delinquent and 
were either “charged off” or placed for collection.  
 The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant attempted to balance the needs of family and business with those of timely 
payment of creditors, and he was, at least for a time, unsuccessful. When he had 
sufficient money to do both, he directed his efforts to paying off his delinquent debts. 
There is no evidence of any security violation, and to the contrary, he is apparently 
considered a valued employee, justifying a substantial bonus. He is a law-abiding 
citizen. He intends to satisfy the one remaining debt in the near future. His personal 
payment plan is in place and being followed, and he has no new delinquent debts. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating:75 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
75 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
14 
                                      
 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant made mistakes, and debts became delinquent. There is, however, 
simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a “meaningful track 
record” of debt payments by actually paying most of his delinquent SOR debts, setting 
up arrangements with the one remaining creditor, and setting up his personal plan to 
resolve that remaining debt. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations 
security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
he is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
