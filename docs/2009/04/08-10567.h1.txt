HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has an extensive history of drug abuse. He failed to mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 8, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (2008 SF 86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) (GE 
11). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
On February 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and 
requested a hearing (GE 12). Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 16, 
2009, and the case was assigned to me that same day. At the hearing held on April 17, 
2009, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits (GEs 1-8) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19). 
There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-8 (Tr. 19). I held the record open until 
April 24, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence (Tr. 14). After the 
hearing, Applicant provided six more exhibits, which were admitted without objection 
(AEs A-F). I also admitted the hearing notice and amended notice (GEs 9-10), the SOR 
(GE 11), and Applicant’s SOR response (GE 12). I received the transcript on April 24, 
2009.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (GE 
12). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is 28 years old (Tr. 6, 28).2 He received his high school diploma in 
1998 (Tr. 22). He earned a bachelor’s of science degree in biology in December 2002 
(Tr. 6, 22). He has never served in the military (Tr. 6). He has never married. He has 
never held a security clearance (Tr. 6). He has never been charged with any felony, any 
firearms or explosives offense, or any offense related to alcohol or drugs. He has not 
been arrested or charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type offenses in the last 
seven years, except for a 2002 arrest for failure to leave (GE 2 at 5). Later the failure to 
leave charge was dismissed (GE 2 at 5). In the last seven years, he has not had any 
debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid 
liens. 
 
From 2000 to 2005, he had part-time employment at a university (Tr. 22-23). 
From 2005 to March 2006, he worked for a corporation as an environmental engineer 
(Tr. 23). He was unemployed from March to October 2006 (Tr. 24). From October 2006 
to March 2007, he worked as an environmental consultant for another firm (Tr. 24-25).

otherwise.

In March 2007, Applicant began working as an environmental scientist for his 
current employer, a government contractor (Tr. 25). He performs environmental site 
assessments, and collects groundwater and soil samples for testing and classification 
(Tr. 26). He did not believe his continued employment with the contractor was 
contingent on approval of his security clearance (Tr. 54-55). 
 
Illegal Drug Possession and Sale 
 
 Applicant used marijuana approximately 65 times from about September 1998 to 
about April 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. 26-28; GE 12), hallucinogenics (mushrooms) about 
five times from about August 2001 to about February 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.c; Tr. 31-33; GE 2 
at 2; GE 3 at 3; GE 12),3 and cocaine about six times from about June 2001 to about 
November 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. 36-37; GE 12). He sold a small amount of marijuana for 
about $5 on two occasions (SOR ¶ 1.e; Tr. 41; GE 3 at 3; GE 12). He used illegal drugs 
because of peer pressure and to experiment (Tr. 54).  
 
Applicant used marijuana approximately once a week, and sometimes every 
other week throughout his years of college attendance (Tr. 27). After he graduated from 
college in 2002, he continued to use marijuana with less frequency, perhaps once a 
month or even less frequently (Tr. 27-28). He ended his marijuana use in April 2008 (Tr. 
26). 
 
Applicant used steroids every other day for four of five weeks, during two time 
periods from about October 2005 to about May 2006, while he was playing semi-
professional football (SOR ¶ 1.b; Tr. 31-33, 41; GE 3 at 3-4). He did not have a 
prescription authorizing steroid use (Tr. 42). He did not use steroids after May 2006 (Tr. 
33).  
 
Applicant was offered cocaine as recently as the fall of 2008 from a friend he has 
known since high school (Tr. 38). He refused the offer of cocaine (Tr. 38). He continues 
to have occasional contact with the friend (Tr. 39).  
 
Applicant did not have any problems at work because of his illegal drug use (Tr. 
43). He did use illegal drugs at work or during lunch breaks (Tr. 44). He passed every 
drug test at his employment and the tests did not detect any traces of illegal substances 
in his system (Tr. 44-46).4 He provided negative drug-test results for urinalysis tests on 
September 21, 2007 (AE D), March 19, 2008 (AE E), and November 20, 2008 (GE F). 
Applicant disclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application and to an 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator (GE 1, section 24; GE 3 at 3). He 
continues to associate with friends or associates, who he knows are or were illegal drug 
users (Tr. 48). Generally, his friends and associates rarely use illegal drugs in his 
 
3He was unsure about the drug in the mushrooms, or “shrooms”, but conceded it was a 
hallucinogenic substance that he took to feel a drug-like effect (Tr. 33-34; GE 12). 
 
4One employer-administered drug test was positive for the presence of a prescription-authorized 
drug (Tr. 47-48, 58). Because he was authorized use of the prescription drug by his dentist, this test result 
raises no adverse security concerns.

presence; however, the most recent illegal drug usage by others in his presence 
occurred in a friend’s apartment on a balcony about four months before his hearing (Tr. 
49-53).   
 
Applicant has never received counseling for drug abuse (Tr. 53; GE 3 at 4). He 
emphasized that his drug use was part of the process of growing up and 
experimentation (Tr. 62). He was not dependent on illegal drugs (Tr. 62). He is tested at 
work for drugs (Tr. 63). He does not intend to ever use illegal drugs again (Tr. 54, 63; 
GE 2 at 2).    
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
an Applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.

Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) with respect to the allegations set 
forth in the SOR. 
 
Drug Involvement 
 
AG ¶ 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: 
 
[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
AG ¶ 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying 
conditions raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: “any 
drug abuse,”5 and “illegal drug possession or sale or distribution.”   
 
AG ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) apply because Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, 
mushrooms (psilocybin), or steroids (without a prescription) from September 1998 to 
 
5AG ¶ 24(b) defines “drug abuse” as “the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner 
that deviates from approved medical direction.” 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
April 2008.6 The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG ¶ 25 are not applicable. He 
disclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application, to an OPM 
investigator, and at his hearing. He used illegal drugs primarily because he was curious 
about the effects of the drugs and his peers and friends were using illegal drugs. He 
possessed these illegal drugs before he used them. He sold marijuana on two 
occasions. 
   
  AG ¶ 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating 
conditions:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  
 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance 
for any violation. 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; 
and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, 
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional. 
 
6AG ¶ 24(a) defines “drugs” as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: 
 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other 
similar substances. 
 
Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. § 
812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. 
Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). Mushrooms are the street 
name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Sch. I Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, 
351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Sch. I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) 
controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) 
(cocaine). The adverse medical consequences of use of these illegal drugs are described in detail in GEs 
4-8). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
 Concerning AG ¶ 26(a), there are no “bright line” rules for determining when 
conduct is “recent.” The determination must be based “on a careful evaluation of the 
totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.” ISCR Case No. 02-
24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR 
Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana 
occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence 
shows “a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,” 
then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates 
“changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or 
rehabilitation.”7 
 
Applicant’s last marijuana use was on April 2008, about 12 months prior to his 
hearing. AG ¶ 26(a) partially applies. His overall illegal drug use lasted approximately 
ten years (1998 to 2008), and involved numerous uses of marijuana, cocaine, 
mushrooms, and steroids. AG ¶ 26(a) cannot be fully applied because his past drug use 
was so extensive and is too recent. There remains some doubt about his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.8 He has abstained from drug use for about 
12 months, and he recognizes the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse. These 
actions create some certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. However, 
more time is needed to increase confidence that his illegal drug possession and use will 
not recur and to fully establish his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment 
with respect to abstaining from illegal drug use.   
 
7 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the 
absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge 
excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug 
use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal 
Board stated:  
 
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage 
of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel 
the administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of 
law, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply 
that mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR 
Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a 
rational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at 
alcohol rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency 
analysis of an administrative judge stating: 
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of 
improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security 
clearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year 
from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal 
purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
 
8In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an 
unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use 
was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.

AG ¶ 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse 
illegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using 
associates and contacts. He has refused offers to possess and use illegal drugs.  He 
continues to associate with some current or former drug users. He has broken or 
reduced the prevalence of his patterns of drug abuse, and he has changed his own life 
with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse for about 12 months. 
However, he did not provide “a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of 
clearance for any violation.”9 AG ¶ 26(b) does not fully apply.  
 
AG ¶¶ 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse 
prescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. The 
marijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, and steroids were never prescribed for him. He did not 
satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and 
aftercare requirements. 
  
In sum, Applicant ended his marijuana abuse in April 2008, about 12 months ago. 
Aside from his marijuana use, all of his other illegal drug use ended in May 2006 or 
earlier.10 His non-marijuana use is not recent. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs 
are evident. He understands the adverse results from drug abuse.11 He has, however, 
 
9Even if he had provided such a statement, insufficient time has elapsed since his most recent 
illegal drug use to warrant full application of this mitigating condition.  
 
10The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative 
judge considered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were 
mitigated. ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). Here, Applicant used 
hallucinogenics until February 2002, cocaine until November 2001, steroids until May 2006, and 
marijuana until April 2008. His repeated abuse of these particular drugs is relevant in the whole person 
analysis, but individually, as listed in the SOR, the abuse of three of the four illegal drugs more than three 
years ago is insufficiently aggravating to cause denial of his clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 
(App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board explained it is the overall conduct that determines whether a 
clearance should be granted stating: 
 
The Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a 
reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category 
of incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the “evidence as a 
whole” and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, 
866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is 
missing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a 
Judge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge’s 
piecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of ¶ 
E2.2 of the Directive.

11Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse 
health, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for 
remaining drug free.

not shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of marijuana abstinence to eliminate 
drug involvement as a bar to his access to classified information.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
was relatively young and immature when he began using illegal drugs. He stopped 
using illegal drugs in April 2008. In 2008, he frankly and candidly admitted his extensive 
history of drug use on his 2008 security clearance application. He subsequently 
admitted his drug use to an OPM investigator, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, 
on his SOR response, and at his hearing. He knows the consequences of drug abuse. 
Applicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no 
evidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty 
or that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and good work 
performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors 
evidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his employment after his 
security clearance was called into question. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain 
from drug use, and avoids future offenses he will have future potential for access to 
classified information.  
 
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial.  
Applicant had a problem with drug abuse from 1998 to 2008. Applicant used 
hallucinogenics until February 2002, cocaine until November 2001, steroids until May 
2006, and marijuana until April 2008. He used illegal drugs on numerous occasions. He 
has not received drug counseling or treatment. He continues to associate with some 
friends or associates that used and may currently be using illegal drugs. He was offered 
cocaine by a friend in the last 12 months. His abstinence from drug abuse for 12 months

is an insufficient period of time to mitigate drug involvement security concerns. His 
numerous decisions to possess and use illegal drugs over a ten-year period were 
knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully 
responsible for his conduct. These offenses show a serious lack of judgment and a 
failure to abide by the law. Such judgment lapses are relevant in the context of security 
requirements. His misconduct raises a serious security concern, and a security 
clearance is not warranted at this time. 
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to drug involvement primarily because his marijuana use is 
still too recent.  See n. 10, supra (explaining why all misconduct must be considered as 
part of whole person concept).    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”12 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  
 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b to 1.e:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
