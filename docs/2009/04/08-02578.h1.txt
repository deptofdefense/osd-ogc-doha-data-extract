Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on 
September 6, 2007. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
On January 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 9, 2009. On 
February 10, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for March 4, 
2009. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered seven exhibits which 
were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 – 7. Applicant testified and offered four 
exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The record was held 
open until March 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He timely 
 
2 
 
 
submitted a nine-page document which was admitted as AE E. The transcript was 
received on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, 
and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, , 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w. 
He denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.n, and 1.r.  
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old equipment specialist employed with a Department of 
Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his company since 
October 2006. He is a Desert Storm veteran. He served on active duty in the United 
States Navy from November 6, 1997, to October 6, 1991. He separated at the rank of 
Q-M 3 with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance in the past. He is 
engaged to be married and lives with his fiancé. He has two children from a prior 
marriage, a daughter age 7, and a son age 13. (Tr at 6-8, 47; Gov 1; AE C; AE E at 9)  
 
On September 6, 2007, Applicant completed a questionnaire for sensitive 
positions (SF-86), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1) A subsequent 
background investigation revealed that Applicant had 23 delinquent accounts, an 
approximate total balance of $16,625. The delinquent accounts include:  a $189 medical

October 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 2 at 4; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2-3; Gov 7 at 4); 
and a $20 medical account placed for collection in January 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 2 at 4; 
Gov 4 at 3; Gov 7 at 7).

Applicant’s financial problems began around 2002. In December 2002, he injured 
his knee on the job. He underwent three knee surgeries. He and his wife agreed that he 
would stay at home and look after the children and she would work. This allowed time 
for his knee to be rehabilitated. He and his wife divorced in October 2004. (Tr at 38-40)  
  
In 2004, Applicant moved in with his brother. He was unemployed between 
December 2002 to February 2005.  In February 2005, he moved to where he currently 
resides and got a job driving a truck. In March 2005, he was in a serious car accident 
while on the job. Two people died in the accident and Applicant suffered significant 
injuries. He was unable to work from March 2005 until June 2006. During that time, he 
received workmen’s compensation in the amount of $1,000 per month. (Tr at 40-43; 
Gov 1, section 22)  
 
Applicant is involved in a custody battle with his ex-wife. She took the children 
and moved across the country without notifying Applicant or the court. He has not seen 
his children in two years. So far, he has spent approximately $2,400 in legal expenses 
pursuing custody of his children. (Tr at 20, 48; Gov 4 at 7) 
 
At hearing, Applicant claimed a lot of the debts alleged in the SOR belong to his 
ex-wife. He claims they were supposed to be equally responsible for the debts of the 
marriage. (Tr at 35) In a prior interview with an investigator conducting his background 
investigation on October 31, 2007, he said that he was responsible for 90% of the debt 
after the divorce. (Gov 2 at 6) He claims the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is solely his 
wife’s responsibility. (Tr at 37) He paid the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n. It is listed as paid 
in the March 3, 2009 credit report. (Tr at 34; Gov 5 at 2) SOR ¶ 1.n is found for 
Applicant.  All of the other debts remain outstanding. (Tr at 38.)  
 
Applicant recently was promoted. He earns $17.40 an hour. (AE A) His net 
monthly income is approximately $1,634.  Child support is deducted automatically from 
his paycheck each month.  He lives with his fiancé who works part-time and goes to 
school. He pays her $300 a month which covers rent and other related bills. In addition, 
he has the following monthly bills: $365 for car and insurance, $100 for cell phone; $300 
 
4 
 
 
for groceries; $50 for clothes; $75 for entertainment. He has no credit cards and no 
savings.  He estimates he has $75 left over after expenses each paycheck.  He hopes 
to begin making payments towards his delinquent accounts. (Tr at 27-34; AE D) He is 
current on federal and state income taxes. (Tr at 49) 
 
He works a part-time job as a bouncer. He estimates he earns approximately 
$400 per month in this job. (Tr at 53-54) He owes his sister $500 and his brother $500. 
(Tr at 55) He has never attended financial counseling. (Tr at 56)  
 
Applicant loves his job. It is the best job that he has ever had. (Tr at 19) His 
program manager states that he is a “dependable, loyal, and hardworking employee.” 
He states Applicant’s integrity, truthfulness, and work ethic are above reproach. (AE E 
at 1)  The CEO of another company states Applicant has worked for his company since 
June 2006, working in various departments, He states Applicant’s ethics, integrity and 
dedication to his job has made him the company’s “go-to” guy. (AE E at 2: Note: The 
record is unclear as to whether this company and the Applicant’s full-time employer are 
connected.)  
 
Applicant provided an unsigned copy of a performance report which rates him as 
a “5” which indicates his performance level is well above the expectations of the job. 
This performance report is given less weight because it is unsigned and the names of 
Applicant’s evaluators are not listed on the report. (AE E at 3-8) He has completed 
several training courses in conjunction with his job. (AE B) 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
5 
 
 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
 Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Since 2001, Applicant accumulated 23 
delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $16,625. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
 
6 
 
 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. All 
but one of Applicant’s delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Although employed full-
time since October 2006, he has not established a plan to resolve these accounts. 
Applicant continues to have financial problems. His failure to establish a plan to resolve 
his delinquent accounts raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and 
reliability.   
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant’s medical issues, 
his divorce in 2004, his custody issues, and his March 2005 automobile accident 
aggravated his financial problems. He was unable to work for more than a year after the 
accident. However, Applicant has been employed full-time since July 2006. He 
continued to incur delinquent accounts even though fully employed. In addition, he has 
no plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. This mitigating condition is given less weight 
because Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
FC MC ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. Applicant has not consulted a credit counselor. It is unlikely his 
financial problems will be resolved in the near future.  
 
FC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to SOR ¶ 1.n. It does not 
apply toward the remaining delinquent accounts.  A promise to pay in the future is not 
sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation 
is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
 
7 
 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s previous 
military service. I considered his periods of unemployment as a result of on-the-job 
injuries. I considered the additional expenses related to Applicant’s divorce and child 
custody issues. While all of these matters mitigate the reasons for Applicant’s financial 
situation, he has been employed full-time for over two and a half years. During this 
timeframe, he incurred additional delinquent accounts but established no plan towards 
resolving his delinquent accounts. A security risk remains because of Applicant’s history 
of financial irresponsibility and the lack of action taken towards resolving his delinquent 
accounts. He has not met his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under financial 
considerations.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
