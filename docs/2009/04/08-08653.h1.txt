HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant has 
demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment. She credibly promised to 
pay any valid, unpaid debts listed in her statement of reasons (SOR). Access to 
classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 31, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1). On January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant 
eligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and 
effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. 
 
 
2 
 
                                           
The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. 
 
On March 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 
14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 14, 2009. On April 14, 2009, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 21, 2009. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 22-24), and 
Applicant offered one exhibit (Tr. 76-77, 79-80; AE A). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 24), and AE A (Tr. 80). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, 
response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April 
29, 2009.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In her SOR response, Applicant admitted full responsibility for one debt listed in 
the SOR (SOR ¶ 1.c, $2,118), which she settled and paid (GE 9 at 1). She admitted she 
may owe a state tax debt, and filed documentation asking for recalculation of her tax 
liability (SOR 1.a, $932). She denied responsibility and/or knowledge of the other debts 
and noted they were not listed on her current credit report. She explained she was 
unable to research most of the SOR debts because SOR creditors could not locate her 
records without file or account numbers, which may be on her April 2008 credit report 
(the basis for the SOR). She requested a copy of the April 2008 credit report and 
promised to pay her legitimate debts, even though payment might be barred by the 
State statute of limitation for contracts (six years) (GE 9 at 4). Her admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is 42 years old (Tr. 6, 28). In 1985, she graduated from high school (Tr. 
6, 9). She received her associate’s degree in criminal justice and her bachelor’s degree 
in 2003 (Tr. 6, 28). She is currently working on her master’s degree in business 
administration (Tr. 7). She married in 1985 and divorced in 1986 (Tr. 9). She married 
the second time in 1987 and divorced in 1994 (Tr. 9). She married the third time in 1997 
and divorced in 2004 (Tr. 9). She married her current husband in December 2006 (Tr. 
7). Her stepdaughter is 18, and her biological children are 8, 10, 20 and 23 years old 
(Tr. 8). She attributed her SOR debts to financial problems resulting from her divorces 
and her efforts to support her children (GE 9 at 3-4).  
 
Applicant moved several times because her third spouse was on active duty. She 
lived in Germany from 2003 to 2006 and was employed as a contract specialist (Tr. 64-
 
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
 
65). Her current husband retired from a military service in June 2007, and has new 
employment (Tr. 67; GE 2 at 4). She is seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 10). 
 
In 2003, Applicant was unemployed for about five months (GE 1 at 47). 
Subsequently, Applicant has not been unemployed, except for seven months when she 
was in between jobs after moving from one state to another in 2007 (Tr. 66-67). She 
has worked for a government contractor since December 2007 as a budget and 
financial analyst (Tr. 26, 69). She received two certificates of appreciation from the U.S. 
Army for her work (Tr. 70). In 2008, she was selected as New Employee of the Year (Tr. 
70).  
  
Financial considerations 
 
Applicant completed her security clearance application on March 31, 2008, and 
noted that she obtained a list of eight delinquent accounts, totaling $6,565 from a credit 
report (GE 1 at 41-46). The delinquent accounts ranged from $2,500 to $50 (GE 1 at 
41-46).  She was unfamiliar with most of the creditors and debts. She subsequently paid 
or resolved all of the debts except for four debts, which were subsequently listed on her 
SOR in ¶¶ 1.f ($50), 1.g ($949), 1.h ($281), and 1.k ($1,035)(GE 8). 
    
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR), dated January 22, 2009, lists 11 
delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.k), totaling $20,299. When Applicant learned she had 
delinquent debts listed on her credit report in March 2008, she used available credit 
reports to contact creditors to resolve her debts (Tr. 35-37). She resolved five of eight 
accounts on her credit report. In early May 2008, an Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) investigator questioned Applicant about her knowledge of about 10 additional 
delinquent debts (AE A). Applicant denied knowledge of most of the accounts and 
promised to attempt to research and resolve them (AE A). On November 25, 2008, 
Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about her debts (GE 2). She provided 
proof of payment of some debts, and denied knowledge of other debts (GE 2).  
 
In regard to the SOR debts, Applicant was unable to locate sufficient account 
information to assist most of the SOR creditors in locating her accounts. Her search for 
creditors and account numbers was inhibited because she did not have the April 2008 
credit report (GE 4) that supported most of the allegations of delinquent SOR debt until 
about two weeks before her hearing (Applicant received the April 2008 credit report 
from previously assigned Department Counsel as part of the discovery process) (Tr. 37, 
40). Applicant was TDY for three weeks prior to her hearing (Tr. 50). She called or 
emailed creditors from her TDY location and asked the creditors to mail information to 
her home address (Tr. 36-37, 41, 50). The creditors sometimes commented that she 
should not worry about the debts because they were beyond the statute of limitations, 
as many were 10-13 years old, and had been dropped off of her credit reports (Tr. 75, 
77-78; GE 9). She did not know in several cases whether the SOR creditors had 
provided information to support the validity of the debts listed on the April 2008 credit 
report because she had not returned home to check her mail in three weeks (Tr. 36-37, 
41, 50). The resolution of her SOR debts is more specifically described as follows:  
 
 
4 
 
(1) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($932) is for a state tax lien (Tr. 38-39; GE 3 at 1; GE 
4 at 4). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 1). In her 
SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve 
the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). Applicant 
agreed she was responsible for this debt (GE 9). Applicant contacted the state and 
asked the state to recalculate her taxes because the tax filing did not correctly indicate 
her filing status as head of household (Tr. 38-39; GE 9 at 6-9, 12). She noted that the 
tax lien had expired (Tr. 38-39). She provided documentation supporting the dispute (Tr. 
38). She expected to learn whether she owed anything in a few weeks (Tr. 38-39). 
 
(2) Applicant denied knowing anything about the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($2,990) (Tr. 
39; GE 4 at 5). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 
1). In her SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her 
resolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). As 
soon as she received the April 2008 credit report listing the debt, she contacted the 
creditor and the creditor promised to provide detailed information about the debt (Tr. 
40). She thought that the debt might be beyond the statute of limitations if it was her 
debt; nevertheless, she promised to resolve the debt (Tr. 41). 
 
(3) On April 11, 2009, Applicant made the last payment to settle the debt in SOR  
¶ 1.c ($2,118)  for $1,350 (Tr. 41-43; GE 2 at 10; GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 1, 17). 
 
(4) Applicant did not know anything about the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($613) (Tr. 43; 
GE 4 at 6). This debt appears on the April 2008 credit report (GE 5). She was overseas 
from the time the account was opened to the time it was reported (Tr. 43). Applicant 
was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 1). In her SOR response, 
she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve the debt because 
this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). She has not yet contacted the 
creditor because she just received the April 2008 credit report (Tr. 44). 
 
(5) Applicant did not recognize the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($949), 1.f ($50), 
and 1.g ($949) (Tr. 45-48; GE 4 at 10, 11, 12). SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g appear to be a 
duplication of the same debt (Tr. 45-48). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt 
until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She called the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f, and the creditor was 
unable to locate information about the debt (GE 9 at 2). She noted this debt was not on 
her current credit report (GE 9 at 2). She left two messages for the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 
1.e and 1.f in the last two weeks; however, she has not received a response from the 
creditor (Tr. 45-46). If she can obtain sufficient supporting documentation, and the debts 
appear to be valid, she planned to submit the medical debts to TRICARE for payment 
(Tr. 47). 
  
(6) Applicant had an account with a telephone company listed in SOR ¶ 1.h 
($281) that apparently became delinquent after she moved overseas (Tr. 49; GE 4 at 
11). Applicant knew she had a debt on her credit report to a collection agency for $281 
(GE 1 at 44). Applicant was unaware of the source of delinquent debt (telephone 
company bill) until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She contacted the original creditor, and the 
 
 
5 
 
original creditor had no record of her account. She also contacted the collection agent; 
however, they could not locate the debt either without information from the April 2008 
credit report (GE 9 at 2). In her SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 
credit report to help her resolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit 
report (GE 9 at 1). Two weeks before her hearing, she received the April 2008 credit 
report (GE 5). After she received the April 2008 credit report (GE 5), she contacted the 
creditor to validate the debt (Tr. 49).  
 
(7) Applicant had an account with the credit card company listed in SOR ¶ 1.i 
($5,793) with a limit of $500 (Tr. 50-51; GE 4 at 11; GE 9 at 2). She thought her former 
husband may have had an account with the same company and generated the debt (Tr. 
51). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She 
contacted the creditor, and the creditor had no record of her account (GE 9 at 2). The 
creditor said they needed the April 2008 credit report to assist in locating the debt. In 
her SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her 
resolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 2).  She 
asked the credit card company for information about the debt; however, she did not 
receive a reply (Tr. 51-52).  
 
(8) Applicant did not recognize the creditor’s name in SOR ¶ 1.j ($4,589) (GE 9 at 
2). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). In her 
SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve 
the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 2). She did not 
get a chance to contact the creditor for the reasons explained previously (Tr. 36-37, 41, 
50, 52-53; GE 4 at 13). 
 
(9) Applicant agreed that she had a telecommunications account with the creditor 
listed in SOR ¶ 1.k ($1,035) (Tr. 53; GE 4 at 13; GE 9 at 3). After Applicant moved, her 
husband kept an account with the creditor (GE 9 at 2). Applicant was unaware of this 
delinquent debt until March 2008 (GE 1; GE 9 at 2). She called the creditor; however, 
the creditor was unable to locate the account and thought the April 2008 credit report 
might have a good account number (GE 9 at 3). In her SOR response, she asked for a 
copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve the debt because this debt was 
not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 3). At her hearing, Applicant said her husband 
had documentation proving this debt was paid (Tr. 54). 
 
Applicant thought she could pay the debts without the assistance of a credit 
counselor (Tr. 55-56). Applicant’s experience as a contract representative and budget 
analyst provided her with the skills to prepare a budget.  
 
Applicant’s credit report, dated February 24, 2009, shows eight debts in “pays as 
agreed” status: (1) a vehicle loan of about $23,000 with a monthly payment of $592 (GE 
9 at 23); (2) a vehicle loan of about $29,000 with a monthly payment of $537 (GE 9 at 
25); (3) a student loan of about $5,000 with monthly payments of $35 (GE 9 at 26); (4) a 
student loan of about $1,800 with monthly payments of about $20 (GE 9 at 26); (5) a 
credit card debt of about $370 with monthly payments of about $35 (GE 9 at 29), (6) a 
 
 
6 
 
revolving department store account of about $200 (GE 9 at 31), (7) a credit card debt of 
about $430 with a monthly payment of $30 (GE 9 at 32), and (8) a credit card debt with 
a balance of about $500 (GE 9 at 25).  
 
Applicant provided letters showing payment of six non-SOR creditors (listed as 
delinquent on credit reports), with accounts resolved on July 31, 2007, October 28, 29 
and 30, 2008, November 24, 2008, and February 16, 2009 (GE 2 at 2, 11, 12, 13-14, 
15; GE 9 at 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16). Applicant’s credit report, dated February 24, 2009, 
corroborates her other evidence about paying several paid debts after charge off or paid 
after repossession (GE 9 at 23, 31-32, 33). Applicant made handwritten notes on the 
February 16, 2009, credit report indicating “paid” to correspond with the receipts she 
provided for several accounts listed in the report as currently being in delinquent status 
(GE 9 at 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16). 
 
Applicant purchased a home in February 2009 (Tr. 56-57). She has two car 
loans, a motorcycle loan, and three credit cards and all six accounts are current (Tr. 59-
61). See credit report information, supra. She has not missed any payments on her 
vehicle loans (Tr. 62). She has sufficient funds to pay off the balance on her credit cards 
and the $8,000 balance on the motorcycle; however, she prefers to make payments to 
establish her credit (Tr. 72-73). She provides substantial financial support to her 
children (Tr. 62).  
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement showed her and her husband’s 
combined monthly gross income is about $9,000, their monthly net income is about 
$8,000, and their monthly balance remaining after paying her debts and expenses is 
about $3,000 (Tr. 81-86; AE A; GE 2 at 4).    
 
Applicant promised to resolve her debts to the creditors who provided information 
establishing the validity of her debts even though they are not legally collectable 
because of the statute of limitations (Tr. 104-105). 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
an Applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
 
 
7 
 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
8 
 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, “Applicant’s credit 
report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant had  
[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.”  Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in her response to DOHA interrogatories, her SOR 
response and at her hearing. About ten years ago, she fell behind on some of her credit 
cards and accounts. She failed to ensure her creditors were paid as agreed. The 
government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
 
9 
 
                                           
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b) or 
20(e) because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her 
delinquent debts. Her delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the 
Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives 
partial credit under AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) because her financial problems initially 
resulted because of her divorces, and partially because of unemployment. She receives 
substantial mitigating credit because her delinquent debts “occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Moreover, she established that 
she acted responsibly under the circumstances, when she paid or settled and paid six 
non-SOR delinquent SOR debts, and eight current debts were in “pays as agreed” 
status.2 AG ¶ 20(e) does not fully apply because she did not dispute all of her SOR 
debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does fully apply to the two debts that were duplications of each other 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g (a medical debt for $949)). 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and 
therefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are “clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” She understands the 
security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent 
debt. She has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because 
she showed good faith3 in the resolution of her SOR debts.    
 
Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts sooner to 
resolve her delinquent debts. Her actions to date are insufficient to fully apply any of the 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

mitigating conditions. However, security concerns are fully mitigated under the “Whole 
Person Concept,” infra at pages 10-11.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
  There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. About ten years ago, 
several of Applicant’s debts became delinquent. Years passed without resolution of her 
delinquent debts. The SOR lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.k), totaling 
$20,299. Because of a duplication, she actually had ten debts, totaling about $19,000. 
She failed to keep her accounts current and she failed to maintain contact with her 
creditors. She failed to obtain financial counselling. After her OPM interview and receipt 
of DOHA interrogatories, she did not aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution, 
and sufficiently document her remedial efforts. These factors show some financial 
irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt raises sufficient 
security concerns to merit further inquiry.   
The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of any security violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. Her 
divorces, support for her five children and two periods of unemployment caused her 
income to significantly decline and/or her expenses to increase. Some credit card 
accounts or telephone/utility debts became delinquent. She moved several times, and 
her creditors lost track of her. Ultimately, she paid or settled and paid all delinquent 
accounts that she was able to validate. Her current, valid debts, such as her credit 
cards, two vehicle loans, and her mortgage are in “current” status. Her February 24, 
2009, credit report shows eight “pays as agreed” determinations. She provided receipts 
showing the derogatory determinations on this credit report were resolved through 
 
 
11 
 
payment of her creditors. She is now diligently working to determine the validity of the 
remaining SOR debts. She and her husband have ample income to pay any SOR debts 
that are valid. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person 
analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is 42 years old. She has achieved some important educational goals, 
demonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She is working on her 
masters of business administration degree. She has worked for the government 
overseas as a contract administrator and more recently as a budget analyst. She 
understands how to budget and what she needs to do to establish her financial 
responsibility. Years ago, she made mistakes, and her or her former husband’s debts 
became delinquent. She compounded those mistakes by failing to act more 
aggressively to resolve her debts after her OPM interview. There is, however, simply no 
reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a “meaningful track record” of 
debt payments by actually paying six non-SOR delinquent debts and a substantial 
delinquent SOR debt. Most importantly, she is paying her mortgage, two car loans, a 
motorcycle loan, and three credit cards as agreed. She is diligently endeavoring to 
determine whether any remaining SOR debts are valid. She credibly promised to pay 
any valid, remaining SOR debts, even if they are not legally collectible because of the 
State six-year statute of limitations for judicial enforcement of contracts. These factors 
show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. She has demonstrated her loyalty, 
patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the Department of Defense as a 
defense contractor. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all 
the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
 
 
12 
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
she is eligible for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.k:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
