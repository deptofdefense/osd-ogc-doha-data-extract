APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On February 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant
of the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
Applicant’s brief reads like an alternative Judge’s decision.  To the extent that Applicant is asserting that the1
Judge should have written a decision similar to her brief, she has not demonstrated error.  It is well settled that a party’s
disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or a party’s ability to argue for a different interpretation of the
evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-22755 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007).

of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On August 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry
denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief makes no  assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.   The1
Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged
the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.  Applicant has not made an allegation
of harmful error.  The Board does not review cases de novo.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge
denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
