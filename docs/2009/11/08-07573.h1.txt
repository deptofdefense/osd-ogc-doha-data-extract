HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) listed six delinquent debts, totaling 
$17,760. She resolved one debt for $581. She has not made sufficient progress 
resolving the other five SOR debts. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 10, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86) 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 15, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On August 3, 2009, 
Department Counsel announced she was ready to proceed on her case. On August 10, 
2009, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On September 14 and 15, 2009, DOHA 
issued hearing notices (GE 6, 7). On October 14, 2009, Applicant’s hearing was held. At 
the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), 
and Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 20-21; AE A-D). There were no objections, and I 
admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 19), and AE A-D (Tr. 22). Additionally, I admitted the Notices of 
Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 6-9). On October 22, 2009, I received the 
transcript.    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted she owed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.c, and 1.e.2 She explained that the debts resulted from her divorce and not having 
sufficient income to address her debts. A mortgage lender advised her not to attempt to 
resolve her delinquent SOR debts because they would be removed from her credit 
report because they were stale. She did not recognize the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. She made 
payments towards the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e; however, when she changed jobs she asked 
the creditor to accept a lower payment and the creditor refused. She disputed her 
responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f because the creditor misrepresented the services 
that would be provided as part of the agreement. Her admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 39 years old, and a defense contractor that has employed her since 
July 2007 in the areas of payroll, accounting, and human resources (Tr. 8, 24, 25). She 
has full-time employment with the government contractor, and she has had a part-time 
job working as a bartender for two months (Tr. 27, 57, 71). She has a graduate 
equivalency diploma (GED) and about two years of college (Tr. 8). In college, she 
focused on nursing, computers, and administration (Tr. 26, 27). After submitting her SF-
86 in 2008, she received an interim Secret security clearance (Tr. 9, 25, 27).   
 
Applicant married in 1995 and divorced in 2001 (Tr. 25, 26, 28; GE 1). She has 
custody of her children who are ages 17 and 13 (Tr. 26). She has never served in the 
military (Tr. 27).

Financial considerations 
 
The SOR listed six delinquent debts, totaling $17,760 as follows: 1.a (credit card 
debt resulting in a judgment—$7,595); 1.b (credit card—$6,123); 1.c (credit card—
$1,722); 1.d (cell phone account—$566); 1.e (cell phone account—$1,173); and 1.f (cell 
phone account—$581). 
 
After Applicant was separated from her spouse, she used credit cards to re-
establish her household (Tr. 29). Her husband promised to help with the credit cards, 
and they considered reconciliation of their marriage (Tr. 29). However, they were unable 
to salvage their marriage (Tr. 29). After her divorce she was unable to make her 
monthly credit card payments (Tr. 29).  
  
A 2008 credit report shows the account relating to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a resulted 
from a credit card account opened in 2004 (Tr. 28, 32, GE 5 at 4). The account had a 
high credit amount of $3,602, and a balance of $6,235 (Tr. 32; GE 5 at 4). The creditor 
obtained a judgment for $7,595 in June 2005 (Tr. 35; GE 3 at 2). Applicant has not 
contacted the creditor for at least a year or two (Tr. 32). In June of 2008, she applied for 
a mortgage to purchase a home (Tr. 32). The lender advised her not to contact the 
creditors and not to offer to settle her debts because it was too late (Tr. 32). Her old 
debts would “fall off” of her credit report anyway because they were stale (Tr. 32).  
  
Applicant’s 2008 credit report showed she opened the credit card account in 
SOR ¶ 1.b in November 2001 (Tr. 37; GE 5 at 5). Her credit report has a balance of 
$5,831 (GE 5 at 5). 
  
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,722) resulted from a credit card delinquency 
(Tr. 38). The date of last activity on account was August 2002 (Tr. 38; GE 5 at 11). 
  
Applicant did not recognize the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($566) (Tr. 38). However, she 
previously told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that this debt 
was for a credit card she opened in 2000 (Tr. 39; GE 2 at 3). She believed the 
information in the OPM summary was erroneous because she did not believe she 
opened any credit cards with less than a $1,000 credit limit (Tr. 40). Even after receiving 
her 2008 credit report, she did not make any inquiries to determine her responsibility for 
this debt (Tr. 40). 
  
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($1,173) and 1.f ($581) related to cell phone accounts 
(Tr. 40-42). She had some contacts with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e after the debt 
became delinquent; however, the creditor was unwilling to accept a low enough 
payment (Tr. 41). For the account in SOR ¶ 1.f, the cell phone company told her that 
her cell phone would have coverage when she moved to a different state; however, her 
cell phone account charged very expensive roaming fees (Tr. 42, 43). She thought the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.f was possibly paid in 2005 (Tr. 43; GE 1). However, her 2008 SF-86, 
indicates, “I am currently making payments with them to satisfy this debt.”

About two years ago, Applicant bought a house with someone else (Tr. 33). She 
was living with the person who purchased the residence with her (Tr. 51). On January 
28, 2009, she moved out of the house (Tr. 36). She obtained a court order of protection 
against him (Tr. 51). In September 2009, she signed a quitclaim deed (Tr. 33). Her 
December 12, 2008, credit report shows a mortgage loan of $175,000, which was 
borrowed in November 2008 (GE 4). There is no evidence that this mortgage debt is 
delinquent.  
 
Applicant paid the three non-SOR judgments listed on her January 10, 2008, SF-
86 for $800, $500, $300 (Tr. 45-48; GE 1). She planned to pay the SOR debts (Tr. 34, 
35). However, as of the date of her hearing, she has not paid her SOR creditors 
anything during the last two years (Tr. 34). She did not provide any written payment 
plans, or other documentation showing her plan to resolve her SOR debts. She does 
not have any current credit cards (Tr. 38). 
 
Applicant’s annual salary from the contractor has increased from about $27,000 
in 2007 to about $34,000 now (Tr. 52). Her net monthly salary is about $2,160 (Tr. 56). 
She receives $1,050 monthly in child-support payments (Tr. 57). Her part-time 
employment as a bartender pays about $250 monthly (Tr. 57, 71). Applicant’s monthly 
expenses are about $3,060 (Tr. 62). Her remainder after expenses is about $400 (Tr. 
63). She has about $200 in the bank (Tr. 67). A roommate recently moved into her 
apartment, and she hopes the roommate will contribute $300 monthly towards their rent 
(Tr. 66-67).  
 
Applicant’s annual salary before 2007 was about $30,000 (Tr. 53). She has never 
been unemployed (Tr. 55). She received some financial counseling and has generated 
a budget (Tr. 70-71). 
  
Character evidence 
 
Applicant’s supervisor from 2002 to 2004, described her as a trustworthy and 
responsible person (AE A). Applicant had access to sensitive medical information, 
social security numbers, and payment information and never mishandled or abused that 
access to information (AE A).  
 
Applicant assisted a coworker during July 2004 to June 2007 with making travel 
arrangements, and as part of her duties, Applicant was entrusted with credit cards and 
sensitive financial information (AE B). Her coworker was confident that she is a 
trustworthy and responsible position. 
 
Applicant’s supervisor during July 2004 to June 2007 noted she was often trusted 
with sensitive personal and financial information (AE C). He described her as a 
trustworthy and responsible employee (AE C).     
 
Applicant’s supervisor at the defense contractor from June 2007 to the present 
indicates she has been promoted twice and is a tremendous asset to her employer (AE 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
D). She routinely handles sensitive personal and financial information (AE D). Applicant 
is a “very efficient, loyal and trustworthy employee.” (AE D). 
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted that an 
“Applicant’s credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case 
that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR 
Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is also documented in her OPM interview, her responses to DOHA interrogatories, her 
SOR response, and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors 
were paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is 
required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because she 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She has made insufficient progress 
paying or resolving her SOR debts, which now total about $17,000. None of the SOR 
debts are paid. Her delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because her financial problems 
initially resulted from underemployment and divorce.3 She does not receive full 
mitigating credit because she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative to 
resolve her delinquent debts. She has been divorced since 2001, and her largest debt, 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($7,595), resulted from a credit card account opened in 2004 that 
resulted in a judgment against her in June 2005. SOR debt 1.a cannot be attributed to 
her divorce. She did not provide documentation showing her requests to creditors to 
start payment plans. She has not contacted her SOR creditors for about two years.  
   
 
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
AG ¶ 20(c) does not fully apply. Although Applicant received some financial 
counseling and generated a budget, she did not show any reduction in her SOR debts, 
even though she learned about the security significance of her delinquent debts during 
her OPM interview on March 17, 2008. She has not sufficiently demonstrated the 
financial self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve her SOR debts. There are not 
“clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” She does not 
receive full mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because she did not establish good faith4 in the 
resolution of her SOR debts.   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because of the lack of documentation supporting 
Applicant’s dispute of any debts. However, under all the circumstances, I did mitigate 
her debt in SOR ¶ 1.f for a $581 cell phone account. She explained that the cell phone 
company promised that she would not have to pay roaming charges after she moved. 
Then after she moved the cell phone company improperly billed her for roaming 
charges at her new residence.       
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Although her debts initially resulted from 
underemployment and divorce, she has made little progress the last two years resolving 
her SOR debts. She did not pay any of her SOR debts. She did not make an initial 
payment on any payment plans on any of her SOR debts for the last two years.      
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
    
The whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
significant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant’s security 
clearance at this time. Applicant’s supervisors noted Applicant’s excellent work 
performance. She is a diligent, hard working, and dedicated employee. She was candid 
and forthright about her financial history. Her financial problems initially resulted 
because of underemployment and her divorce in 2001. The government is well aware of 
her financial problems, and her financial problems do not render her vulnerable to 
exploitation, manipulation, and duress. Applicant is a capable, reliable, and dedicated 
employee.   
 
The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial at 
this time.  I have resolved SOR debt 1.d for Applicant because of her credible account 
describing why she does not owe the cell phone company. She still has five unresolved 
SOR debts, totaling about $17,000. She does not have a debt consolidation plan and 
has not set up payment plans with the five SOR creditors. Her efforts to address her five 
remaining SOR delinquent debts for the last two years have been inadequate, and 
financial considerations concerns are not mitigated at this time.       
  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors,”5 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude she is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  
 
Applicant provided strong character references, and there is no evidence of prior 
criminal conduct, security violations, or any other non-financial security concerns. If 
Applicant resolves the five remaining delinquent SOR debts (for example, if she has 
well-established payment plans on each debt), and has no misconduct or other new, 
adverse information raising any disqualifying condition(s), her security clearance should 
be approved a year after the date of this decision.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
PARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
