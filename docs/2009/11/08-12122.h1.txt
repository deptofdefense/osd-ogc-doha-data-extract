FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on March 26, 2008. On May 
28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on 
December 29, 2005.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 9, 2009; answered it on June 22, 2009; and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on 
 
2 
 
 
June 24, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 24, 2009, and the 
case was assigned to me on July 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 
6, 2009, scheduling the hearing for September 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which 
were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until September 18, 2009, to 
enable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX D 
through F. Department Counsel’s response to AX D through F is attached to the record 
as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2009. The 
record closed on September 18, 2009. 
 
Amendment of SOR 
 
 On my own motion and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR 
to insert Applicant’s middle name, which was omitted from the SOR (Tr. 5). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the 
SOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of 
fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working in a 
shipyard (Tr. 34). He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He served 
on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1983 to November 2003, retiring as a staff 
sergeant (GX 2). He received a security clearance in December 1983, while on active 
duty. He received a clearance as a contractor in 2005 (Tr. 12). He has worked on three 
defense-related contracts since his retirement (Tr. 33).  
 
 Applicant was married in May 1987 and divorced in June 1992. He remarried in 
June 1997 and was divorced in August 2004. He has three daughters, ages 21, 20, and 
11.  
 
 In July 2001, Applicant and his then wife filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition. When they divorced in August 2004, Applicant’s ex-wife agreed to make no 
claims for a share of his military retired pay, and she agreed to make the payments to 
the bankruptcy trustee, because most of the debts included in the bankruptcy were 
hers. She failed to make the payments as agreed, resulting in the bankruptcy being 
dismissed in April 2006 (Tr. 44-45; GX 1 at 28; GX 7 at 4). The bankruptcy is alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.w. 
 
 In January 2002, Applicant was arrested for a bad check offense, pleaded nolo 
contendere, and was sentenced to probation for 30 days. In May 2002, he was arrested 
for a bad check offense, pleaded nolo contendere, and was sentenced to probation for 
12 months (GX 3). 
 
 
3 
 
 
 Applicant was given partial custody of his youngest daughter in 2007. He quit 
one of his two jobs to take care of his daughter, and he fell behind on his monthly 
installment payments (GX 5 at 1-3). 
 
 In February 2009, Applicant hired a “credit repair and restoration” expert. (GX 7 
at 7-8). He terminated the relationship when the expert stopped taking his calls (Tr. 49). 
 
 In March 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to 
DOHA interrogatories. He reported monthly net income of $2,749, expenses of $2,031, 
debt payments of $960, and a net monthly remainder of $718. He inadvertently listed 
his child support payments of $360 twice and neglected to include his car payments of 
$600. It appears that the actual net remainder should have been listed as $118 (GX 7 at 
5).  
 
 In August 2009, Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency (AX B). On 
September 9, 2009, one week after the hearing, he agreed to a payment schedule, 
managed by the credit counseling agency, for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.i, 1.k, 
and 1.m. The agency recomputed his monthly expenses to be $3,244, and it suggested 
ways he could reduce his monthly expenses from $3,244 to $2,867 (AX E). The 
agency’s computation of expenses would result in a monthly shortfall of about $118 
unless Applicant’s net income increased from the amount reported in his March 2009 
personal financial statement. 
  
 Applicant was unable to work for the three weeks preceding the hearing due to a 
work-related injury (AX C). His pay was reduced from $700 a week to $300 a week 
during this period of disability (Tr. 37). He expected to return to full pay in mid-
September and to work four hours of overtime every day on a ship undergoing overhaul 
(Tr. 50).

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
 
5 
 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG ¶ 19(a) is 
raised by an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” AG ¶ 19(c) is raised by “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” AG ¶ 19(e) is raised by “consistent 
spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, 
significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.” 
Applicant’s financial history raises all three disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden 
to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An 
 
6 
 
 
applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving 
it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).  
 
 The evidence indicates that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.u are 
duplicates. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). I will 
resolve SOR ¶ 1.u in Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established because Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, not yet 
resolved, and did not arise from circumstances unlikely to recur. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that ‘the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant has encountered circumstances 
beyond his control, i.e., periods of unemployment or underemployment and a divorce, 
but he has not acted responsibly. He took no significant actions to resolve his debts until 
July 2009, after he received the SOR. He did not finalize his payment plan until after the 
hearing. I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant 
has received counseling, but insufficient time has passed for him to establish a track 
record of responsible behavior. The evidence falls short of the “clear indications” 
required to establish this mitigating condition. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not 
mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   
 
 An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each 
and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 
2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all 
 
7 
 
 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. Id. 
 
 After a long history of financial neglect, Applicant finally initiated a plan to resolve 
his debts, but the catalyst for taking action was the SOR. Applicant was motivated 
primarily by the threat to his job, not a sense of duty or obligation. I conclude that the 
element of “good faith” is not established by the evidence. 
 
 Applicant cannot keep his job without a clearance, but the financial impact of 
losing his clearance is not relevant. See ISCR Case No. 02-09220 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 
2004). In his closing statement, he suggested the possibility of placing him on probation 
for six months or a year. The Appeal Board has made it clear that administrative judges 
do not have authority to grant conditional clearances. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 
WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar.1, 2000). See also ISCR Case No. 01-24328, 2003 WL 
21979745 at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003).  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature adult who served on active duty in the Army for 20 years. 
He has held a clearance for most of his adult life, but he has not been attentive to his 
personal obligations. The SOR appears to have convinced him to start working on his 
financial obligations. His track record, unfortunately, is one of inattention and neglect. 
He appears to have a workable plan, but he has not yet begun to execute it.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
 
8 
 
 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.k:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.m-1.n:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.o-1.q:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.r-1.t:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.u-1.v:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.w:     Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
