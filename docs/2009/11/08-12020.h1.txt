Decision 
__________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
In 1971, Applicant was born in Afghanistan. In 1987, Applicant’s father brought 
him to the United States, and in 2002, he became a U.S. citizen. His son, father, sister 
and brother are U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Afghanistan, and assisted U.S. 
combat forces as a translator and liaison for six months. An Army Lieutenant Colonel 
who worked with Applicant in Afghanistan lauded his duty performance, bravery, and 
contributions to mission accomplishment. Applicant wishes to return to Afghanistan as a 
translator. He has significantly greater contacts with the United States than with 
Afghanistan. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. 
interests.  
 
In January 2008, Applicant became unemployed due to the decline in his 
mortgage and real estate business. He was the victim of a massive fraud. He was 
unable to pay seven debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR); however, he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. He credibly promised to pay his delinquent debts 
when he receives adequate employment. Foreign influence and financial considerations 
security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Statement of the Case 
 
On January 29, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 8, 
2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and B (Foreign Influence) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The action was 
taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the 
President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for 
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On May 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge (HE 3). On June 16, 2009, Department Counsel was 
prepared to proceed. On June 19, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On July 8, 
2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On August 11, 2009, the hearing was held. 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 28), 
and Applicant offered eight documents (AE A-H)1 and one book (AE I) (Tr. 22-31). 
There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-I (Tr. 26-31). I received the 
transcript on August 19, 2009. On September 4, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded 
six additional exhibits she received from Applicant (AE J-O). There were no objections 
(HE 5), and I admitted AE J-O.   
 
Procedural Ruling 
 
Department Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning 
Afghanistan (Tr. 31; HE 4, AN Request). Department Counsel provided supporting 
documents to show detail and context for these facts (HE 4, Ex. I to VIII). Applicant did 
not object, and I granted Department Counsel’s request (Tr. 31). 
 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for 
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 
2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR 
proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. 
See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types 
of facts for administrative notice).  
 
1 At the hearing, Applicant’s exhibits were pre-marked AE A with Attachments 1-7 (Tr. 20-23).  
After the hearing I re-marked them as AE A-H.

Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant’s response to the SOR admitted the allegations in ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j, and 2.c 
to 2.g (HE 3). He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b (HE 3). His admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor who is seeking a 
security clearance (Tr. 6-7). He married in 2000, and his divorce was final in 2008 (Tr. 
32, 56). He has an eight-year-old son; however, he is not required to pay child support 
because he is underemployed (Tr. 33-34). The family court will establish his child 
support requirement after he is re-employed (Tr. 33-34). He has the equivalent of an 
associate’s degree in political science (Tr. 7, 33).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
From September 2002 to December 2007, Applicant was self-employed in the 
mortgage and banking industry (Tr. 21-22, 35-36; GE 1). Applicant went to Afghanistan 
for about six months in 2004 to 2005 (Tr. 22). After he returned from Afghanistan, he 
discovered an employee had defrauded his business in 2004 (Tr. 22-23).3 The 
employee created a “shell company” and forged Applicant’s signature on loan 
documents (AE C). The employee defrauded Applicant and banks or mortgage 
companies of hundreds of thousands of dollars (AE C). 
 
Applicant spent tens of thousands of dollars attempting to resolve the allegations 
of fraud (Tr. 22). The employee who committed the thefts and forgeries was indicted, 
and Applicant is listed as the victim of the forgery in one of the counts of the indictment 
(Tr. 22; AE C). An August 5, 2009, letter from a deputy district attorney (DDA) indicates 
Applicant is the victim of forgery and his cooperation and assistance resulted in the 
felony conviction of the perpetrator (AE C).4 During the course of mediation, the 
employee who defrauded Applicant accepted responsibility for one of the debts 
generated during the fraud (Tr. 80-81; AE L). The DDA suggested that Applicant use the 
fraud conviction to obtain judgments against the person who defrauded him for any 
debts generated by the fraud (Tr. 81).  
 
 
2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names 
of other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources 
contain more specific information. Applicant’s opening statement was admitted as an exhibit and as 
substantive evidence (Tr. 27). 
 
3The indictment indicates one theft of mortgage-related funds occurred September 23-30, 2004 
(AE C). 
 
4Department Counsel agreed with Applicant that Applicant was exonerated from a mortgage-
fraud allegation, and credited him with continuing to work with the district attorney’s office to bring the 
criminals to justice (Tr. 18). 
 
 
4 
                                                                                                                                             
Applicant’s mortgage and real estate business was barely breaking even in 2006 
and throughout 2007 (Tr. 35-36). He was unemployed starting in December 2007. He 
decided to seek employment as a translator and cultural advisor in January 2008 (GE 
1). After he learned his security clearance was not being approved in December 2008 or 
January 2009, he obtained employment earning $500 a month by taking care of elderly 
persons at their homes (Tr. 24, 34-35). He lives with a relative and pays monthly rent of 
$300 (Tr. 71).  
 
Applicant’s SOR debts 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed ten delinquent debts totaling $64,418 as follows: ¶ 1.a 
(judgment—$7,610); ¶ 1.b (tax lien—$3,230); ¶ 1.c (collection account—$474); ¶ 1.d 
(collection account—$269); ¶ 1.e (collection account—$166); ¶ 1.f (repossession—
$34,000); ¶ 1.g (2007 judgment for fraud—$17,500); ¶ 1.h (collection account—$171); ¶ 
1.i (collection account—$599); and ¶ 1.j (collection account—$399). His SOR response 
(HE 3) admitted all debts. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a (judgment—$7,610)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he was 
responsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). The judgment was filed in 
November 2006 (GE 2 at 28). At the hearing, he said he was unfamiliar with this debt 
(GE 3).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b (tax lien—$3,230)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant owed the state 
taxing authority $3,230 (Tr. 42; SOR ¶ 1.b). On March 30, 2008, he promised to pay the 
state $100 per month (AE F at 1, 4). He did not make any payments to the state 
because of underemployment and unemployment (Tr. 43-44).   
 
SOR ¶ 1.c (collection account—$474)—PAID. On March 11, 2008, he paid the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c $377 (Tr. 44-45; AE D at 10-12). The creditor responded that he 
still owed $11 to the creditor (Tr. 44-45; AE D at 10-12).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d (collection account—$269)—PAID. Applicant listed the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.d ($269) on his SF-86 at Section 28, Item 6 (GE 1; GE 2 at 24). On March 21, 2008, 
he paid the last $151 owed on this account, and the creditor indicated the account was 
paid (Tr. 45-46; AE D at 15; AE N).   
 
SOR ¶ 1.e (collection account—$166)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant was 
unable to pay the debt because of unemployment (Tr. 46). 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f (repossession—$34,000)—SETTLEMENT PROPOSED. Applicant 
borrowed $43,000 to purchase a Toyota in June 2005 (GE 2 at 14). The monthly 
payment was $943 (GE 2 at 14). He made his last payment in November 2007, and his 
vehicle was repossessed (GE 2 at 14). Applicant disputed the amount of the debt (GE 2 
at 27; GE 3 at 9). The creditor offered to settle the debt for $17,000; however, Applicant 
was unable to pay the debt due to unemployment (Tr. 48).  
 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                             
SOR ¶ 1.g (2007 judgment for fraud—$17,500)—DISPUTED. The employee 
who defrauded Applicant has taken responsibility for paying off one debt; however, he 
has not actually paid it (Tr. 48-49, 80-81; AE C; AE L). The debt he agreed to pay is not 
necessarily the debt is SOR ¶ 1.g.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h (collection account—$171)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he 
was responsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). A February 21, 2008, 
credit report listed this debt as “disputed under reinvestigation” (GE 3 at 5). At his 
hearing, Applicant said he was unfamiliar with this debt (Tr. 53-55; GE 3).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.i (collection account—$599)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he 
was responsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). A February 21, 2008, 
credit report shows the last act on account was in February 2008, and the account was 
transferred to the collection company from a bank (GE 3 at 8-9). At his hearing, 
Applicant said he was unfamiliar with this debt (Tr. 55; GE 3).  
 
SOR ¶ 1.j (collection account—$399)—PAID. On November 13, 2007, 
Applicant paid the $399 telecommunications debt (Tr. 55; AE D at 4; Section 28, Item 3, 
SF-86; SOR ¶ 1.j).  
 
Non-SOR debts. Applicant paid a debt of $427 on April 9, 2008 (AE D at 3; GE 
1, Section 28, Item 8, SF-86). On March 25, 2008, he paid a $910 debt (AE D at 5; GE 
1, Section 28, Item 10, SF-86; AE D at 5). On March 27, 2008, he paid a $637 debt (AE 
D at 6, 7). On March 24, 2008, Applicant satisfied a debt to the collection company he 
listed in his SF-86, Section 28, Item 1 as being owed $474 (GE 1; AE D at 14, 16). 
 
Federal income taxes. In 2002, Applicant’s adjusted gross income was $13,850 
(AE M). He had nothing withheld from his taxes, and the amount owed, if any, was not 
listed on his tax return (AE M). In 2003, Applicant’s adjusted gross income was $35,922 
(AE M). He had nothing withheld from his taxes, and owed $4,706 (AE M). In 2004, 
Applicant’s adjusted gross income was $41,749 (AE M). He had nothing withheld from 
his taxes, and owed $4,882 (AE M). In 2005, Applicant’s adjusted gross income was 
$77,954 (AE M). He had $1,150 withheld from his taxes, and owed $6,036 (AE M). In 
2006, Applicant’s adjusted gross income was $70,680 (AE M). He had $674 withheld 
from his taxes, and owed $5,384 (AE M). In 2007, Applicant listed no income on his tax 
return (AE M). For tax year 2008, he provided a Form 4868, Application for Automatic 
Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2008, with zero 
indicated in estimated tax liability and total 2008 payments to the IRS (AE M).  
 
On March 2, 2007, the IRS released an IRS tax lien for tax year 2002 amounting 
to $8,162 (AE F at 5). Applicant submitted the release of the 2002 IRS tax lien to 
demonstrate that he has paid off large obligations in the past (Tr. 44). 
 
Applicant owed the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2003, 2004, and 2005 
(AE F at 3-5). The IRS accepted his offer to pay $380 monthly starting June 1, 2008 (AE 
D at 3). Applicant did not provide documentation showing how much he owed the IRS 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                             
for tax years 2003 to 2005. Applicant did not indicate he made any payments under this 
agreement, and I presume he has not made any payments because of lack of income. 
 
Other financial information. Applicant had a credit card with a limit of $500, 
which was current as of March 11, 2008 (AE D at 9, 13). Applicant corresponded with 
the credit reporting companies to ensure their reports did not list the debts of his 
relatives (Tr. 23; AE E).  
 
Applicant promised to pay his debts (Tr. 72). He offered to have funds withheld 
from his salary or to have his clearance automatically revoked if he fails to pay his 
creditors as promised (Tr. 25). He offered to work for the U.S. government without a 
salary until his debts are paid (Tr. 73). He was confident that he could resolve all of his 
debts in one year, or perhaps much sooner, if he receives employment as a translator 
(Tr. 43, 72). He expected his annual salary, if hired as a translator in Afghanistan, to be 
about $210,000 (Tr. 72).  
 
In August 2009, Applicant received some financial counseling and generated a 
budget (Tr. 80; AE K). The budget only addressed his situation while receiving a 
monthly gross income of $500. He was well aware of financial issues through his 
experiences in the mortgage business (Tr. 79-80). 
 
On February 22, 2008, Equifax reported the creditor holding the account in SOR 
¶ 1.h was not reporting and some other accounts were listed as disputed (AE E at 7, 9). 
On March 21, 2008, Applicant disputed the presence of four debts on his credit report, 
including the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j (AE E). The February 21, 2008, credit 
report listed disputes and investigations in progress for SOR ¶¶ 1.d (GE 3 at 6), 1.e (GE 
3 at 8), 1.f (GE 3 at 9), and 1.h (GE 3 at 5).   
 
Foreign Influence 
 
In 1979, Applicant’s father was part of the resistance in Pakistan that opposed 
the Soviet Union’s occupation of Afghanistan (Tr. 20). The U.S. Government funded his 
efforts and due to his role in the resistance he became well known in Afghanistan (Tr. 
20). As a teenager, Applicant lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan (Tr. 20). Applicant 
assisted in the war to expel the Soviets by making trips into Afghanistan, and by 
interviewing Afghan and Soviet prisoners (Tr. 20). In 1987, Applicant’s cousin was 
kidnapped and others in the same profession as Applicant’s father were assassinated 
(Tr. 20). Applicant’s father sought asylum in the United States and Applicant moved to 
the United States with his father (Tr. 21; GE 1).  
 
Applicant lived in the United States from 1987 to 1993 (Tr. 21). He attended high 
school in the United States and participated in the U.S. political process (Tr. 21). 
Applicant’s family left the United States and Applicant’s father worked in an Afghan 
embassy as a consultant (Tr. 21). In 1996, Applicant returned to the United States and 
worked in the mortgage banking industry (Tr. 21).

In 2002, Applicant became a U.S. citizen (GE 1). His father returned to 
Afghanistan and was appointed to a high-level position in the Afghan national 
government (Tr. 22). In 2004, Applicant went to Afghanistan for his grandmother’s burial 
(Tr. 38). For the six months Applicant stayed in Afghanistan (2004-2005), he was a 
voluntary liaison between the Afghan Government and a U.S. Army base (Tr. 22, 39). 
He worked closely with the U.S. Marines and U.S. Army Special Forces (Tr. 22). He 
acted as a linguist and advisor to the U.S. Army concerning the Pashtun tribal system, 
local culture, and customs in one of the most dangerous provinces in Afghanistan (Tr. 
22, 67). In this role, he provided assistance to his father, who was an important Afghan 
Government Official (AGO), and to the U.S. Army (Tr. 39). Although there was always 
danger from explosives and mines, Applicant was not personally threatened or 
harassed by the Taliban (Tr. 67).  
 
A U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel (LTC T), who is a Special Operations Officer, 
lauded Applicant’s assistance to LTC T’s Provincial Reconstruction Team (AE C).  
Applicant helped with construction and development projects and on security issues (Tr. 
69). LTC T emphasized Applicant’s honesty, intelligence, focus, and compassion (AE 
C). LTC T noted that Applicant “brave[d] the violence [which was] necessary to gain the 
trust of local people who has been abandoned by everyone else. [Applicant] is a 
courageous and honorable young man who has a genuine passion for doing good. And, 
he is that rare man who has taken the action necessary, at great personal sacrifice, to 
actually get up and do that good for a great many people.  .  .  .” (AE C at 1-2).      
 
SOR foreign influence allegations. SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant’s spouse is a 
citizen of Afghanistan, who resides in the United States as a registered alien. He 
became divorced in 2008 (Tr. 32, 56). He does not stay in contact with his former 
spouse’s family living in Afghanistan (Tr. 57). 
 
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges Applicant’s sister is a citizen of Afghanistan, who resides in 
the United States as a registered alien. His sister was born in Afghanistan, became a 
U.S. citizen in 2008, and now lives in the United States (Tr. 57; GE 1).  
 
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that Applicant has extended family members who are citizens 
of Afghanistan and who reside in Afghanistan. Applicant has an uncle who is serving 
with the U.S. Army as a contract linguist in Afghanistan (Tr. 58). His uncle is a U.S. 
citizen (Tr. 58). Applicant’s brother is a U.S. citizen, who lives in Afghanistan (Tr. 59, 
74). His brother lives in the Afghan capital and works on research projects and as a 
security analyst for private firms (Tr. 70). His brother also works closely with an agency 
that is under U.S. State Department supervision (Tr. 70, 89-90). His brother has not 
been threatened and is not protected by a security detail (Tr. 70). Although Applicant is 
in regular contact with his brother, he has not talked to his uncle in about two years (Tr. 
59-60).  
 
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges that Applicant has friends who are citizens and residents of 
Afghanistan. Applicant has some acquaintances in Afghanistan from his visit in 2004; 
however, he does not maintain contact with them (Tr. 59). His relationship with the 
 
8 
                                                                                                                                             
                                           
acquaintances living in Afghanistan is not close, and he did not maintain any friendships 
with citizens and residents of Afghanistan over the last five years. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 2.e and 2.f allege that Applicant’s father is a close personal friend of an 
important AGO (Tr. 59). His father has known the AGO for at least 20 years (Tr. 60). 
When his father lived in Pakistan, his father had frequent contact with the AGO, and 
they were part of the resistance effort against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (Tr. 
60). From 1993 to 1996, Applicant’s father was an employee of Afghanistan in an 
embassy located outside of the United States and Afghanistan (Tr. 61). Applicant and 
the AGO have been good friends for many years and remain good friends (Tr. 61). After 
Applicant’s father returned to Afghanistan in 2002, the AGO appointed him to two 
important Afghan Government positions (Tr. 63-64). Applicant’s father was very pro-
United States, and because of that support he was targeted or threatened by terrorists 
or the Taliban (Tr. 68). 
 
In 2006, Applicant’s father resigned from his Afghan Government position and 
returned to the United States because he needed heart and eye surgeries (Tr. 64). The 
last time Applicant’s father went to Afghanistan was in 2008, and he stayed there for six 
to nine months (Tr. 65). His father went to Afghanistan to visit family and friends and not 
to work for the Afghan Government (Tr. 65). Applicant’s father introduced Applicant to 
many important Afghan Government officials when Applicant was in Afghanistan; 
however, Applicant did not maintain contact with them after he left Afghanistan (Tr. 66). 
Applicant’s father may return to Afghanistan if his health improves (Tr. 74). 
 
 In sum, Applicant’s mother, father, and one sister were born in Afghanistan, and 
all of them became U.S. citizens and live in the United States (GE 1). One of his sisters 
was born in Russia, became a U.S. citizen and now lives in the United States (GE 1). 
His brother was born in Pakistan, is a now U.S. citizen, and supports the United States’ 
goals though his work in Afghanistan. Applicant’s son was born in the United States and 
lives in the United States. 
  
Afghanistan5 
 
Afghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia. It is approximately the size of 
Texas (249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran 
borders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country 
which has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. In 2006, the population 
was about 31 million people with about 3,000,000 Afghans living outside Afghanistan.  
 
Afghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically elected 
president. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the 
Soviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union

withdrew from the country, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan and 
religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of 
the country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.  
 
In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the 
country, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic 
government took power in 2004 after a popular election. Despite that election, terrorists 
including al-Qaida and the Taliban continue to assert power and intimidation within the 
country. Safety and security are key issues because these terrorist organizations target 
United States and Afghan interests by suicide operations, bombings, assassinations, 
car-jacking, assaults, or hostage taking. At this time, the risk of terrorist activities 
remains extremely high. The country’s human rights record remains poor and violence 
is rampant. According to recent reports from the U.S. Department of State, insurgents 
continue to plan attacks and kidnappings of Americans and other Western nationals. 
Travel warnings are ongoing. No section of Afghanistan is safe or immune from 
violence.  
 
The United States supports the efforts of the Afghan Government to establish, 
 
a vibrant civil society, one that emphasizes democratic principles through 
a rule of law and creates accountable and transparent forms of 
government. The United States and its international partners remain 
committed to helping Afghans realize their vision for a country that is 
stable, democratic, and economically successful, and to an Afghan 
Government committed to the protection of women’s rights, human rights, 
and religious tolerance.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                             
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and B (foreign influence) 
with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR.

Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
  AG ¶ 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations.” The Appeal Board has noted, “Applicant’s 
credit report was sufficient to establish the Government’s prima facie case that 
Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.” ISCR Case 
No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is 
documented in his credit reports, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR 
response, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were 
paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                             
                                           
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because he 
did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His 
delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He has made insufficient progress paying 
or resolving his seven unpaid SOR debts, which now total about $65,000. However, his 
delinquent debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment for the reasons in the discussion of AG ¶ 20(b), infra.  
 
Applicant receives full mitigating credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because his financial 
problems resulted from the decline of his business, the fraudulent activity of an 
employee, and his unemployment and underemployment in 2008-2009.6 He was 
divorced in 2008; however, the record did not explain how his divorce exacerbated his 
financial problems. He has provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under 
the circumstances over the last two years.  
 
The Appeal Board’s discussion of AG ¶ 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an 
Applicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after 
circumstances outside an applicant’s control cause delinquent debt.7  In ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 
for $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 
(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). 
These three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included 
significant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the 
applicant’s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated 
about $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and 
three debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 
(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment 
plan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal 
Board at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, 
 
what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the 
circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial 
condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not “responsible” in 
light of his limited circumstances.    
 
 
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current.

The Applicant in this case has received financial counseling, generated a budget, 
and in 2007 and 2008 he paid the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.c ($474), 1.d ($269), and 1.j 
($399). On March 2, 2007, the IRS released an IRS tax lien for tax year 2002 amounting 
to $8,162. On March 25, 2008, he paid a $910 non-SOR debt. On March 27, 2008, he 
paid a $637 non-SOR debt. On April 9, 2008, Applicant paid a $427 non-SOR debt. 
  
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling. He provided 
a personal financial statement and started a debt consolidation and repayment plan. He 
worked in the real estate and mortgage business and demonstrated a firm grasp of 
budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. He has managed to live on $500 a 
month, demonstrating the financial self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve his 
debts. There are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control” because he still lacks the income to address his delinquent SOR debts. He also 
receives mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he established good faith8 in the 
resolution of his SOR debts. He acted with reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation, and he did not use bankruptcy or otherwise seek to 
avoid his responsibility to repay his creditors. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not fully apply. Although Applicant filed some disputes with 
credit reporting companies, he did not provide documentation showing his basis for the 
disputes. Moreover, in his SOR response he admitted all SOR debts. He has disputed 
some amounts of debts (for example, the amount owed on his repossessed vehicle), 
and those disputes are reflected in credit reports and in AE E.   
 
In sum, Applicant demonstrated sufficient diligence and effort to either resolve his 
delinquent debts or to stay current on their status while he seeks full employment. His 
debts initially resulted from underemployment, then unemployment in the aftermath of 
the fraudulent activity of one of his employees, and most recently underemployment as 
he has attempted to living on monthly income of $500. His SOR listed ten delinquent 
debts totaling $64,418. He paid three debts, and could settle his largest debt of $34,000 
for $17,000. He paid other non-SOR debts. I am confident he will keep his promise to 
pay his delinquent debts once he receives employment as a translator because of his 
 
8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

Foreign Influence 
 
  AG ¶ 6 explains the security concern about “foreign contacts and interests” 
stating: 
 
if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or 
she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, 
organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is 
vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication 
under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign 
country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, 
including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign 
country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected 
information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. 
 
AG ¶ 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional 
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a 
foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign 
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and 
 
(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that 
create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to 
protect sensitive information or technology and the individual’s desire to 
help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. 
 
Applicant and his wife are divorced. AG ¶ 7(d) (“sharing living quarters with a 
person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a 
heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion”) does not 
apply because there is no evidence he is living with someone who has foreign contacts.  
 
AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) apply. Applicant, his father, brother, and sister were born in 
Afghanistan. His brother and his uncle are working in Afghanistan. His brother and 
uncle have connections to the United States, which makes them probable targets of 
terrorists and the Taliban, along with thousands of U.S. and coalition armed forces and 
civilian contractors serving in Afghanistan. His father has a close friend, who is an 
important AGO. His father held important Afghan Government positions from 2002 to 
2006. He visited his Afghanistan in 2004-2005 for about six months, and he 
communicates frequently with his brother. 
 
Although Applicant’s communications with family members living in Afghanistan 
are not particularly frequent, his spouse may have more frequent, non-casual 
 
15 
                                                                                                                                             
communications with family members living in Afghanistan. “[T]here is a rebuttable 
presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family 
members of the person’s spouse.” ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at 
*8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted this presumption. Applicant’s 
relationship with his brother living in Afghanistan is sufficient to create “a heightened risk 
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.” Applicant’s 
relationship with his brother creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant’s 
“obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help” any 
family members who are in Afghanistan. For example, if Applicant’s father should return 
to Afghanistan, Applicant would also be exposed to a risk of coercion through his father.   
 
The mere possession of close family ties with a family member living in 
Afghanistan, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an 
applicant has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this 
factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially 
result in the compromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-
02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  
 
The nature of a nation’s government, its relationship with the United States, and 
its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant’s family 
members are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, 
persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian 
government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or 
the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United 
States. The relationship of Afghanistan with the United States, places a significant, but 
not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his 
relationships with his family members living in Afghanistan do not pose a security risk. 
Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose 
between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a family member living in 
Afghanistan.  
 
Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. “The United 
States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information 
from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, 
regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to 
those of the United States.” ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). 
Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States 
over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, 
we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, 
especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 
2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  
 
While there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Afghanistan seek or 
have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, 
nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. International 
terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable 
state intelligence services, and Afghanistan has an enormous problem with terrorism. 
 
16 
                                                                                                                                             
Applicant’s relationship with family members living in Afghanistan creates a potential 
conflict of interest because this relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security 
concern about his desire to assist family members in Afghanistan by providing sensitive 
or classified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of 
Applicant’s contacts with his brother and father and has raised the issue of potential 
foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further 
inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  
 
AG ¶ 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in 
which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those 
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be 
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign 
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the 
U.S.; 
 
(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of 
loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country 
is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding 
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected 
to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  
 
(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and 
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign 
influence or exploitation; 
 
(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or 
are approved by the cognizant security authority; 
 
(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency 
requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from 
persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and 
 
(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property 
interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not 
be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. 
    
AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant visited Afghanistan in 
2004-2005. Applicant has frequent contact with his brother, who lives in Afghanistan. He 
also has frequent contacts with his father, who may return to Afghanistan. His father has 
a high profile in Afghanistan because of his past important Afghan Government 
positions and relationship to an important AGO. Because of his connections to 
Afghanistan, Applicant is not able to fully meet his burden of showing there is “little 
likelihood that [his relationships with his relatives who are Afghanistan citizens] could 
create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.”

AG ¶ 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG ¶ 8(b) analysis is Applicant’s “deep 
and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.” Applicant has established that 
“[he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” In 
1987, Applicant’s father emigrated from Pakistan/Afghanistan to the United States to 
seek asylum because of threats to the family’s safety. Applicant attended high school in 
the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 2002. His son was born in the United 
States. Most importantly, Applicant has assisted U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan, 
which is a combat zone.  He has shown his patriotism, loyalty and fidelity to the United 
States.   
 
Applicant has strong family connections to the United States. His mother, father, 
and two sisters are all U.S. citizens and live in the United States. His brother was born 
in Pakistan, is a now U.S. citizen, and supports the United States’ goals though his work 
in Afghanistan. Applicant’s son was born in the United States and lives in the United 
States. 
 
Applicant’s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the 
potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his father and brother. He 
frequently communicates with these two family members, and his brother is currently 
living in Afghanistan. His father was an important Afghan official until 2006, and remains 
a friend of an important AGO. There is no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, 
the Afghanistan Government, or those conducting espionage have approached or 
threatened Applicant or his family in Afghanistan to coerce Applicant or his family for 
classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that Applicant 
or Applicant’s family would be specifically selected as targets for improper coercion or 
exploitation. While the government does not have any burden to prove the presence of 
such evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have a heavy 
evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.  It is 
important to be mindful of the United States’ huge investment of manpower and money 
in Afghanistan, and Applicant, his father and brother have supported U.S. goals and 
objectives in Afghanistan. His father and brother are potential targets of terrorists and 
the Taliban for their own activities and support for the United States, and Applicant’s 
potential access to classified information is unlikely to add significantly to the risk they 
face from lawless elements in Afghanistan.  
 
AG ¶¶ 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged 
Applicant’s involvement with family members living in Afghanistan. Applicant is not 
required to report his contacts with family members living in Afghanistan. 
 
AG ¶ 8(f) partially applies because there is no evidence that Applicant has any 
interest in property or bank accounts in Afghanistan. However, this mitigating condition 
can only fully mitigate AG ¶ 7(e), which provides, “a substantial business, financial, or 
property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated 
business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or 
exploitation.”  
 
 
18 
                                                                                                                                             
                                           
In sum, Applicant’s connections to family living in Afghanistan are less significant 
than his strong connections to the United States. His connections to the United States 
taken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns 
under Guideline B.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Foreign influence 
 
There are some facts supporting a foreign influence security concern because of 
Applicant’s connections to Afghanistan. Applicant, his brother, sister, and father were 
born in Afghanistan. His brother currently works in Afghanistan, and his father may 
return to Afghanistan. He traveled to Afghanistan in 2004-2005, and frequently 
communicates with his father and brother.  His father has a relationship to an important 
AGO and may be appointed to another Afghan Government position in the future.  
  
A Guideline B decision concerning Afghanistan must take into consideration the 
geopolitical situation in Afghanistan, as well as the dangers existing in Afghanistan.9 
Afghanistan is a very dangerous place because of violence from the Taliban and 
terrorists. The Taliban and terrorists continue to threaten the government of 
Afghanistan, the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who 
cooperate and assist the United States. Applicant recognizes his work with the U.S. 
Armed Forces will endanger his family living in Afghanistan, and will be personally 
dangerous. The United States and Afghanistan are allies in the war on terrorism, and 
 
9 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient 
discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). 
  
 
19 
                                                                                                                                             
the United States is committed to the establishment of a free and independent 
government in Afghanistan. Afghanistan and the United States have close relationships 
in diplomacy and trade.      
 
The circumstances tending to support approval of a clearance for Applicant are 
more significant than the factors weighing towards denial of his clearance. In 1987, 
Applicant’s father brought Applicant to the United States. In 2002, Applicant became a 
U.S. citizen. His son was born in the United States. He has significantly greater contacts 
or connections with the United States than with Afghanistan. Although he has frequent 
contact with his brother living in Afghanistan, his brother is a U.S. citizen and supports 
U.S. goals in Afghanistan. He does not own property in Afghanistan. When he was 
naturalized as a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States.  
 
Applicant returned to Afghanistan and served with U.S. Armed Forces as a 
linguist/translator/cultural advisor for about six months from 2004 to 2005. He voluntarily 
risked his life as part of his duties on behalf of the U.S. Army and Afghanistan. Reliable 
military personnel serving with him in Afghanistan laud his duty performance and 
contributions to mission accomplishment. He has put himself in harm’s way, working 
alongside U.S. Armed Forces. He has made contributions to national security, fully 
aware of the risks to himself and his family. All these circumstances demonstrate that 
Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist 
group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 
(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). Applicant’s strong connections to the United States and 
especially to his U.S. family, community and his employment as a translator in a combat 
zone establish “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] 
can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” See 
Discussion of AG ¶ 8(b), supra at pages 16-17. 
 
Financial considerations 
 
There are some facts supporting a financial considerations security concern. 
Applicant has seven currently delinquent debts totaling about $65,000. He also owes an 
undetermined amount of money to the IRS, and there may be additional unresolved 
debts created from his employee’s fraudulent activities.  
 
The facts supporting mitigation of the financial considerations security concern 
are sufficient under the whole person concept to warrant approval of his access to 
classified information. Applicant went to Afghanistan for about six months in 2004-2005. 
While he was in Afghanistan, an employee at his banking and real estate business 
forged documents and committed theft. When Applicant returned from Afghanistan his 
real estate business was beginning a downturn. The combination of a real estate 
downturn and legal problems from the forgery and theft caused Applicant financial 
problems. Applicant had a good track record of paying his debts prior to the decline in 
his business and the legal problems with an employee in 2005. In December 2007, he 
closed his business and planned to work in Afghanistan as a translator/cultural advisor. 
He was unemployed throughout 2008, and was divorced in 2008. When his security 
clearance was not approved, he obtained employment for $500 a month as an 
 
20 
                                                                                                                                             
                                           
untrained medical aide. A recession has increased unemployment in his state, and I 
infer the allegations of fraud surrounding Applicant’s business have made it more 
difficult for him to obtain employment in the banking and real estate sectors. 
 
Applicant has received financial counseling and generated a budget. He has 
worked in the real estate and mortgage businesses and demonstrated a firm grasp of 
budgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. In 2007 and 2008 he paid the SOR 
debts in ¶¶ 1.c ($474), 1.d ($269), and 1.j ($399). On March 2, 2007, the IRS released 
an IRS tax lien for tax year 2002, amounting to $8,162. In March and April 2008, he paid 
non-SOR debts of $910, $637, and $427. He was unable to make any additional 
progress from April 2008 to the hearing on August 11, 2009, because he lacked the 
income to pay his debts.  Even though he lacked the income to make any payments, he 
made payment arrangements with the IRS to pay $380 per month, with the state tax 
authority to pay $100 per month, and to pay other creditors under various payment 
plans. He could not pay child support; however, he promised to inform the court when 
he became adequately employed so that he could begin payments. He has done 
everything that he could reasonably and responsibly do to address his financial 
problems. He has managed to live on very little income (I presume he received 
unemployment compensation), and later on he subsisted on only $500 a month for 
almost two years. He credibly promised to pay his delinquent debts when he receives 
adequate employment. He offered to have his security clearance automatically revoked 
if he is unable to pay all of his delinquent SOR debts within one year of obtaining 
employment as a translator/cultural advisor.10 
 
After weighing all the facts and circumstances in this decision, including 
Applicant’s demeanor and sincerity at his hearing, I specifically find his statements to be 
credible, and I conclude he has carried his burden of mitigating the financial 
considerations and foreign influence security concerns. 
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”11 and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities 
under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access 
to classified information. 
 
 
10 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through 
credit reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar 
the government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security 
context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and 
establishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of 
documentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is 
conditional.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline B:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.g:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
