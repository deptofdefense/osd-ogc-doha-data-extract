HARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. His 
statement of reasons (SOR) listed ten delinquent debts totaling $13,451. He paid two 
SOR debts for $179 and $274. He is making monthly $70 payments on one SOR debt 
and plans to start a $25 monthly payment on a $148 debt in April 2009. He has not 
made adequate efforts to address his delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 8, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Sensitive Positions (SF 86) with a signed (e-QIP), dated January 3, 2007 (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 2). On December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant 
eligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of 
Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, 
as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by 
 
 
2 
                                           
the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense 
for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On February 2, 2009, DOHA received Applicant’s SOR response and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed 
on February 19, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009. On 
February 25, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 17, 
2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript 
(Tr.) 16-19), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. There were no objections, and I 
admitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 19). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and 
the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on March 23, 2009.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in 
the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is 38 years old (Tr. 6, 21; GE 1). In 1989, he graduated from high 
school (Tr. 6). He has not attended college (Tr. 6). He served in the U.S. Marines from 
August 1989 to August 1993 (Tr. 22; GE 1). He served overseas in Operation Desert 
Shield/Desert Storm (Tr. 22). He earned the National Defense Service Medal, the 
Southwest Asia Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (GE 4 at 22). 
His foreign service is three months and 21 days (GE 4 at 22). He received an Honorable 
Discharge from the U.S. Marines (Tr. 22).  
 
A government contractor and its predecessor on the same contract, have 
employed Applicant since January 2006 (Tr. 23). He has not been unemployed in the 
last five years (Tr. 49). Applicant is a field security technician, and his duties are to 
install security equipment, such as card readers and motion detectors (Tr. 7).  He does 
not have any felony or alcohol or drug-related arrests (GE 1). He has held a Top Secret 
security clearance since 1992 (Tr. 6).  
 
Applicant married in 1990 and divorced in 1998 (GE 1). He married again in 2006 
(Tr. 33). His six-year-old son and stepdaughter are living in his home (Tr. 33, 52).  His 
spouse works in a daycare center and so he does not need to pay for childcare (Tr. 52).

information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists ten delinquent debts, totaling $13,451. He has never filed 
for bankruptcy or had a property lien for taxes or debt (GE 1). He admitted responsibility 
for the ten debts (Tr. 24). His SF 86 disclosed he had a judgment for $2,700 (GE 1). He 
also had a 1994 Nissan repossessed (GE 1, GE 3). He disclosed on his SF 86 that he 
had debts currently over 90 days delinquent and debts over 180 days delinquent in the 
last seven years (GE 1). He listed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($274); ¶ 1.h ($6,811); a non-
SOR judgment in October 2006 for $2,843 toward which he had paid $2,744; and a 
non-SOR judgment in March 2006 for $2,700 (GE 1). He commented that he may have 
other delinquent debts (GE 1). He has not had any liens or garnishments filed against 
him (Tr. 38, 40). He did not have any problems paying his rent (Tr. 38-39). 
 
Two of his SOR debts resulted from personal loans, and most of the others were 
from credit cards (Tr. 44-46).  One was from a cell phone account and another was from 
an automobile insurance company (Tr. 46).   
  
Applicant was unemployed for one month in 2002 and then underemployed in his 
next job (Tr. 30, 49). He fell behind on his debts (Tr. 30). He has not been unemployed 
during the last five years (Tr. 49). Applicant had judgments entered against him in 2006 
and May 2007 (Tr. 34-37). He paid off the 2006 judgment for $2,843 (Tr. 37).  
 
Applicant said he was unable to afford payments to address his delinquent SOR 
debts using a debt consolidation program because it would cost about $500 monthly 
(GE 4). He was unable to borrow money to pay his debts (Tr. 43; GE 4). He paid his 
delinquent child support debt, his telephone bill and a small judgment (GE 4). 
 
Applicant has taken positive action to resolve four SOR debts (¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and 
1.j). The creditor in SOR debt ¶ 1.c ($148) agreed to accept $25 monthly beginning April 
3, 2009 (Tr. 25). Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($274) (Ex. 4 at 3, 8, 9). On 
October 15, 2008, he settled and paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($179) (Tr. 27; GE 4 at 18). 
The 2007 judgment was for $1,200, and he began paying $70 monthly on this judgment 
in May 2008 (Tr. 34-35; GE 4 at 3; SOR ¶ 1.j). He does not have any arrangements to 
pay any of the other SOR debts (Tr. 26-30). 
 
Applicant contacted the creditor in SOR debt 1.g ($85) and learned the debt was 
transferred to a collection agency (Tr. 28). The collection agency contacted Applicant 
and sent him a letter asking for payment (Tr. 29). Applicant has not responded to the 
collection agency’s letter (Tr. 29). 
  
Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) dated April 4, 2001, 
showing a gross salary of $3,278 (GE 3). His monthly expenses totaled $725, and 
monthly debt payments of $905 for five debts totaled $32,700 (GE 3). His net remainder 
was $1,648 (GE 3). 
  
Applicant’s PFS, dated in September 2008, is still accurate (Tr. 51; GE 4 at 6). 
His 2008 PFS shows a gross salary of $4,966 for himself and $1,600 for his spouse (GE 
 
 
4 
6). Their combined net salary is $3,630 (GE 4 at 6). Their monthly expenses total 
$3,365, and include a monthly debt payment of $70 for one debt, which he listed as 
totaling $1,200 (GE 4 at 6; SOR ¶ 1.j). His net remainder is $195 (GE 4 at 6). He lists a 
car expense of $1,400, and his next highest expense is $1,215 for rent, and his third 
highest expense is $727 for child support (Tr. 32; GE 4). Applicant and his spouse are 
making payments on two vehicles (Tr. 41, 52-53). He has about $8,000 in a 401K 
account (Tr. 40). He has not borrowed against his 401K account (Tr. 41).  Applicant and 
his spouse do not currently have any credit cards (Tr. 47).  Applicant promised to make 
a more aggressive effort to pay his debts (Tr. 58). 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
 
 
5 
Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an Applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An Applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG ¶ 18 articulates the 
security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR 
response and at his hearing. As indicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j, he had ten delinquent 
debts totaling about $13,451. His financial difficulties began in 2002 and continue today. 
The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
 
6 
                                           
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his ten delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because his financial problems “occurred under such 
circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur;” however, there is some residual doubt 
about whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent SOR debts and is 
making adequate steps to do so. He realizes the importance of avoiding delinquent debt 
and promise to make a greater effort to keep his debts current. AG ¶ 20(e) does not 
apply because he did not dispute any of the SOR debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged due to 
reduction of income while he was unemployed and subsequently by underemployment, 
and divorce. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. About two years ago, he 
obtained his current employment and thereafter he paid several of his debts. He 
established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to the debts 
he paid.2  
 
 
2“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his 
debts current. 
 
 
7 
                                           
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received some financial counseling or 
advice in connection with discussions with debt consolidation companies. He paid some 
of his non-SOR delinquent debts and one judgment. Applicant has taken positive action 
to resolve four SOR debts (¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and 1.j). Applicant telephoned the creditor in 
SOR debt ¶ 1.c ($148), and the creditor agreed to accept $25 monthly beginning April 3, 
2009. Applicant paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($274) and 1.f ($179). The 2007 judgment 
was for $1,200, and he began paying $70 monthly on this judgment in May 2008 (Tr. 
34-35; GE 4 at 3; SOR ¶ 1.j).  He did not have any arrangements to pay any of the other 
SOR debts (Tr. 26-30). These are some positive “indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control.” He understands the security implications of delinquent 
debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because Applicant showed some good faith3 in the 
resolution of his SOR debts.    
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His payment of two small delinquent SOR debts 
for $179 and $274, his plan to start a $25 monthly payment on a debt for $148, and his 
$70 monthly payments to another SOR creditor are simply inadequate to fully mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
8 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
  Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to serve 
in the U.S. Marines, and serving in Southwest Asia during Operation Desert 
Shield/Storm. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the 
Department of Defense, his employer and that he is an honorable person. There were 
no allegations of security violations. He does not have any felony arrests or any drug or 
alcohol-related arrests or convictions. Applicant is a security agent. He is a high school 
graduate, but did not attend college. He is not sophisticated in the area of finance. He 
made mistakes, and debts became delinquent. Expenses from his divorce and from 
paying child support, as well as unemployment and underemployment contributed to his 
financial woes. He received some financial counseling and has learned about how to 
avoid future delinquent debts. He paid several non-SOR debts including his child 
support debt, and is current on his car loans. He is well on his way to establishing a 
meaningful track record of debt repayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. May 21, 2008). He is motivated to have a successful career as an employee of a 
Department of Defense Contractor, to pay his delinquent debts and to have his security 
clearance reinstated. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. 
 
The whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. He began to have 
financial difficulties in 2002, when several debts became delinquent. In October 2008, 
he received DOHA interrogatories and in December 2008, he received the SOR. He 
had ample opportunity to contact more of his SOR creditors and to make greater 
progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He paid one delinquent SOR debt for $179 
in October 2008, and another SOR debt for $274 prior to October 2008. He began 
making monthly $70 payments in May 2008 to address the judgment related to the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,168). He plans to begin making $25 payments on his $148 debt in SOR 
¶ 1.c. He made insufficient progress over the last six months to resolve his delinquent 
debts, even though he had steady employment and ample opportunity to contact his 
creditors and provide documentation. For example, in the first three months of calendar 
year 2009, he described monthly payments of only $70 made to address his SOR 
debts. He was on clear notice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more 
so after he received the SOR that he needed to show substantial progress in the 
resolution of his delinquent debts; however, he made insufficient effort to accomplish 
this security responsibility.      
 
 
9 
After Applicant’s delinquent SOR debts are paid or satisfied, and after a 
reasonable period of time without additional delinquent debts, (assuming no other 
disqualifying conditions surface), Applicant’s clearance should be reinstated. He needs 
some time after his SOR debts are paid to reestablish his financial responsibility.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the 
financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set 
forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of 
the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent 
factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities 
under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government’s 
case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified 
information at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.b: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs  1.c and 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.i:  Against Applicant   
Subparagraph 1.j:   For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
