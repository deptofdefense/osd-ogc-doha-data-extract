KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: Applicant had 8 debts totaling approximately $247,000.  The Judge found that of those
debts, none have been proven to be paid except the last.  Thus, the Judge could reasonably
conclude that Applicant’s financial problems were still ongoing.  The Judge discussed the role 
Applicant’s wife’s illness played in his financial difficulties. The presence of some mitigating
evidence does not alone compel a favorable security clearance decision. The Judge has to weigh
the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable
evidence, or vice versa.  Adverse decision affirmed.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On December 31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe
denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse clearance
decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.
In this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant had accumulated 8 debts totaling approximately
$247,000.  Decision at 2.  The Judge found that: “Of those eight debts, none have been proven to be
paid except the last listed debt in Paragraph 1.h.”  Id.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could
reasonably conclude that Applicant’s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  
The Judge explicitly discussed Applicant’s wife’s illness and the role that played in his recent
financial difficulties. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to
make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the
evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,
or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant’s
disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different
interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or
reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).
The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the recency and
seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant
conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to
overcome the government’s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After
reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated
a satisfactory explanation for his decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the facts found
and the choice made.’” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,
168 (1962)).  Therefore, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under
Guideline F is sustainable.
