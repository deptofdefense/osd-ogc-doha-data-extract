Decision 
______________ 
 
 
HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-
QIP), on October 16, 2006. On July 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
On August 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. The 
case was delayed because Applicant was working in Iraq and did not return to the 
United States until late January 2009. On February 6, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was 
issued, scheduling the hearing for March 4, 2009. The case was heard on that date. 
The Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits 
(Gov) 1 – 4. Applicant testified and offered seven exhibits which were admitted as 
 
2 
 
 
Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - G. His wife served as his personal representative. The 
record was held open until March 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional 
documents. An additional 17-page document was timely submitted and admitted as AE 
H. The transcript was received on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case 
file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e.  
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old logistics management specialist employed with a 
Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his 
company since September 2004. His highest level of education is a high school 
diploma. Applicant enlisted in the United States Army in September 1988. He injured his 
back and separated from active duty in 1991. He was on the temporary disability retired 
list. In 1994, he was declared fit for duty and returned to active duty. He served until 
1997. He separated on March 10, 1997 as a specialist (E-4) with an Honorable 
discharge. He is married and has no children. His wife has two adult children. (Tr at 6-
11, 38-39, 61-63; Gov 1; AE H at 9, 11)  
 
On October 16, 2006, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for 
investigations processing (e-QIP), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1) A 
subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had several delinquent 
accounts, an approximate total balance of $66,454.  The delinquent accounts include:  a 
$5,914 credit card account charged off in July 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 5 at 2; 
Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 3); a $7,000 credit card that was charged off in July 2003 (SOR ¶ 
1.b: Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 8); a $1,434 credit card account that was charged off in July 
2002 (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 6); a $3,970 account placed for collection in 
January 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $6,249 credit card placed for 
collection in January 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 9, 10); a 
$15,818 credit card account that was placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.f: 
Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 3, 10);  a $15,045 balance owed after a voluntary car 
repossession that was charged off in March 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.g: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; 
Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 3; AE B at 2; AE C at 3); and an $11,024 credit card account that 
was placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 7 at 6). 
 
On May 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting his 
background investigation. He indicated that he purchased a home in 1998 but was not 
prepared for the additional financial burdens that came with owning a home. He did not 
have money to furnish the house and pay his monthly bills. He and his wife charged 
many bills and household expenses to their credit card accounts. The credit card bills 
piled up until he was unable to pay the credit card bills and meet his household 
expenses.  Applicant wants to pay his debts but has no income at the end of the month 
 
3 
 
 
to pay his expenses. When his financial situation improves he intends to pay these bills. 
(Gov 3 at 3.) 
 
In response to interrogatories, dated March 10, 2008, Applicant indicated that he 
was deployed to Iraq and his financial situation was improving rapidly.  He indicated that 
he was saving all that he can in order to pay back all of his debt. He hoped to pay off all 
of his debt in 2009 when he returns from Iraq.  He indicated that some of the debts 
should drop off his credit report due to the age of the debt but indicated that he was 
aware that it was his obligation to pay the debts back. He would not compromise his 
character or perform his job unethically because of his debts.  He has served in the 
military or worked for a defense contractor since 1988. He would hate to think that he 
could lose all that he has accomplished. That is why he wants to do the right thing and 
pay off his debts. (Gov 2 at 4-5) 
 
At hearing, Applicant indicated that some of the accounts are double or triple the 
original balances due to late fees. He referred to the debts as “junk debt.” He testified 
that his initial financial problems began in November 2003. His wife lost her job in 2001 
because of health issues and has not worked since. They had three roommates who 
paid rent which helped with the mortgage payments. They all left at once. He states that 
the fact that these are old debts should mitigate some of the concerns raised. Some of 
his delinquent accounts will be deleted from his credit report in less than a year. He 
believes that settling these old debts may not be in his best interest because they may 
reappear as entries on his credit report which could adversely affect his credit rating. He 
is aware that the government needs to trust him but doesn’t want to be put in a position 
where he has bad debts listed on his credit report for additional years.  He has no 
motivation to do anything stupid or violate the law. (Tr at 26-29) 
  
Applicant provided proof that he has resolved two accounts. They were not 
alleged in the SOR but were considered during his background investigation. (Tr at 23-
24; AE D; AE E) The status of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR are: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d and 1.h: $5,914 charged off credit card account. This account 
was settled on April 8, 2008, for $1,506. Applicant states that the SOR allegations are 
the same debt.  The record evidence indicates that SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d are the same 
debt. (Tr at 43-44, 50-51; AE A; AE F) There is substantial record evidence to conclude 
that SOR ¶ 1.h is also the same account. I come to this conclusion because the same 
account number is listed on the credit report entries for the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 
1.h. (Tr at 50- 53; Gov 7 at 3, 6; AE G)  SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d and 1.h are found for Applicant.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b: $7,000 credit card account. Applicant claims this account is the same 
as the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.  The record evidence supports this premise. It appears 
the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f purchased the debt from the original creditor who is 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 1.b because it is a 
duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr at 48-50, 56-57; Gov 7 at 3, 8, 10) 
 
 
4 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c: $1,484 credit card account. No payments have been made on this 
account. (Tr at 55-56) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e: $6,249 credit card account placed for collection. The debt remains 
unresolved. (Tr at 56) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f: $15,818 collection account.  This is the same account as SOR ¶ 1.b. 
This creditor is the collection agency collecting on the original debt. The balance 
increased substantially due to late fees and penalties. This debt has not been resolved. 
(Tr at 50, 56-57) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g: $15,045 amount owed after a voluntary car repossession.  In 2002, 
Applicant purchased a car with no money down and no payments for 12 months. At the 
end of the 12-month period, he was unable to make the car payments and initiated a 
voluntary car repossession. He has not contacted the creditor to make payment 
arrangements. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr at 57-58; Gov 3 at 3)  
 
Applicant worked two tours in Iraq as a contractor. His first tour was from January 
2005 to late December 2005. His second tour was from January 11, 2008, to late 
January 2009. Applicant’s salary in Iraq was double his stateside salary. (Tr at 60-61) 
He used the extra income to put as much as he could into his 401(k) account; he made 
extra mortgage payments; and made payments towards the bills that were in good 
standing. (Tr at 65) 
 
Stateside, Applicant earns approximately $60,000 annually. His gross monthly 
income is $5,000. His net monthly income is $2,400. He also receives a VA disability 
check each month for $263. Applicant took out two loans against his 401(k) account. 
The monthly payments are automatically deducted from his pay. This explains why his 
paycheck is significantly lower than his gross monthly income. In 2004, he took a loan of 
$17,000. This will be paid in 2010. He took out a second loan against his 401(k) in late 
2006. He borrowed $22,000 in order to purchase a new car. He bought a new car for 
$32,000 in 2007. The value of his 401(k) is currently $69,000. The balance used to be 
$160,000 before the problems with the stock market began. (Tr at 32-35, 43)  
 
Applicant’s monthly expenses include mortgage $1,200; car loan $171; car 
insurance $150; gas $120; electric $332; cell phone $99; cable $100; Internet $45; 
water $35; groceries $250; clothes $25. Applicant has one open credit card with a 
$1,200 balance. He makes a $100 monthly payment. In 2004, Applicant purchased a 
time share for $15,000. He pays $300 per month for the time share. His total monthly 
expenses are $2,877. His net monthly income is currently $2,663. He has approximately 
$13,000 in his savings account. (Tr at 31-42)   
 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
 
In 2002, Applicant enrolled with a credit counseling company. He used their 
services for awhile but stopped because he was unable to afford the $700 monthly 
payments. From 2002-2003, he enrolled with another credit counseling company but 
stopped for similar reasons. (Tr at 46-47) 
 
Applicant received numerous awards, certificates of achievement, and letters of 
appreciation throughout his civilian and military careers. (AE H)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole person concept.” The Administrative Judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
 
6 
 
 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Since 2002, Applicant accumulated a 
significant amount of delinquent debt. At the close of the record, approximately $38,546 
in delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Late fees and penalties for lack of payment 
have contributed to the total balance of the debt. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 
(FC MC) ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. While 
several of the accounts were duplicates, Applicant continues to have significant 
unresolved debt. Applicant has paid several of his delinquent accounts. However, his 
plan for most of the delinquent accounts is to wait for them to drop off his credit report 
rather than attempting to resolve the accounts. He does not deny that they are his debts 
but believes that any attempts to resolve the older accounts would adversely affect his 
credit rating. During the same time that he incurred delinquent accounts, he purchased 
a timeshare, contributed the maximum amount to his 401(k) account, and purchased a 
new car for no money down and no payments for 12 months. After 12 months, Applicant 
turned the car in because he was unable to make payments. With some better judgment 
and planning, Applicant could have managed his finances and established a plan to 
 
7 
 
 
resolve his delinquent accounts. Questions about Applicant’s judgment, trustworthiness, 
and reliability remain based on Applicant’s failure to honor his financial obligations.   
 
 FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant’s wife lost her 
job in 2001 and had surgery. She has not worked since that time even though she is 
capable of working. Applicant states that his financial obligations were aggravated when 
three individuals who were renting rooms from he and his wife unexpectedly moved out. 
This may have some impact but Applicant could have sought out additional boarders to 
help out with the mortgage payment.  Applicant was paid double his salary in 2005 and 
2008 while working in Iraq. Instead of developing a plan to resolve his delinquent 
accounts, Applicant allotted more money to his 401(k) account, made additional 
mortgage payments, and additional payments towards his current accounts. He did not 
act responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
FC MC ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control) does not apply. While Applicant consulted credit counselors in the past, he has 
not done so recently. Although he resolved several of his delinquent accounts, several 
delinquent accounts remain with no plan in place to resolve the accounts.   
 
FC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.a. However, the remaining debts remain unresolved. Applicant implied at hearing that 
he intends to wait until the older accounts are removed from his credit report rather than 
attempt to settle the accounts.  When he worked in Iraq, he had significant extra money 
to apply towards his delinquent accounts. He chose to apply the extra income towards 
other things as opposed to resolving his delinquent accounts. He has not demonstrated 
a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  
 
FC MC ¶ 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d and 1.h; and SOR ¶¶ 
1.b and 1.f. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.a. 1.d, and 1.h because the 
record evidence established that they are duplicate accounts and Applicant submitted 
proof that the debt was resolved. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 1.b because 
it is a duplicate account with SOR ¶ 1.f. I do not find for Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 
1.f because it is not resolved.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness 
of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.” Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility 
for a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon 
careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s active duty 
military service and his years of employment with a Department of Defense contractors. 
I considered Applicant’s explanations for his delinquent debt. I considered that Applicant 
has resolved several accounts and several accounts were duplicates. However, a 
significant amount of delinquent accounts remain with no established plan to settle 
these accounts. It is unlikely the delinquent accounts will be resolved in the near future 
because Applicant’s current monthly expenses are more than his monthly income. He 
has not met his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
