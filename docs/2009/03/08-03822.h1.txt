FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant refuted the allegations under 
Guideline E, but she did not mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on February 23, 2007. On 
September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her 
application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005.

 Applicant answered the SOR on October 11, 2008, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
November 24, 2008, and the case was assigned an administrative judge on the same 
day. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing 
for 9:00 a.m. on January 14, 2009. Applicant arrived for the hearing at about 11:20 a.m., 
because she mistakenly thought the hearing was scheduled for the following day until 
she was contacted about her failure to appear at 9:00 a.m. The administrative judge 
continued the case until a date to be determined.1  
 
The case was reassigned to me on January 21, 2009. DOHA issued an amended 
notice of hearing on January 23, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 2, 2009. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were 
admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted without objection. 
I granted Applicant’s request to keep the record open until February 20, 2009, to enable 
her to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX H through P, 
which were admitted without objection (Hearing Exhibit I). DOHA received transcript 
(Tr.) on February 13, 2009. The record closed on February 20, 2009. 
 
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings 
 
Hearing Notice 
 
 Applicant was given the required 15-day notice for the hearing originally 
scheduled for January 14, 2009; however, the amended notice of hearing was issued 
less than 15 days before the hearing on February 2, 2009. The parties agreed that the 
February 2 hearing was a continuation of the January 14 hearing, and Applicant agreed 
continue the proceedings on February 2, 2009 (Tr. 20-21). 
 
Uncharged Misconduct 
 
 Applicant objected to evidence that she failed to disclose an unsatisfied judgment 
when she executed an application for sensitive positions (SF 85P) in 1994, asserting 
that it was irrelevant and unfair (Tr. 83, 89). Department counsel had informed Applicant 
of his intention to offer the SF 85P and a credit report reflecting an unpaid judgment (GX 
13).  
 
Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s 
credibility; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to 
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or in the 
whole person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I 
overruled Applicant’s objection and admitted the SF 85P and credit report for the limited 
purposes of considering whether Applicant had a pattern of delinquent debts as early as

1994 and whether she had a pattern of concealing debts on her security clearance 
applications (Tr. 84-85, 88). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR with 
explanations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old data base administrator employed by a defense 
contractor. She has worked for her current employer since September 2004. Two 
colleagues describe her as dependable, dedicated, security conscious, and loyal (AX 
G). One of her colleagues has worked with her at their church for two years and noted 
her commitment and devotion to her family (AX G at 1). 
 
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1988 to February 
1996. While in the Army, she worked as an information systems analyst (Tr. 10). She 
received a top secret clearance in February 1988, but she does not currently hold a 
clearance (Tr. 9-10).  
 
 Applicant was married in August 1990 and divorced in July 1992. She remarried 
her former spouse in February 2004. She has four children, ages 20, 16, 14, and 7. 
 
 Applicant has an associate’s degree in information technology, a bachelor’s 
degree in organizational management, and is currently working on her master’s degree. 
She testified she is about 12 credits and one year away from obtaining her master’s 
degree (Tr. 9). 
 
 On April 6, 2001, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy solely in her 
name, listing liabilities of about $116,309 and assets of $82,950. The debts listed in her 
bankruptcy petition included numerous delinquent credit card accounts, a deficiency 
from a car repossession, and student loans. Her assets included a house and lot worth 
$55,000 and a time share in a vacation resort worth $13,000. Her case was dismissed 
on February 8, 2002 for failure to make payments (GX 4).  
 
When Applicant filed her bankruptcy petition, she was the mother of three 
children and pregnant with twins. Her doctor prescribed bed rest in late June 2001. She 
did not return to work until after the babies were delivered in December 2001. One of 
the twins died shortly after birth. Her income stopped in June 2001 and she was unable 
to make the payments required by the bankruptcy court. She had not worked for her 
employer long enough to have any benefits (Tr. 36-37).  
 
 In 2002, Applicant moved to another location and was unemployed until March 
2003, when she found part-time employment at a bank (Tr. 37). She and her former 
spouse reconciled. Her former spouse had serious financial problems, with outstanding 
 
4 
 
 
student loans, a deficiency from a car repossession, and delinquent credit cards. They 
remarried in February 2004. 
 
March 26, 2004, Applicant and her spouse filed a petition for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, listing liabilities of about $102,656 and assets of $68,213. Applicant testified 
that most of the delinquent debts were her husband’s, but his bankruptcy lawyer 
advised that they file a joint bankruptcy so that it would not appear that her husband 
was hiding assets (Tr. 38-39). The case was dismissed on July 22, 2004, for failure to 
commence payments (Tr. 37-39; GX 5). 
 
 On August 6, 2004, Applicant and her spouse filed a petition for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, listing liabilities of about $116,283 and assets of $68,053. The case was 
dismissed on January 5, 2005 for failure to appear at the creditor’s meeting and failure 
to make payments (GX 6). 
 
 On March 31, 2005, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy solely in 
her name, listing liabilities of about $101,812 and assets of $61,250. On September 15, 
2005, the case was dismissed for failure to make payments (GX 7). Applicant testified 
she did not make the payments because she was unable to work for a substantial 
period of time as a result of a highly contagious infection (Tr. 41). Her testimony was 
corroborated by medical records reflecting treatment from July 2005 to July 2006 (AX 
C). 
 
 On October 14, 2005, Applicant again filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
solely in her name, listing liabilities of about $109,712 and assets of $66,050. The case 
was dismissed with prejudice on February 21, 2006, for failure to commence payments. 
She was prohibited from refilling within 180 days (GX 8). Applicant testified she was still 
suffering from the infection and unable to work. The tenants in her rental property 
refused to pay rent once they learned about her bankruptcy, and the house was in 
danger of being foreclosed.  
 
 On April 27, 2006, Applicant again filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
solely in her name, in an effort to prevent foreclosure on her rental property (Tr. 43). 
Unlike her previous petitions, where she was represented by a bankruptcy attorney, she 
filed this petition pro se. On May 18, 2006, the case was dismissed based on the prior 
dismissal with prejudice (GX 9). 
 
 In August 2006, Applicant’s elderly mother moved in with them. In November 
2006, her brother suffered a stroke and also moved in with them (Tr. 41-43, 57). In 
September 2007, Applicant completed a monthly cash flow worksheet tracking her 
expenses for four weeks. There is a notation at the bottom of the worksheet, “Not 
enough income!!” Loan consolidation and Chapter 7 bankruptcy are handwritten on the 
worksheet as options (AX N). 
 
 On January 4, 2008, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy solely in 
her name, listing liabilities of about $138,607 and assets of $19,476. By this time, the 
 
5 
 
 
rental home had been foreclosed and a car repossessed (Tr. 44). Her debts were 
discharged on April 21, 2008 (GX 10). Before filing the petition, Applicant was 
contributing about $335 per month to her 401k retirement account (Tr. 48). The debts 
discharged included a judgment on a delinquent car loan for $13,000 and a $1,000 
personal loan, a $6,000 debt for furniture, a number of overdrawn checks, payday 
loans, and start-up costs and operating expenses for a telemarketing business 
Applicant operated from her home (Tr. 51-55). She and her spouse also incurred about 
$15,000 in landscaping expenses for the house they were renting, because they hoped 
to buy the house. Their low credit scores prevented them from being able to buy the 
house (Tr. 54).  
 
 Applicant currently has two credit cards with small balances, which she pays off 
every month. Her spouse has none (Tr. 45-46). She has a 12-year-old car that is paid 
for, and her spouse has a five-year-old car on which he is making payments (Tr. 47). 
After the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant and her spouse have kept their accounts 
separate, except for the rent and utilities, which they share (Tr. 47).  
 
In addition to the mandatory counseling required by the bankruptcy court, 
Applicant has received financial counseling from her credit union (Tr. 50). She 
completed a three-day debt management course in April 2007 (AX P). She is keeping a 
budget that was designed by her credit union that reflects a net monthly remainder of 
about $378 for spending and savings (Tr. 50; AX L at 3). Among other items, the budget 
includes two $20,000 student loans, on one of which she has budgeted payments of 
$50 per month. The other student loan is in a deferred status (AX P at 3).  
 
Applicant and her spouse have moved into a smaller house, reducing their 
monthly rent from $1,750 to $1,350 (Tr. 65; AX L at 1). The now have only one cell 
phone, and they have reduced their cable service (Tr. 65). Applicant’s credit union 
statement for the month of January 2009 reflects a balance of $15.14 in one share 
account, a balance of $2,505.11 in a second share account, a zero balance in her 
“quick cash loan” account, and an end-of-month balance of $721.28 in her checking 
account (AX O). As of August 2008, she was earning $24.36 per hour. She had earned 
$49,880 in the previous year (AX D). Her credit reports for January 2009 reflect that she 
is current on all obligations (AX E and F). 
 
 When Applicant submitted her SF 86 in February 2007, she answered “yes” to 
question 27a, asking if she had filed for bankruptcy during the past seven years. The 
computer printout of the data entries on her SF 86 reflects the bankruptcy petition filed 
in March 2004 (GX 5), but it does not reflect her other bankruptcy petitions (GX 1 at 9). 
She answered “no” to questions 23a through 23f, asking about her police record. The 
computer printout of her SF 86 does not reflect her arrest in February 2001 for driving 
under a suspended license and resisting arrest, nor does it reflect that she was charged 
with passing a fraudulent check in March 2003 (GX 1 at 8; AX B). Applicant testified that 
when she asked her security office why some of the information was not listed in the 
electronic printout of her SF 86, one of the security specialists told her the disk was 
corrupted (Tr. 74). 
 
6 
 
 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant insisted she disclosed all her bankruptcies when she 
submitted her SF 86 (Tr. 66). After the hearing, she produced an EPSQ SF 86 
worksheet on which she answered “yes” to the bankruptcy question and listed the filing 
date as “2001/04/06.” This entry could indicate bankruptcies filed in 2001, 2004, and 
2006; however, it appears to reflect the precise date of her first Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition, which was filed on April 6, 2001.  
 
Applicant also listed the details of the two bankruptcy filings in 2004 under the 
general remarks section of her worksheet (AX M at 27-28). She did not list her petitions 
filed in 2005 or 2006. The 2004 filings were at the very bottom of the last page of the 
worksheet, suggesting the possibility of a continuation sheet, but no continuation sheet 
was included in her post-hearing submission. In the general remarks section (AX M at 
28), she commented, “I have experienced some financial struggles in the past but have 
obtained better employment.” Her Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed after she submitted 
her SF 86. 
 
Applicant listed the bad check offense on her worksheet under the question 
about other offenses not covered elsewhere (AX M at 24). The conviction of driving with 
a suspended license and the charge of resisting arrest are also listed on the worksheet 
(AX M at 23). She testified that when she gave the worksheet to her security officer, he 
told her not to list the conviction of resisting arrest because it was a traffic offense 
related to charge of driving under a suspended license (Tr. 68-71). 
 
 In November 2008, Department Counsel sent Applicant a blank SF 86 and 
informed her he intended to present it at the hearing (GX 14). At the hearing, she 
submitted a SF 86 bearing her signature and dated December 13, 2008 (AX A). She 
testified it was “the one from 2006,” but it appears to have been filled out after she 
received the blank SF 86 from Department Counsel (Tr. 30). On this SF 86, she 
answered “yes” to the question whether she had ever been charged with or convicted of 
a felony, even though all the offenses on her criminal record are misdemeanors (AX A 
at 7; AX B). She also answered “yes” to the questions regarding bankruptcies, 
garnishments, repossessions and debts more than 180 days delinquent (AX A at 8-9). 
She also testified that AX A did not include the “back sheet” listing all her bankruptcies. 
 
 In rebuttal, Department Counsel presented a SF 85P certified by Applicant on 
January 29, 1994 and recertified on February 15, 1994, on which she answered “no” to 
the question, “In the last 5 years, have you, or a company over which you exercised 
some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or 
had legal judgment rendered against you for a debt?” She also answered “no” to a 
question asking if she was over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation 
(GX 11 at 9). Department counsel presented a credit report dated April 6, 1994, 
reflecting an unpaid judgment for a telephone bill for $795 that was entered against 
Applicant in June 1990 (GX 12 at 2).  
 
 
7 
 
 
Applicant testified she did not know a judgment had been entered against her 
when she completed the 1994 application (Tr. 80). She stated she did not know why 
she did not disclose the delinquent telephone bill on her 1994 application (Tr. 80-81). 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
8 
 
 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   
 
 Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges between April 2001 and April 2006, Applicant filed four Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petitions that were dismissed for non-payment (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 
1.e), one petition that was dismissed for non-payment and failure to appear at the 
creditor’s meeting (SOR ¶ 1.c), and one petition that was dismissed because it was filed 
within 180 days of an earlier dismissal (SOR ¶ 1.f). It also alleges she filed a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy in January 2008 and received a discharge in April 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.g).  
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶ 19(a) is raised where there is an 
Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG ¶ 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is 
raised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and 
the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a 
realistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG ¶ 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not 
meeting financial obligations.@ AG ¶ 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending 
beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ 
 
Applicant’s financial history establishes all these disqualifying conditions, shifting 
the burden to her to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. 
Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and 
 
9 
 
 
the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG ¶ 20(a). This is a compound 
mitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. If any of 
the three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully 
established unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Applicant’s debts were recent, numerous, 
and did not occur “under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” 
Furthermore, her financial history casts doubt on her good judgment. Thus, I conclude 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.@ AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant has encountered 
several conditions beyond her control. She was divorced in 1992. When she reconciled 
with her husband and they were remarried, her husband brought considerable debt to 
the marriage. She was incapacitated from June to December 2001 while awaiting the 
birth of twins. She suffered from a highly contagious infection from July 2005 to July 
2006. She became responsible for an elderly mother and disabled brother in late 2006. 
Her telemarketing business failed in 2007. However, she did not act responsibly. She 
spent beyond her means, incurred irresponsible expenses such as an expensive 
landscaping for a home that they did not own, obtained expensive payday loans, and 
failed to attend the creditor’s meeting required by the bankruptcy court on one occasion. 
I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant 
completed a debt management course, received financial counseling through her credit 
union, adopted a reasonable budget, and is current on her obligations. Her financial 
situation is precarious, but it is under control. I conclude AG ¶ 20(c) is established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.@ AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Bankruptcy is a legitimate means of 
resolving excessive indebtedness, but it does in itself not establish a good faith effort. It 
is appropriate to consider the actions that led to the delinquent debts and Applicant’s 
 
10 
 
 
failure to address them before resorting to bankruptcy. ISCR Case No. 01-26675 at 3 
(App. Bd. Jun.13, 2003). Applicant presented no evidence of actions to resolve her 
debts before resorting to bankruptcy. I conclude AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. 
 
 Even though the mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(c) applies, I conclude the 
security concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated because this one 
mitigating factor is outweighed by Applicant’s extensive track record of delinquent debts 
and bankruptcy filings. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 The SOR alleges Applicant falsified her SF 86 by disclosing only one of her 
bankruptcy filings (SOR ¶ 2.a), and by not disclosing a misdemeanor arrest and 
conviction in February 2001 and a misdemeanor bad check charge in March 2003 (SOR 
¶ 2.b). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15 as follows:  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   
The relevant disqualifying condition in this case is set out in AG ¶ 16(a) as follows: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  
 
 When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government 
has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant’s 
state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the 
record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial 
evidence concerning an applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR 
Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  
 
 The government’s evidence is a computer printout of the data extracted from 
Applicant’s SF 86. Applicant’s certification is attached to the computer printout, not the 
original questionnaire. Whether Applicant carefully reviewed her application before it 
was submitted is unclear. She appears, however, to have difficulty with the printed 
word, as evidenced by her misreading of the original hearing notice in this case and her 
admission of a felony arrest on the blank SF 86 sent to her by Department Counsel. To 
corroborate her testimony that she disclosed all her bankruptcies, she produced her 
 
11 
 
 
handwritten EPSQ SF 86 worksheet that listed three bankruptcies instead of the single 
bankruptcy reflected on the computer printout of the data entries on her SF 86. The 
worksheet appears genuine and there is no evidence suggesting it was fabricated. 
Applicant repeatedly testified about a “back page” of her application listing all her 
bankruptcy petitions. I am satisfied that she disclosed her multiple bankruptcies as best 
she could, but somewhere in the process some of the information was lost. 
 
 Applicant’s EPSQ SF 86 worksheet also disclosed her two misdemeanor arrests 
in February 2001 and March 2003. She received bad advice from her security officer 
when he told her the February 2001 charge of resisting arrest was a traffic offense that 
was not covered by the questionnaire. She characterized one of her offenses as more 
serious than it was, listing it as a felony. 
 
 Applicant’s testimony on the falsification issue was candid, plausible, and 
credible. She appeared baffled by the accusation that she falsified her application, and 
her worksheet corroborates her insistence that the computer printout omitted 
information from her SF 86. I am satisfied she did not intentionally falsify her SF 86, and 
I conclude AG ¶ 16(a) is refuted by the evidence.2 No other disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline are raised. 
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in 
AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
                                                          
2  Even if I had concluded that AG ¶ 16(a) was not refuted, I would have resolved the personal conduct 
concerns in Applicant’s favor, based on the mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 17(b) (“omission or concealment 
was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel”) and 
AG ¶ 17(f) (“the information was unsubstantiated”).

 Applicant is an intelligent, well-educated adult. She was candid, sincere, and 
credible at the hearing. Her expertise is in data base management, not financial 
management, and she is unfamiliar with the arcane world of security clearance 
determinations. She has been dealing with delinquent debts for most of her adult life, 
beginning while she was on active duty in the Army.  
 
 Applicant has made a number of good decisions during the past year. She 
started tracking her spending habits, obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, 
separated her finances from her husband’s, obtained financial counseling, and adopted 
a reasonable budget. She has a good income and is living modestly. What is missing is 
a track record of financial responsibility long enough to demonstrate that she will not fall 
back into old habits. Less than a year has passed since her bankruptcy discharge. More 
time is needed for her to demonstrate that she is willing and able to be financially 
responsible.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and 
E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has refuted the allegations of falsification under Guideline E, but she has not 
mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F. Accordingly, I conclude she has not 
carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set 
forth in the SOR, as required by Directive ¶ E3.1.25: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:    Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
