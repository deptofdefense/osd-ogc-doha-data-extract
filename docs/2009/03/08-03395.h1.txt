Decision

GALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 9, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline 
F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

It should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated 
revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) 
published a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative 
Guidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the 
SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant’s 
case because her SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on an unspecified date. In a sworn, 
written statement, dated September 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 2, 2008, and 
the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard on December 8, 
2008. It was reassigned to me on January 5, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on January 27, 2009. 
 
During the hearing, four Government exhibits and seven Applicant exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) was received on February 5, 2009. 
 
The record was kept open until February 10, 2009, to enable Applicant to 
supplement the record.  Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on February 
10, 2009, she submitted one additional document (marked as Applicant Exhibit H) which 
was admitted into evidence without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a majority of the factual allegations 
in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., 1.e. through 1.l., 1.n., and 1.o.). She denied the remaining 
allegations. 
 
Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking 
to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  She currently 
holds an interim clearance. Applicant has never been married,1 but does have three 
children born in 1998, 2001, and 2005, respectively.2 As of January 27, 2009, she 
resided with her children and fiancé, the father of her youngest child.3 She has been 
gainfully employed by the same defense contractor since October 2007, and currently

serves as a purchasing agent.4 Her previous employment included a lengthy period 
(2001-07) as a customer service representative.  She was unemployed for a two month 
period in 2007.5  
 
It is unclear when Applicant’s finances commenced a downward spiral, but the 
various credit reports in evidence would seem to indicate her problems started about 
the time some accounts were sent to collection as early as 2003-04. Part of her financial 
difficulties arose from her immaturity and fiscal irresponsibility,6 and part arose from her 
gullibility in permitting her former fiancé to purchase items on her joint or individual 
credit only to resell them for cash which he then used for his own purposes. Applicant 
apparently ignored her debts, and, as a result, several accounts became delinquent and 
were either “charged off” or placed for collection. With additional maturity and a growing 
sense of responsibility, and after completing her e-QIP, she eventually came to the 
realization that her actions were inappropriate. In an effort to correct her financial 
circumstances, she turned to a credit counselor for financial guidance in late November 
or early December 2007.7 She was told to continue ignoring her delinquent debts until 
2010, at which time those debts would drop off her credit report.8 Not feeling 
comfortable with such guidance, she ignored it and commenced her initial efforts of 
addressing those delinquencies.9 
 
The first step in her effort to correct and reestablish credit occurred in early 2008, 
when she called most of her identifiable creditors to verify her responsibility for the 
accounts and their balances, and try to negotiate reduced balances and payment 
terms.10 In conjunction with her efforts to take care of her outstanding debts, Applicant’s 
fiancé pays the current bills such as rent, utilities, and those requiring immediate 
attention.11   
 
The SOR identified 16 purportedly continuing delinquencies. She disputed 
responsibility for one account, claiming it was a joint account she had with her father, 
and it had been discharged by her father’s bankruptcy in 2003-04.12 Some of the 
accounts have been paid off and others are in the process of being paid under an

agreed payment plan. She also disputed several accounts as being the responsibility of 
her former fiancé, and believes several of the SOR allegations refer to duplicate 
accounts.   Those debts listed in the SOR, and their respective current status, according 
to the credit reports, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:

SOR & 1.a. refers to telephone service Applicant obtained for her mother who 
ran up a long distance bill that Applicant was unable to pay.13 The account was

eventually sent to collection and, although Applicant has not yet addressed it, she 
intends to do so after some of her other debts are paid off.14 
 
SOR & 1.b. refers to a store credit card that became delinquent, so it was sent to 
collection.  In September 2008, Applicant entered into negotiations with the collection 
attorneys representing the creditor, and later that month, paid the agreed outstanding 
balance in full.15 
 
SOR & 1.c. refers to a credit card that became delinquent. The account was 
charged off.16 Prior to November 2007, Applicant attempted to negotiate payment 
arrangements with the creditor, but her efforts to do so were thwarted when the creditor 
refused to accept less than the entire balance in one lump sum payment.17 She intends 
to pay the outstanding balance after she has resolved some of the other debts.18 
 
SOR & 1.d. refers to an automobile loan Applicant and her former fiancé 
obtained for his automobile.  The original loan was for $10,000, and monthly payments 
were apparently made by her former fiancé for an unspecified period before ceasing. 
The account eventually went into collection and was charged off,19 and the vehicle was 
repossessed and subsequently sold at auction,20 leaving a deficiency balance of 
$2,317. All the correspondence, including the collection correspondence, was mailed to 
his address, and Applicant was unaware that the payments had stopped, or the vehicle 
had been repossessed.21 Applicant and the attorneys for the creditor agreed to an initial 
payment plan, and she made monthly payments for about one year before finding 
herself unable to continue. When she asked her former fiancé for assistance, he agreed 
to make some payments, but he failed to follow through.22 Another payment plan was 
commenced in May 2008, when she made an initial payment of $1,100, and that plan 
has continued with monthly payments of $100 being made by her.23 She intends to

when she is able to do so.24 
 
 SOR && 1.e., 1.k., and 1.n. refer to medical bills which should have been timely 
submitted to MEDICAID by the billing departments of the medical providers, but were 
not.  Applicant attempted to dispute her responsibility for the accounts but obtained no 
favorable resolution. As a result, she has accepted responsibility for the bills and 
intended to pay them off commencing in February 2009.25 
 
SOR & 1.f. refers to a credit card that became delinquent, so it was sent to 
collection.26 Sometime prior to January 2009, Applicant entered into negotiations with 
the collection attorneys representing the creditor, and a payment plan was agreed to 
under which she made, on January 5, 2009, the first of three $200 monthly payments to 
satisfy her indebtedness.27 
 
SOR & 1.g. refers to a store credit card that became delinquent, so it was sent to 
collection.28 In May 2008, Applicant entered into negotiations with the collection agency 
representing the creditor,29 and the matter was finally ironed out in January 2009, when 
it was agreed that the balance would be adjusted to $689.53, and it would be paid by 
February 2, 2009.30  The account has been paid off. 
 
SOR & 1.h. refers to a credit card account Applicant and her father held jointly.31 
The account became delinquent and was sent to collection.32 It was subsequently 
transferred to another lender, and she thought her responsibility was eventually 
discharged through her father’s bankruptcy under Chapter 7.33  
 
SOR & 1.i. refers to a store charge account that Applicant and her former fiancé 
held jointly. She never saw the card and never used it.34 The account became

delinquent over 180 days,35 and Applicant attempted to dispute it because the charges 
were incurred by her former fiancé.36 She has now accepted responsibility for the 
account, but because of the substantial balance, she intends to address the account 
once she has taken care of some of the others.37 
 
SOR & 1.j. refers to a payday loan she had received.  Each time she made 
payments toward the loan, the creditor enticed her into applying for more money, and 
she “fell into a poor-judgment hole.”38 The account became delinquent, was sent to 
collection, and was eventually charged off.39 On January 26, 2009, the day before the 
hearing, Applicant paid off the remaining balance of $215.80.40 
 
SOR & 1.l. refers to a credit card that became delinquent, so it was sent to 
collection.41 In January 2009, Applicant reached a settlement with the collection 
attorneys representing the creditor, and agreed to make an initial payment, by “auto-
draft,”42 of $1,141 by January 31, 2009, and a final payment of $349 by February 28, 
2009.43 
 
SOR & 1.m. refers to a credit card which Applicant does not recognize and 
claims is a duplication of the allegation set for in SOR & 1.l.44 Applicant has attempted 
to identify the account by contacting the attorney for the creditor to determine if the 
accounts are one and the same or separate, and if they turn out to be the same 
account, she will address it.45 She simply wants to avoid paying twice for the same 
account.46 Government Exhibit 3 (a credit report) and Applicant Exhibit A (another credit 
report) are substantially less than clear and are thus, inconclusive.   
 
SOR & 1.o. refers to a mobile telephone service account. Applicant contends the 
account was on a monthly basis, and following a dispute she decided to cancel the

service.47 Rather than comply with her instructions, the creditor charged her for a 
disconnection fee, an action which she unsuccessfully disputed.48 The account was 
sent to collection.49 Applicant intends to satisfy the account by the end of February or 
beginning of March 2009.50 
 
SOR & 1.p. refers to a store credit card account that Applicant and her former 
fiancé held jointly. Together, they used the card one time to purchase a set of tires.51 
That balance was paid off, but the account remained open.52 Applicant’s former fiancé 
apparently purchased another set of tires and resold them, leaving her with the unpaid 
balance.53 The account apparently became delinquent, and Applicant attempted to 
dispute it because the charges were incurred by him. Her efforts were unsuccessful 
because the account was supposedly sold to a collection agency with whom she has 
dealt for another account. The collection agency told her they did not have the identified 
delinquent account.54 Neither of the two credit reports submitted by the Government 
lists the account. Nevertheless, Applicant has now accepted responsibility for the 
account, and intends to address it in June or July 2009.55   
 
With the exception of her delinquent debts, Applicant’s finances are otherwise 
unremarkable, and she has no other financial issues or difficulties.56 According to her 
most recent Personal Financial Statement, completed in June 2008, Applicant has a 
monthly sum of over $3,343 for discretionary expenses.57 She and her current fiancé 
combine their income and share expenses. He pays the monthly household 
expenses,58 and she pays her delinquent accounts.59 She has learned her lesson about

Despite her financial delinquencies, Applicant’s performance has not suffered. 
Her most recent performance evaluation, issued in December 2008, reflects an 
individual whose overall performance is rated as “exceptional,” the highest rating 
possible.62 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”63 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon 
a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”64   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”65 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

65 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
 
10 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.66  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.  Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.”67 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”68 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to

protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit 
reports, answer to the SOR, her answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including 
her testimony, presented during the hearing. The Government has established AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c).   
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ 
In addition, when “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” AG ¶ 20(b) may apply. Evidence that Athe 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating 
under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.@69 Also, AG & 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue” may apply. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) or 20(e) 
because she did not act more aggressively, timely, and responsibly to resolve her 
delinquent debts. Those delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under 
69 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good faith” mitigating condition].

the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence.70 Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(a) 
because her financial problems “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(e) applies because she disputed some of the SOR debts, 
either because they were incurred by someone else, were caused by a breakdown in 
medical filing, were believed to have been discharged under her father’s bankruptcy, or 
she could not recognize the creditor or had reason to believe there was some 
duplication of debts listed in her credit report.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies because Applicant’s financial situation was damaged when 
her former fiancé ran up bills on their joint accounts, without her knowledge or approval; 
and when medical providers failed to submit bills in a timely manner to MEDICAID, 
causing the full responsibility to fall on Applicant, rather than be shared or totally 
covered by MEDICAID. Initially, she lacked the income to pay some of her debts, but 
with counseling and greater maturity, she commenced negotiations with creditors and 
started paying her SOR debts. While it may have taken some time, this 26-year old 
Applicant matured and eventually established that she acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.71  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial counseling and guidance 
in late November or early December 2007, well before the issuance of the SOR. She 
was told to continue ignoring her delinquent debts until 2010, at which time those debts 
would drop off her credit report.  But to her credit, and not feeling comfortable with such 
guidance, she ignored that irresponsible advice and commenced her initial efforts of 
addressing those delinquencies.  There are now “clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.” She understands the security implications of her 
earlier inaction pertaining to delinquent debt and intends to scrupulously avoid future 
delinquent debt. 
 
She has also established mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because Applicant showed 
good faith in her efforts to resolve her SOR debts.  She has established a reasonable 
plan to continue to do so.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
70 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 16, 2002)). 
 
71 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).  
 
13 
                                      
 
                                                          
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my analysis below.      
There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. As noted above, part of 
her financial difficulties arose from her immaturity and fiscal irresponsibility, and part 
arose from her gullibility in permitting her former fiancé to purchase items on her joint or 
individual credit only to resell them for cash which he then used for his own purposes. 
Applicant also apparently ignored her debts, and, as a result, several accounts became 
delinquent and were either “charged off” or placed for collection. She has admitted to 
having been financially irresponsible and gullible as a young adult.  She ignored her 
valid debts and they became delinquent. Most of the delinquent accounts were sent to 
collection or charged off, and in one instance, a motor vehicle was repossessed.  
 The mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. 
With additional maturity and a growing sense of responsibility, and after looking at her 
credit score and realizing she was a poor role model for her children, and 
acknowledging the fact that she was no longer a teenager,72 she eventually came to the 
realization that her actions were inappropriate. There is no evidence of any security 
violation, and to the contrary, she is considered a valued employee who is an 
exceptional performer. She is a law-abiding citizen. She started to address her 
delinquent debts and has paid off some of them, has agreements to pay off others, and 
intends to satisfy any remaining debts in the near future. Her personal payment plan is 
in place and being followed, and she has no new delinquent debts. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in 
financial cases stating:73 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
72 Tr. at 46-47. 
 
73 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).

resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a high school graduate, who started attending college in 2007. She is 
not sophisticated in the area of finance, and has experienced substantial financial 
difficulties, primarily because of her immaturity and gullibility. She made mistakes, and 
debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. 
Moreover, with substantial maturity, she has established a “meaningful track record” of 
debt payments by actually paying some of her delinquent SOR debts, setting up 
arrangements with others, and setting up her personal plan to resolve the remaining 
debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude she has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative 
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant 
has mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude 
she is eligible for access to classified information.
