DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access 
to classified information is granted. 
 
On October 12, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP), in reapplication for a Secret security clearance. On 
June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs 
issued after September 1, 2006.

 Applicant answered the SOR on or about August 4, 2008, and waived his right to 
a hearing. In accordance with Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural Guidance 
at Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6, Department Counsel requested a hearing. 
(Hearing Exhibit 1)  DOHA assigned the case to me on December 5, 2008, and issued a 
Notice of Hearing on January 7, 2009. The case was heard on January 28, 2009 as 
scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified, called one character witness and offered exhibits 
(AE) A through D into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left 
the record open until February 13, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit 
additional information. On February 12, 2009, Applicant submitted an exhibit that I 
marked as AE E and admitted into the record without objection from the Government. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 6, 2009.                                                           
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant denied the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the SOR.1  
 
 Applicant is 56 years old and married. He has four adult children. He earned a 
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1974 and has worked for a federal 
contractor for the past 35 years. He is a senior manager for a weapons program.  
Applicant held a Secret clearance since 1974, except for a three-year period from 1997 
until 2000, when it was administratively revoked, while he was going through the re-
investigation process and he failed to promptly supply information. (Tr. 9; 38)   
 
 Applicant has lived in several states over the years. From 1981 until 1994, he 
lived in Georgia. From September 1994 to August 1997, he lived in California. From 
September 1997 to May 2000, he lived in Georgia. He returned to California in June 
2000 and lived there until September 2001. He moved to Missouri in October 2001, 
where he currently resides.  
 
 Paragraph 1(a) of the SOR alleged: “You are indebted to the State of California 
as the result of your failure to file your personal income tax returns for 1993 through 
2001, resulting in a tax lien in the approximate amount of $14,286. As of May 11, 2008, 
$9,975 remains to be paid and you have yet to file a return for 2001.” 
 
 Applicant did not reside in California in 1993. He filed his 1994 return on April 17, 
1995, the 1995 return on April 15, 1996, the 1996 return on April 15, 1997, and the 1997 
return on April 15, 1998. He did not reside in California in 1998 or 1999. He filed a part-
time resident 2000 return on August 15, 2001. He filed his 2001 return on August 16, 
2007, six years late. He failed to file it timely for several reasons. Due to geographic 
transfers in his employment in 2000 and 2001, he bought and sold two homes and used 
monies from his 401(k), along with a large transfer bonus for one of the purchases. His 
employer changed the payroll deduction system around this time, generating multiple 
                                            
1The SOR incorrectly numbered the second paragraph as Paragraph 3, and not as Paragraph 2.  
 
 
 
 
3
W-2 forms, some of which contained errors that had to be corrected.2 In addition to the 
complications with the W-2 forms and additional taxes owed because of a bonus and 
401(k) withdrawal, he had difficulty calculating his taxes and gathering the information. 
After filing the 2001 return in 2007, he received a tax bill for $4,500 that he paid in July 
2008. He subsequently received another notification from California that he owed an 
additional $1,500 that he paid in January 2009. The 2008 tax lien was released on 
January 8, 2009. All matters are resolved. He admitted that he should have sought help 
with the 2001 complicated return and filed it much sooner. (Tr. 39-49; AE C)  
 
 Paragraph 1(b) of the SOR alleged: “You failed to file your federal tax returns for 
years 1993 through 1999. As a result the IRS filed a lien against you in the approximate 
amount of $5,706, which was satisfied and released in 2004, only after the IRS applied 
your tax refunds from years 2000 to 2003 as an offset.” 
 
 Applicant filed his 1993 federal return on February 14, 2994, his 1994 return on 
April 17, 1995, the 1995 return on April 15, 1996, the 1996 return on April 15, 1997, the 
1997 return on April 15, 1998, and the 1998 return on April 15, 1999. (AE A) All of these 
were timely filed. (Tr. 50-54; AE D; Response: Attachment 3) Department Counsel 
acknowledged that the allegations filed under Paragraph 1(b) were incorrectly alleged 
as the returns were filed well before the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 54; 95) 
 
 Paragraph 1(c) of the SOR alleged: “You failed to file your personal income tax 
return with the State of Georgia for tax years 1987 through 1992.” 
 
 Applicant filed his 1987 Georgia return on November 15, 1991, and his 1988 and 
1989 returns on June 20, 1999. All three of these were late. He was entitled to receive 
refunds for each of those years, but did not because of the late filings. He admitted the 
late filings, and attributed the delay to moving during that period, his daughter’s illness, 
financial over-extension, potential foreclosure problems, all of which resulted in tax 
liabilities that he could not pay.3 In addition, he had not timely filed his federal taxes for 
the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, further exacerbating the situation.4 Because he 
anticipated receiving a refund from the state for those years, he procrastinated. He 
acknowledges his error. He timely filed his 1990, 1991 and 1992 state returns. (AE D; 
Response: Attachment 4)  All matters relating to the tax returns for these six years are 
resolved.  (Tr. 54-62) 
 
 Paragraph 1(d) of the SOR alleged: “You failed to file your federal tax returns 
with the I.R.S. for tax years 2005 and 2006, owing approximately $6,577 including 
interest and penalties. As of March 8, 2008 this debt has not bene [sic] paid.” 
 
 Applicant filed his 2005 federal return on April 16, 2006. He paid $7,575 on July 
15, 2006, and made an additional payment of $274 in May 2007. This year is resolved. 
                                            
2Applicant noted these problems in his January 2000 Statement of Subject. (GE 6)  
3Applicant noted these problems in his January 1997 Statement of Subject. (GE 3)  
4He filed his federal 1987, 1988 and 1989 tax returns in November 1991.   
 
 
 
 
4
He filed his 2006 federal return on August 14, 2007, after receiving an extension. He 
made the $6,566 final payment on the taxes on August 1, 2008. This year is resolved. 
(Response: Attachment 5; Tr. 63-66)  
 
 Applicant timely filed his 2007 state and federal returns. He later received a 
$2,000 refund from the state. On January 14, 2009, the IRS notified him that he had an 
outstanding tax liability of $2,113 on his 2007 taxes. He admitted that he should have 
sought help with the complicated return. In accordance with an installment payment 
plan he negotiated with the IRS, he mailed a $500 check to the government on January 
28, 2009, reducing that tax balance to about $1,650.5 
 
 From 1987 until 2007, Applicant was required to file yearly state and federal tax 
returns for a total of 40 returns.  All of those returns were timely filed, except eight 
returns: his 1987, 1988 and 1989 federal tax returns were filed in November 1991; his 
2001 federal return was filed in November 2003; his 1987 Georgia return was filed in 
November 1991; his 1988 and 1989 Georgia returns were filed in June 1999; and his 
2001 California return was filed in August 2007. All state and federal taxes owed for 
those twenty years are resolved. (AE E) 
 
 Applicant admitted that he previously had problems filing his returns on time and 
owing sizeable amounts of money to the Government at tax time. In order to correct that 
problem and prevent its recurrence, he has increased the amount of money withheld 
from his paycheck by an additional $7,200 annually. (Tr. 70-72; 86; AE E) That 
additional withholding should cover any tax shortage at the end of future tax years. (Tr. 
87-88)  
 
 Applicant’s net monthly income is $8,170. (AE E). His expenses are about 
$8,040, including payments on two mortgages, a car loan, and six credit cards, leaving 
about $130 per month, according to his August 2007 budget. (Response: Attachment 3) 
The budget does not contain the $500 monthly installment payment for his 2008 tax 
liability, which will be paid in three months. However, it appears that he is able to pay 
that based on the payments he made in December 2008 and January 2009. He and his 
wife have a budget established for the next three years that will track their expenses, 
spending, and promote savings. (Tr. 91-92)                                                                                             
 
 Applicant‘s immediate supervisor testified. He currently supervises about 150 
people and a $400 billion program. He has held a Secret clearance for 24 years.  He 
has known Applicant for seven years and is aware of his tax issues. He has “found 
[Applicant] to be a dependable, reliable, trustworthy, a morally and ethically sound who 
possess impeccable character and integrity.” (Tr. 27) He has no reservation in 
recommending him for a security clearance. (Tr. 27)  
 
 Applicant presented his case in a very organized and detailed manner. He spent 
a great deal of time gathering documents since the SOR was issued, and he appears to

have a comprehensive understanding of the situation, as well as his finances. He 
realizes the importance of complying with tax filing requirements and monitoring his 
withholding monies. Throughout his testimony, he was candid, remorseful and 
embarrassed by this situation. (Tr. 93-94)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, “The applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.” Section 7 
of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
 
 
 
 
6
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and maybe be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or 
the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for the years 1987, 1988, 
1989, and 2001. He also failed to timely file state returns for 1987, 1988, 1989, and 
2001. The evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition. 
 
After the Government produced substantial evidence of those two 
disqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove 
mitigation of the resulting security concern. AG ¶ 20 includes six conditions that could 
mitigate security concerns arising under this guideline: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
 
 
7
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. 
AG ¶ 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant filed a state 2001 tax return in 
August 2007, which is too recent to trigger the application of this condition, given his 
previous history of late filings.  Although there were certain circumstances that arose in 
the late 1980’s and again in 2000 to 2001, which complicated his tax situation, none of 
them justified the late filings. Hence, AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. He presented evidence 
indicating that he is addressing the situation and that there are “clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control,” warranting the application of AG ¶ 20(c). 
He has also paid all previously owed taxes, such that AG ¶ 20(d) is applicable. The 
record evidence does not support the application of  AG ¶ 20(e) or AG ¶ 20(f). 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out 
in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and maybe 
disqualifying in this case: 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: 
 
 
 
 
8
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of 
client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, 
unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other 
government protected information: 
(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the 
workplace;  
(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, 
(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government of other 
employer’s time or resources. 
 
Based on the evidence, Applicant’s failure to file state and federal tax returns in 
1987, 1988, 1989, and 2001 demonstrate a pattern of poor judgment and rule violations, 
sufficient to raise the above disqualification.   
 
AG ¶ 17 describes a condition that could mitigate the disqualification raised in 
this case: 
 
 (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained 
counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to 
alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused 
untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such 
behavior is unlikely to recur. 
 
Applicant acknowledged his behavior and is remorseful. He has increased 
the amount of his monthly withholding taxes, in order to prevent a similar problem 
from arising in the future. He and his wife have also established a long-range 
budget that will help them maintain financial responsibility and avoid additional 
late tax filing problems. The above mitigating condition is applicable to his 
previous pattern of failure to timely file tax returns.   
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). They include the following:  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
 
 
 
9
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 56-year-old man, who 
has a 35-year successful work history with his employer. He began experiencing 
personal and financial difficulties from 1987 through 1989, and again in 2000 and 2001, 
attributable to family issues, financial over-extension, and geographical transfers. From 
1987 to 2007, he filed eight tax returns significantly late. He filed the other 32 tax 
returns, required during that period, within the legal time limits.  He understands the 
underlying reasons for the late filings and takes full responsibility for his actions. He 
admitted that he should have sought help with the complicated returns, and I suspect he 
will in the future, if necessary. With his new budget, he should be able to avoid similar 
payment problems, given the amount of money he earns. He was a candid and credible 
witness. His supervisor is aware of the issues and continues to strongly support him. 
There is minimal potential for exploitation or likelihood of a recurrence.    
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations and 
personal conduct.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   For Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 3, Guideline E:6     FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 3.a:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
