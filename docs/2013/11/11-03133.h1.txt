Tuider, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges five delinquent debts, totaling 
$562,072, false statements in a security context, and termination from employment for 
cause. Due to circumstances beyond his control, he had insufficient financial resources 
to pay his debts. He settled and paid one debt, and the other four were resolved through 
short sales. He did not intentionally mislead the Government in his security 
documentation. Financial considerations and personal conduct concerns are mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 1, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
January 31, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On April 3, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he gave indications he 
wanted a hearing. On June 11, 2013, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On June 21, 2013, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me. On June 11, 2013, DOHA issued a 
hearing notice, setting the hearing for August 2, 2013. Applicant’s hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 10 exhibits, and Applicant offered 14 
exhibits. (Tr. 22-23; GE 1-10; AE A-N) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-
10 and AE A-N. (Tr. 22-23) The record was held open after the hearing until September 
18, 2013 for additional evidence. On August 12, 2013, DOHA received the transcript of 
the hearing. On September 18, 2013, Department Counsel provided 10 documents from 
Applicant, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (AE O-AA)      
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.1 He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old mechanical engineer, who works for a defense 
contractor providing base operations services. (Tr. 27-28, 56, 58, 60-61; GE 1) He 
graduated from high school in 1996, and he was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 
mechanical engineering in 2003. (Tr. 57, 119; GE 1) He never served in the military. 
(GE 1) He never married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 91-92; GE 1) He has 
never been arrested or convicted of a crime. (Tr. 57) He has had access to classified 
information for three years. (Tr. 93) There are no allegations of security violations, and 
he has not been disciplined by his employer. (Tr. 61-62)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 2005, Applicant decided to invest in real estate with his mother. (Tr. 57, 62-63) 
Applicant did not have any financial or real estate training. (Tr. 113) Applicant 
purchased three duplexes and one triplex that were located near each other for a total 
of about $660,000. (Tr. 63-64, 109) He paid $60,000 and borrowed the rest. (Tr. 95-96) 
Applicant’s mother did not contribute towards the down payment. (Tr. 115) Applicant 
and his mother co-signed on the loans. (Tr. 64) He had to take out private mortgage 
                                            
1
His answer to the SOR did not include an answer to SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.e. (Tr. 10) He denied 
intentionally attempting to mislead the Government on his SF 86, and he admitted being terminated from 
employment, but he asserted the termination was unjustified. (Tr. 11-12) 
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
insurance (PMI) because he did not make a sufficient down payment (usually 20 
percent) to satisfy the mortgage company. (Tr. 96) His mortgage payments on the rental 
properties totaled about $4,500 each month. (Tr. 109) Applicant also purchased the 
home where he lived, and the two mortgage debts in SOR ¶ 1.d ($68,112) and ¶ 1.e 
($124,800) financed the purchase of his personal residence. (Tr. 64-65, 98-100)  
 
Applicant had a negative cash flow on the rental properties because they were 
vacant or the tenants did not pay their rent. (Tr. 38-39, 50, 66, 114) He withdrew about 
$20,000 from his IRA accounts to make payments on his mortgages. (Tr. 68) He began 
to miss payments on the mortgages in 2009. (Tr. 111) Later, he made some payments 
and tried to get caught up on his payments. (Tr. 112) The value of the properties 
decreased, and their fair market value fell below the amount of their mortgages. (Tr. 
114-115) He considered abandoning the properties or filing for bankruptcy; however, he 
chose to take a harder, more responsible route to debt resolution. (Tr. 40, 53, 70)  
 
Applicant hired lawyers and utilized real estate agents to generate short sales. 
(Tr. 71) The banks initiated foreclosures; however, the foreclosures were dismissed 
after three short sales. (Tr. 39, 43, 50, 72, 100) He provided proof of resolution for the 
debts in the SOR as follows: ¶ 1.a ($199,160) (GE 10-12; AE C, P, Z, AA, BB); ¶ 1.b 
($149,000) (GE 8, 9; AE P, W, X, Y); ¶ 1.d ($68,122) (GE 4, 5; AE P); and ¶ 1.e 
($124,800) (AE B, H, P, Q, R). There were no deficiency judgments executed against 
Applicant or his mother. (Tr. 72) Three short sales resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. (Tr. 100-101, 118; AE G, H) He received one 1099 form, which he 
provided to DOHA. (Tr. 107-108; GE 4) 
 
A PMI debt for $21,000 was settled and paid, using $5,000 of Applicant’s cash, a 
$5,000 loan from his fiancé, and a $5,000 loan from his father. (Tr. 43-44, 101; SOR ¶ 
1.c; GE 6; AE P, S, V) He repaid the loans from his father and his fiancé. (Tr. 44)  
 
Applicant drives a 2002 Toyota, and he only has one credit card. The balance on 
his credit card is about $7,000 and that account is current. (Tr. 59-60, 94) He does not 
owe any personal loans. (Tr. 60) His gross annual income is about $60,000. 
 
Personal Conduct   
 
When Applicant completed his October 1, 2010 SF 86, he disclosed that he went 
to Thailand for 14 days in 2008. (GE 1) He also disclosed his travel to other foreign 
countries on his SF 86. (GE 1) He has not traveled outside the United States since his 
2008 trip to Thailand. (Tr. 101)  
 
When Applicant completed his October 1, 2010 SF 86, he answered, “No” in 
response to financial questions in section 26 about: property being repossessed (26.b); 
defaulting on any loan (26.f); debts over 180 days delinquent in the previous seven 
years (26.m), and debts currently delinquent over 90 days (26.n). (GE 1; SOR ¶ 2.b) His 
answer with respect to foreclosures was correct because no foreclosure judgments had 
been entered against Applicant. (Tr. 77-78) He knew the mortgages were in litigation

status or that he was working with the banks; he was unsure of the legal status of his 
mortgages; and he chose to answer “No” to all of the financial questions. (Tr. 79, 117)  
  
When Applicant completed his October 1, 2010 SF 86, he disclosed the following 
employments: from January 2003 to April 2008 with company C (13A.4); from May 2008 
(estimated) to May 2010 (estimated) with company T (13A.3); from May 2010 to June 
2010 with company C (13A.2); and from July 2010 to the present with his current 
employer (13A.1). (GE 1) He disclosed that he was fired from company C in April 2008 
(13C.1). (Tr. 83; GE 1)2 SOR ¶ 2.c alleges he failed to disclose unemployment from 
May 2008 to June 2008 in response to question 13A, and part-time employment with 
company W from October 2008 to February 2009. (GE 1) SOR ¶ 2.d alleges he failed to 
disclose that he was “laid off” from company W in February 2009. (GE 1)  
 
Applicant explained that he failed to disclose his employment with company W on 
his SF 86 out of an oversight or carelessness. (Tr. 80) On his 2008 and 2009 federal 
income tax returns, he disclosed his income and employment as a mechanical engineer 
with company W. (Tr. 80-82; AE M, N) His work with company W was unrelated to his 
primary employment with the Government contractor. (Tr. 82-83) He was laid off from 
employment with company W because business was slow and he was a part-time 
employee. (Tr. 85)  
 
On November 23, 2010, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant, who disclosed that he knew Mr. P and visited him in Thailand in 
2008. (Tr. 75; GE 3 at 6) Applicant met Mr. P when they worked together at an island in 
the Pacific. (Tr. 75) His visit with Mr. P in Thailand was for social purposes and not 
based on his employment. (Tr. 76) Applicant traveled to several foreign countries over 
the years. (Tr. 77) He also disclosed his part-time employment with company W. (Tr. 
85-86) 
 
On August 3, 2012, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. (SOR ¶ 2.a; 
GE 9) He disclosed the name of an acquaintance, Mr. P, who lives in Thailand. (GE 9) 
He said he had hundreds of contacts with Mr. P, as they used to work together, and 
they were friends “many years ago”; however, he erroneously left question 13 blank, 
which asks about foreign contacts. (GE 9) He also responded “No” to question 11 about 
whether he had a friend or associate who lives in a foreign country. (Tr. 73-74, 102; GE 
9) He maintained a social relationship with P after leaving Thailand by occasionally 
talking to him on the telephone or over a social network. (Tr. 103)   
 
If answering the same questions today, Applicant would disclose the information 
about his delinquent mortgages, part-time employment, and contact with his friend, who 
lives in Thailand. (Tr. 79, 87, 117) Applicant denied that he intended to deceive the 
Government about these issues on his SF 86. (Tr. 79, 87)

SOR ¶ 2.e indicates that Applicant was terminated from company C “for cause” in April 2008. 
Applicant explained he had a disagreement with his supervisor, and he was rehired in May 2010. (Tr. 84) 
He denied that the termination from employment with company C in April 2008 was for misconduct or for 
the quality of his work. (Tr. 87-88)

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s fiancé and Applicant plan to marry in May 2014. (Tr. 37) They met in 
December 2006. (Tr. 38, 54) She paid for their home in cash using her inheritance, and 
there is no lien on it. (Tr. 38, 49) She was a foreclosure attorney from 2008 to 2011. (Tr. 
39, 53) She described Applicant as a rational, honest, responsible, and trustworthy 
person, who does not abuse alcohol or illegal drugs. (Tr. 39-55) 
 
An employee of the contractor has known Applicant or worked with him for 10 
years. (Tr. 26-27, 33) For the last three years, he has been Applicant’s immediate 
supervisor. (Tr. 27) He described Applicant’s work performance as above average to 
excellent. (Tr. 28) Applicant is personable, honest, knowledgeable, professional, 
compliant with rules, trustworthy, and loyal. (Tr. 30-34) He has high confidence in 
Applicant, and no concerns about Applicant’s access to classified information. (Tr. 30-
32)  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM interview, SOR response, and statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s debts became delinquent in 2009. Applicant’s SOR alleges five 
delinquent mortgage debts, totaling $562,072. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
to 20(d). AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not dispute any of his SOR debts. 
The unexpected decline in value of real estate and failure of his tenants to pay their rent 
in full and on time caused Applicant to have debts he could not afford to pay. His 
financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond his control. He made 
$20,000 in payments from his 401k accounts; however, he was unable to keep the 
mortgage accounts current. He arranged four short sales and paid $15,000 to settle one 
PMI debt. His SOR debts are all resolved, and his only debt, a credit card account, is 
now current.3

 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
The Appeal Board explained that circumstances beyond one’s control can cause 
unresolved debt, and are not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-

ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). Applicant admitted 
responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, 
establishing some good faith.4 He established and maintained contact with his 
creditors.5 He used his limited resources to settle and pay one $15,000 debt, and he 
took reasonable actions to resolve the four mortgage debts through short sales. His 
financial problem is resolved, and his finances are under control. Applicant has learned 
from his financial mistakes, they are unlikely to recur; and they do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His efforts are sufficient to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns.

The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the 
adjudication of Applicant’s security clearance in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 
  
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;6  
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: 
 
                                            
6
The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; 
 
(2) . . . inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  
 
(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; or 
 
(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time 
or resources; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing. 
 
I find Applicant’s statements explaining why he did not provide derogatory 
financial information about his delinquent mortgages, did not provide complete 
employment information, and did not provide complete and correct information about his 
friendship with Mr. P, a resident of Thailand, to be credible. His omissions and 
misstatements were errors made through carelessness and oversights. He refuted the 
allegations that he intentionally falsified his October 1, 2010 SF 86 and provided 
incorrect and incomplete information in his responses to DOHA interrogatories. He 
regrets his mistakes, and he would not make the same mistakes today.  
 
SOR ¶ 2.e indicates Applicant left his employment with company C in April 2008 
for cause. He left the employment because of a disagreement with his supervisor, was 
subsequently rehired by the same company that terminated him, and his supervisor for 
the last three years lauds his diligence and contributions to the company. This allegation 
does not meet the threshold requirement for AG ¶¶ 16(d) or 16(e). 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this 
case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability. 
 
AG ¶ 17(a) applies to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.b to 2.d. Applicant did not 
provide derogatory financial information about his delinquent mortgages, and he did not 
provide complete employment information on his October 1, 2010 SF 86. He discussed 
the missing information on his November 23, 2010 follow-up OPM investigative 
interview.  
 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 In the instant case, Applicant disclosed the omissions, and he fully cooperated 
with the investigator’s follow-up interrogation. Applicant’s failure to provide derogatory 
financial information about his delinquent mortgages and his failure to provide complete 
employment information on his October 1, 2010 SF 86 were improper. He failed to 
disclose this information out of carelessness and not with the intent to deceive the 
Government. He disclosed the missing information during his November 23, 2010 OPM 
interview. He corrected the omission, concealment, or falsification in good faith. His 
disclosure of the information eliminated any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or 
duress. Guideline E concerns are mitigated; however, assuming AG ¶¶ 17(a), 17(e), 
and 17(f) are not applicable, security concerns are separately mitigated under the 
whole-person concept, infra.7  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old mechanical engineer, who works for a defense 
contractor providing base operations services. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 
mechanical engineering in 2003. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply 
with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for supporting the U.S.

In ISCR Case No. 09-05655 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2010), the applicant intentionally denied that 
he had private employment on his security clearance application (SCA) to conceal that employment from 
his employer. Fifty-one days later, ISCR Case No. 09-05655 at 5 (A.J. May 12, 2010), at his OPM 
interview, he “(1) corrected the omission in his SCA without first having been confronted with the facts; 
and (2) cooperated with the follow-up questioning by the investigator.” ISCR Case No. 09-05655 at 2 
(App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2010). The underlying security concern about that applicant’s private employment was 
resolved when he resigned from that company. He also received some positive character references. The 
Appeal Board affirmed the mitigation of the intentional and recent falsification of his SCA under the whole-
person concept without ruling on the applicability of AG ¶ 17(a).

Government as an employee of a contractor. There is every indication that he is loyal to 
the United States and his employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or 
uses illegal drugs. He has never been arrested or convicted of a crime.  He has had 
access to classified information for three years, and there are no allegations of security 
violations, and he has not been disciplined by his employer. The decline in real estate 
values and his tenants’ failure to timely pay their rent contributed to his financial woes. I 
give Applicant substantial credit for admitting responsibility for his delinquent debts and 
working aggressively to resolve them. He received strong favorable endorsements from 
his supervisor and fiancé. His supervisor described Applicant as personable, honest, 
knowledgeable, professional, compliant with rules, trustworthy, and loyal.  
 
Applicant lacked financial resources and needed to resort to short sales to clear 
his mortgage debts. He borrowed money and paid his $15,000 settlement to a PMI 
company. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis 
in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). He only has one credit card, and it is current. His vehicle is 
paid off and he has no delinquent debt.   
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands what he needs to do to 
establish and maintain his financial responsibility. Moreover, he established a 
“meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he will maintain his 
financial responsibility.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.e:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
