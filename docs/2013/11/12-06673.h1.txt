HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons alleged 13 delinquent, collection, or charged-off 
debts, totaling $473,956.1 He failed to mitigate six delinquent SOR debts, totaling 
$471,414. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of progress resolving his 
financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 14, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 5) On July 23, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
                                            
1The SOR did not include the dollar amount of his first mortgage account in SOR ¶ 1.e that went 
to foreclosure of $398,588 with $45,572 past due. (Item 6 at 27)  Applicant’s charged off second 
mortgage account of $67,181 in SOR ¶ 1.d was listed in the SOR.   
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On August 12, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated August 27, 2013, was provided to him on September 4, 2013.2 Applicant did not 
respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on November 21, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.h and 1.j to 1.l. (Item 4) He 
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.m. (Item 4) He did not provide any 
corroborating documentation from creditors as part of his SOR response. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 42 years old, and he has been employed as an administrative 
assistant for a government contractor since November 2011. In 2001, he married, and 
he has four children, who were born in 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2007. He served on 
active duty in the Marine Corps from May 1991 to May 2011 and honorably retired. He 
earned some college credits over the years; however, he has not received a bachelor’s 
degree. There is no evidence of criminal arrests or convictions or use of illegal drugs or 
alcohol abuse in more than 20 years.  
 
Applicant’s attributes his financial problems to three circumstances. First, the 
interest rate on his adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) increased from 6% ($1,817) to 
8.95% ($3,089). Second, in 2008, his spouse’s pay was reduced from $81,000 to 
$62,000 per year. Third, Applicant was unemployed after retiring from the Marine Corps 
from June 2011 to October 2011. On his February 14, 2012 SF 86, he disclosed his 
delinquent first mortgage account and a delinquent car loan; however, he stated the first 
mortgage was resolved in January 2009 (estimated) through a short sale, and his car 
loan was brought to current status in November 2011. He acknowledged in response to 
DOHA interrogatories that his mortgage debt was not resolved through a short sale, and 
that it went into foreclosure. (Item 6) He said he was not aware of his other delinquent 
debts because he traveled often and his spouse was responsible for paying the family’s 
bills.  
                                            
2The DOHA transmittal letter is dated August 26, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated 
September 4, 2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt 
to submit information.  
 
3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s February 14, 2012 SF 
86 and/or his March 12, 2012 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) 
are the sources for the facts in the Statement of Facts. (Items 5, 6)

Applicant’s SOR includes six medical delinquent, collection, or charged off debts: 
(1) ¶ 1.a ($245); (2) ¶ 1.c ($790); (3) ¶ 1.f ($241); (4) ¶ 1.g ($653); (5) ¶ 1.h ($236); and 
(6) ¶ 1.m ($177).  Applicant said his son was in an accident, and TRICARE should have 
paid for the care. Applicant’s spouse complied with TRICARE’s direction that she submit 
their medical bills to their private medical insurance company first. As of March 2012, he 
had not received any follow-up requests for payment.   
 
Applicant’s SOR lists seven non-medical delinquent, collection, or charged off 
debts: (1) communications account ¶ 1.b ($210); (2) second mortgage account ¶ 1.d 
($67,181); (3) first mortgage account ¶ 1.e (unspecified amount); (4) 
telecommunications account ¶ 1.i ($200); (5) bank account ¶ 1.j ($3,882); (6) collection 
account ¶ 1.k ($213); and (7) school debt ¶ 1.l ($1,340). Applicant denied responsibility 
for the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($200) because he said he returned the 
telecommunications equipment to the telecommunications company. (Items 4, 6)   
 
In 2005, Applicant obtained a first mortgage on his residence for 80% of the 
purchase price and a second mortgage for 20% of the purchase price. The credit report 
Applicant provided showed that on January 2009, he owed a balance on his first 
mortgage of $398,588 with $45,572 past due. (Item 6 at 27) He also owed $67,181 on 
his second mortgage with $15,841 past due as of October 2010. (Item 6 at 29) In 
December 2008, Applicant moved out of his residence. (Item 5) He believes their house 
was foreclosed by the lender, and both mortgage debts were resolved through a 
foreclosure. He did not receive notice that he was being sued for a deficiency. Applicant 
lived in a non-recourse state, and the lenders cannot obtain a deficiency as a matter of 
law on purchase money mortgages. See note 8, infra.   
 
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($3,882) resulted from a loan to purchase an all-
terrain vehicle (ATV). Applicant claimed the debt was paid, and his other SOR debts 
were resolved. No proof of any payments to any SOR creditors was included in the file. 
 
Applicant’s July 2013 personal financial statement (PFS) shows he and his 
spouse’s monthly gross salary is $9,908; their monthly net salary is $8,905; and their 
monthly net remainder after subtracting expenses is $1,761.4 The four debt payments 
shown on their PFS are for two vehicle loans and two credit card accounts. No 
payments to SOR creditors are indicated on his PFS. 
 
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of mitigating information and explained that 
Applicant “shall have 30 days from the receipt of [the FORM] in which to submit a 
documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or 
explanation, as appropriate.” (FORM at 4-5) No additional information was submitted in 
response to the FORM.

11)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the

facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM PSI, responses to DOHA interrogatories, and SOR response. 
Applicant file documents 13 delinquent, collection, or charged off accounts, totaling 
$473,956 (includes his first and second mortgages on his foreclosed residence). The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all SOR debts; however, he provided some 
mitigating information. Applicant’s unemployment, spouse’s reduction in income, and 
the decrease in property values are all financial conditions largely beyond his control; 
however, he did not act responsibly under the circumstances. The increase in interest 
rate on his ARM from 6% to 8.95% is not a circumstance beyond his control because 
this increase was in his contract with the creditor when he purchased his residence. He 
did not describe any unemployment or changes in his income after he received his 
current employment in October 2011. He did not establish that he could not have done 
more to pay his creditors and provide documentation of such efforts to DOHA.   
 
Applicant disputes his responsibility for the six delinquent, collection, or charged 
off medical debts in the following SOR paragraphs: ¶ 1.a ($245); ¶ 1.c ($790); ¶ 1.f 
($241); ¶ 1.g ($653); ¶ 1.h ($236); and ¶ 1.m ($177). I have credited Applicant with 
mitigating these six medical debts as they are likely the responsibility of his private 
medical insurance or TRICARE or both, although Applicant may owe some copays on 
these medical bills. I have also credited Applicant with mitigating the 
telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($200) because he said he returned the 
telecommunications equipment to the telecommunications company, and he denied that 
he owed this debt. Applicant receives some mitigation from his PFS, which shows a 
reasonable budget and an ample monthly remainder of $1,761. He also established 
some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because he showed some good faith in the resolution 
of his SOR debts by admitting responsibility for 11 of his SOR debts.  
  
Applicant’s two mortgages and his foreclosure are more problematic. The two 
mortgages in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e are not collectable under California law.6 His first 
                                            
6Under California law, there is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency Statute, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 
§ 580(b, which states in relevant part: 
  
No deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property or an estate for 
years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or her contract of sale, or under 
a deed of trust or mortgage given to the vendor to secure payment of the balance of the 
purchase price of that real property or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or 
mortgage on a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure 
repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the purchase price of that 
dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the purchaser. 
 
Under this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a deficiency, the lender 
has no recourse regarding “purchase money loans,” also called “non-recourse loans,” the amounts set 
forth in both the 1st and the 2nd mortgages used to finance the dwelling purchase. The collateral or 
dwelling is considered full satisfaction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09662 at 9 (AJ Feb. 26, 2009) 
(quoting same provision to mitigate substantial mortgage debts—it is noted hearing-level decisions are 
persuasive but non-precedential); ISCR Case No. 08-03024 at 10-12 (AJ Apr. 28, 2009) (same result—
different state). Under California law, mortgage lenders to home owners have significant legal hurdles to 
surmount before a deficiency judgment may be obtained. See also Kalin, Deficiency Judgments and 
California Law; and California Association of Realtors and Bank of America v. Graves, 51 Cal. App. 4th 
607, 59 Cal. Rptr. 2nd 288 (1996). For example under some circumstances, “to obtain a deficiency 
judgment, a lender must apply to the court for a deficiency judgment within three months of the judicial 
foreclosure sale.” Kalin at 3. “No deficiency judgment is allowed following a trustee’s sale.” Id. at 4. 
However, “a borrower who takes out a construction loan for improvements or repairs, but not to finance a

mortgage was $398,588, and his second mortgage was $67,181. Applicant said in his 
OPM PSI that he did not have sufficient financial resources to keep his home out of 
foreclosure, and he said he made some partial payments. Yet, his credit report shows 
on January 2009, he owed a balance on his first mortgage of $398,588 with $45,572 
past due, and he owed $67,181 on his second mortgage with $15,841 past due as of 
October 2010. It would have been particularly valuable in an assessment of his financial 
responsibility and good faith to know how much he paid the mortgage companies while 
he continued to occupy the residence. He did not provide any documentation from his 
bank or the creditors showing any payments on the two mortgages or correspondence 
to or from his creditors showing he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted 
to work with them to resolve the mortgages.  
 
In sum, Applicant did not provide any documentation, such as checking account 
statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or 
made any payments to the following six SOR creditors: (1) communications account ¶ 
1.b ($210); (2) second mortgage account ¶ 1.d ($67,181); (3) first mortgage account ¶ 
1.e ($398,588); (4) bank account ¶ 1.j ($3,882); (5) collection account ¶ 1.k ($213); and 
(6) school debt ¶ 1.l ($1,340). There is no financial documentation relating to these six 
SOR creditors as follows: financial counseling; maintenance of contact with creditors;7 
correspondence to or from these creditors; credible debt disputes in light of his 
acceptance of responsibility in his SOR response; attempts to negotiate payment plans; 
or other evidence of progress or resolution of these six SOR debts, totaling $398,588. 
There is insufficient evidence that his financial problems are being resolved, are under 
control, and will not occur in the future.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                                                                                                                            
personal residence, is subject to a deficiency judgment.” Id. at 5 (citation omitted), see also id. (discussing 
availability of deficiency as remedy for junior lien holders).  In California Association of Realtors and Bank 
of America v. Graves, the court described several scenarios where junior lien holders lost or retained their 
legal right to obtain a deficiency judgment.   
 
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant’s 
finances were adversely affected when he became unemployed after retiring from active 
duty, his spouse’s income was reduced, and property values decreased in his state. 
These are all financial conditions largely beyond his control. He is credited with 
mitigating the six SOR medical debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.f to 1.h, and 1.m as well as one 
telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.i. He has a reasonable budget and an ample 
monthly remainder of $1,761. He admitted responsibility for 11 of his SOR debts. He 
has been employed by the same defense contractor since October 2011, and for the 
last two years he had stable employment. There is no evidence of criminal conduct or 
abuse of alcohol or drugs in more than 20 years. He honorably served for 20 years in 
the Marine Corps. He contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. 
There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security.   
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He fell behind on 
his mortgages in 2009 or 2010, and several other debts became delinquent more than a 
year ago. His PFS showed a remainder of $1,761, and he did not prove that he made 
any payments to the following six SOR creditors after obtaining his current employment: 
¶ 1.b ($210); ¶ 1.d ($67,181); ¶ 1.e ($398,588); ¶ 1.j ($3,882); ¶ 1.k ($213); and ¶ 1.l 
($1,340). As a minimum, he could have resolved the three smallest debts. He could 
have made greater progress resolving and documenting resolution of his delinquent 
SOR debts. He failed to mitigate six SOR debts, totaling $471,414. He did not provide 
documentary proof that he attempted to settle these six delinquent debts despite 
claiming efforts to resolve them. His failure to establish his financial responsibility shows 
lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 19. More 
documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f to 1.i:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j to 1.l:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
