GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 6, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
February 11, 2013.2 On May 15, 2013, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and

modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 
1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 24, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated June 
6, 2013,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on August 14, 2013, and he 
was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on August 26, 2013, but, as of October 16, 2013, he had not 
submitted a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 17, 
2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but 1 (¶ 1.x.) of the 28 factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since July 
2011, has been serving as a facilities specialist.4 Since August 2002, he has also been 
self-employed in building maintenance and janitorial services.5 He previously worked for 
another employer as a supervisor of operations.6 Applicant took online courses from a 
university over a 10-year period, and earned an associate’s degree in June 2010.7 He 
has never served in the U.S. military.8 Applicant was married in June 1999, and has two 
daughters, born in 1998 and 2004.9 Applicant has never been granted a security 
clearance.10

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties, 
although there are significant indications that those problems may have started as early 
as 2002, for Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2003.11 After he filed 
his petition, Applicant changed his mind and decided to cancel the action and resolve 
his credit card accounts, totaling approximately $6,000 to $10,000, by himself. The 
bankruptcy action was dismissed in September 2003, and Applicant contends he paid 
off his credit cards.12 He offered no documentation to support his contention that the 
accounts were resolved at that time. In addition to that Chapter 13 filing and dismissal, 
the SOR identified 27 purportedly continuing delinquencies, including medical accounts, 
mortgages, other unspecified accounts, and judgments.  
 
There are eight medical accounts, totaling $9,617 (from $162 to $2,300), that 
were placed for collection with the same collection agency in April 2010.13 There are 11 
other medical accounts, totaling $5,324 (from $260 to $1,084), that were placed for 
collection with another collection agency between 2009 and 2011.14 Applicant contends 
he spoke to representatives from both collection agencies in order to establish payment 
arrangements, but they refused his offer to pay them $150 per month. They required a 
large percentage as a down payment with upwards of $350 per company per month.15 
Applicant offered no documentation to support his contention that he had made offers of 
repayment or that the collection agencies had required large monthly payments. He 
stated that he was unaware that he could send the collection agencies small monthly 
payments as an indication of his good faith to attempt to resolve his delinquent 
accounts.16 Those 19 delinquent medical accounts remain unresolved. 
 
There are three judgments filed against Applicant. One, in the amount of $1,704, 
was obtained in April 2007 for unsatisfied medical bills accumulated between 2002 and 
2007.17 The latest court documents as of October 2011 reflect the balance as $2,165.18 
Applicant contends the judgment actually covers a number of the same medical 
accounts that were referred to separately in the SOR,19 but he offered no specifics or

documentation to support those contentions. There is no evidence that he made any 
effort to address the judgment. Another judgment, in the amount of $1,529, was 
obtained in May 2008 for an unpaid credit card.20 Although Applicant contended he 
made repayment arrangements to pay the collection attorneys $50 per month, and 
purportedly did so until July 2011, when he stopped because he was considering 
bankruptcy, he offered no documentation to support his contentions that there was a 
repayment agreement or that monthly payments were, in fact, made. The latest court 
documents as of October 2011 reflect the balance as $3,931.21 There is a third 
judgment, in the amount of $7,572, that was obtained in April 2011 for various 
unsatisfied medical bills.22 Applicant contends the judgment actually covers a number of 
the same medical accounts that were referred to separately in the SOR,23 but he offered 
no specifics or documentation to support those contentions. There is no evidence that 
he made any effort to address the judgment. Those three judgments remain unresolved. 
 
There is a second mortgage that Applicant took out on his residence in 2005 with 
a high credit of $43,448 and a balance of $41,461, that was 180 days past due $2,794, 
and charged off in August 2011.24 He originally claimed the creditor told him he was 
nine months delinquent on his payments, and that partial payments were unacceptable 
until the entire sum could be paid.25 Applicant subsequently added that, while he was 
attempting to resolve the account, he was passed around from representative to 
representative by the creditor, and that the account was transferred to a third-party. No-
one with either the creditor or the third-party had contacted him as of June 2013.26 
Applicant offered no documentation to support his contentions that he had made offers 
of repayment or that the creditor of third-party had rejected his payment offers. This 
account remains unresolved. 
 
There is a first mortgage that Applicant took out on his residence in 2005 with a 
high credit of $177,051 and a balance of $177,702, for which foreclosure was initiated.27 
Applicant acknowledged that the house went into foreclosure on two occasions, but 
claims the first foreclosure, in January 2010, was intentional in order to qualify for 
refinancing because he was unable to pay the balloon interest rate. He claimed he 
refinanced the mortgage loan, and within 90 days brought it current.28 The house went 
into foreclosure again in June 2011 when he was unable to come up with three months’

of payments, but contends he was able to eventually obtain the necessary funds to 
remove the residence from foreclosure.29 The principal balance was, as of January 
2013, $173,035.67. The total amount due in February 2013, including monthly principal, 
interest, escrow, late charges, and various fees, was $6,404.92.30 On December 17, 
2012, Applicant made a payment of $1,400, including principal, interest, escrow, and a 
suspense charge of $154.10.31 Applicant contends he is paying an additional $100 per 
month to reduce his past due balance.32 Applicant offered no documentation, in the form 
of receipts or cancelled checks, to support his claim that he is continuing to pay down 
his past due balance on a monthly basis. Likewise, there is no evidence that he has 
actually reduced the overall outstanding balance since January 2013. Nevertheless, this 
account appears to be in the process of being resolved. 
 
There is a time-share loan in the amount of $10,439 that was opened in 2007.33 
As of July 2008, the account was past due $608.34 Shortly after he purchased the time-
share package, erroneously claimed to have been in 2000 to 2002, Applicant decided 
he wanted to withdraw from the agreement, and assumed it would be purchased from 
him without any loss.35 Applicant paid no further attention to the loan and concluded it 
had been resolved.36 He has made no effort to resolve the account since he claims he 
spoke with the time-share company. Applicant offered no documentation to support his 
claim that he had agreed to sell back the time-share loan at no loss. This account 
remains unresolved. 
 
There is a bank credit card with a high credit of $1,215 that was charged off in 
2007 and sold to an unidentified debt purchaser.37 Applicant’s October 2012 credit 
report reflects a zero balance.38 Applicant initially claimed he closed the account and 
paid it off.39 He subsequently modified his explanation and claimed that to “the best of 
[Applicant’s] knowledge [Applicant] had made payment arrangements with this company 
and paid this debt off.” He added that he had attempted to contact the creditor but that

the telephone number he had been directed to had been disconnected.40 Applicant 
offered no documentation, in the form of correspondence, receipts, or cancelled checks, 
to support his claim that he made any effort to resolve the account. Nevertheless, in the 
absence of any evidence contrary to Applicant’s contention, and taking into 
consideration that there is currently a zero balance on the account, and Applicant 
denied the allegation, I conclude the account has been resolved. 
 
Applicant failed to pay his corporate and personal federal income taxes for an 
unspecified period of “previous tax years” in the approximate amount of $14,000.41 He 
claimed his failure to pay the balance was “due to an overflow of business taxes at the 
end of the year.”42 Applicant contends he entered into a repayment plan with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and in October 2011, was paying the IRS $500 per 
month under the plan. He also estimated that, as of October 2011, he had paid the IRS 
an estimated $3,500.43 Applicant acknowledged that, at some unspecified time, he fell 
behind on his payments, and was attempting to re-establish payment arrangements.44 
Applicant offered no documentation, in the form of correspondence, a repayment plan, 
receipts, or cancelled checks, to support his claim that he was actually enrolled in a 
repayment plan or that he had made any of the required payments. This account has 
not been resolved. 
 
In February 2013, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
family net monthly income of $3,917.89. He claimed $1,540 in monthly expenses, and 
$2,236.37 in debt, mortgage, car loan, and student loan payments, leaving $141.52 
available for discretionary spending or savings. He also indicated zero in bank 
savings.45  
 
Applicant attributed his financial situation to a business downturn due to the 
recession, and the fact that he did not have medical insurance for his family.46 He 
claimed he prioritized his accounts to pay his mortgage and keep food on the table. He 
continued to work on his college degree and generated student loans. He also 
contended that in 2009 he attempted to consolidate his debts with an unidentified 
company, but that after about three or four months, he discovered the unidentified 
company was a “scam,” so he stopped working with them.47 Applicant also claims he

recently engaged the services of an attorney to assist him in filing for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13.  
 
As part of the interrogatories addressed to Applicant by the DOD CAF, he was 
requested to furnish documentation in the form of statements, vouchers from creditors, 
copies of repayment agreements, copies of cancelled checks or bank statements, and 
statements from mortgage holders.48 Applicant offered no such documentation of any 
type to confirm his brief debt consolidation engagement, or repayment plans, or even 
something from his attorney to support his recent decision to file for bankruptcy. 
Applicant has never received financial counseling.49 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”50 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”51   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”52 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.53  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”54 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”55 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial difficulties arose as early as 2002 when 
accounts started to become delinquent. As a result, he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13, but eventually dismissed the action and purportedly resolved his delinquent 
credit card accounts. Financial problems persisted, however, and he found himself 
generating additional delinquencies that he was unable to pay. Accounts were placed 
for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. Foreclosures also arose. There are 27 
delinquent accounts identified in the SOR, and it appears that only one such account 
has been resolved, with one being in the process of being resolved. Now, to address 
the remaining delinquent accounts, Applicant intends to again file for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.56

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d), do not apply, and AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. 
The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
since 2002 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” In light of his continuing inability to resolve his delinquent accounts, 
including those that were placed for collection, charged off, or filed as judgments, 
Applicant’s financial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the short term, and they are 
likely to continue. He has never received financial counseling. He also contended that in 
2009 he attempted to consolidate his debts with an unidentified company, but that after 
about three or four months, he stopped working with them because it was a scam. 
While Applicant contends he made some good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent 
debts, he has ignored the request of the DOD CAF that he furnish documentation to 
support his contentions that he has made those efforts. Applicant’s current $141.52 in 
monthly discretionary income available to make payments is negligible and insufficient 
to make even the smallest such effort. There is little, if any, evidence to support a 
conclusion that good-faith efforts by Applicant have been made. Instead, the evidence 
consists of numerous delinquent accounts, one withdrawn Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, 
and a stated intention ten years later to refile under Chapter 13. Applicant’s focus 
seemed to be on his college degree, not generating income. Moreover, considering the 
lengthy period of the effective inaction by Applicant, it appears that he is simply waiting 
for the statute of limitations on those debts to run their course.  
 
Applicant attributed his financial situation to a business downturn due to the 
recession that was largely beyond his control and the fact that he did not have medical 
insurance for his family. The national economy was strong in 2002, and the national 
economic situation did not start to deteriorate until about 2007, years after Applicant’s 
finances first became delinquent. Accordingly, Applicant failed to mitigate his financial 
situation, and under the circumstances, his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.57   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.58       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: He has 
indicated a desire to repay his delinquent debts. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Ever since 2002, Applicant has been experiencing financial difficulties that have 
resulted in accounts being placed for collection, charged off, or filed as judgments. 
Although some of those delinquent accounts were for balances as little as $162, 
Applicant failed to take any meaningful action to resolve them. Instead, he started the 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy process in 2002, but quickly abandoned it. He purportedly spoke 
with creditors about resolving some accounts, but has no documentation to support his 
contentions. He tried debt consolidation, but then abandoned it. He supposedly was 
enrolled in a debt repayment plan with the IRS, but abandoned it as well. Now, he plans 
to refile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant could have made some reasonable timely 
efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, but there is little evidence that he has done 
so. Applicant has demonstrated the absence of a meaningful track record in addressing 
his delinquent accounts. Applicant’s actions indicate a lack of judgment, which raises 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
