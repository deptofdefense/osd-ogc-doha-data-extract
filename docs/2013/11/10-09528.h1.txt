FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on January 5, 2011. In an 
undated document, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 1, 2013; answered it on May 7, 2013; and 
requested a decision based on the administrative record without a hearing. Department 
Counsel requested a hearing and was ready to proceed on July 22, 2013. (Hearing 
Exhibit (HX) I.) The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2013. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 21, 2013, 
 
2 
 
scheduling the hearing for September 20, 2013. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without 
objection. I kept the record open until October 4, 2013, to enable Applicant to submit 
additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX B through E, which were 
admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX B through E 
are attached to the record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 3, 
2013. My decision was delayed by the furlough of administrative judges from October 1 
to October 11, 2013, due to the failure of Congress to timely appropriate funds for fiscal 
year 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f 
and 1.h-1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.k. He stated that the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e was paid in full. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing 
are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old senior consulting field engineer employed by a defense 
contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 1981 to October 1988 
and was honorably discharged. (GX 2 at 14.) He has worked for his current employer 
since April 2010. He was previously employed by another defense contractor from July 
2003 to April 2010. He was laid off because of lack of work for two or three weeks 
before beginning his current job. (Tr. 37.) When he began his current job, his pay was 
about $320 per month less than what he earned in his previous job. (Tr. 105.)  
 
Applicant received a security clearance in September 1997. It was revoked in 
September 2009 when he did not timely respond to financial interrogatories from DOD. 
(GX 2 at 8; Tr. 10, 35.) 
 
 Applicant married in August 1992 and divorced in November 2005. He married 
his current spouse in September 2009. He has no children from either marriage and no 
financial obligations to his former spouse. His current spouse has two children, ages 23 
and 26, who are self-supporting. (Tr. 33-34.) 
 
 Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1997 and 
received a discharge in April 1998. (GX 6.) He filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
in August 2000, which was dismissed in October 2000 for failure to commence 
payments. (GX 7.) He filed another petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 
2000, which was dismissed in December 2003 for failure to make payments. (GX 8.) His 
three bankruptcy petitions are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. 
 
 Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBRs) dated January 19, 2011 and April 3, 
2013 reflect the following delinquent debts, which are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.k. (GX 3 
and 4.) 
 
 
3 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d, home mortgage account past due for $27,335, with total balance 
of $27,335. Applicant bought his home in September 2009. When he was laid off in 
April 2010, he was about one month behind on his payments. He remained one month 
behind until he missed another payment in January 2011 due to overspending on 
Christmas gifts. (Tr. 40.) He did not contact the lender, believing that he would be 
allowed to catch up on his payments. His missed the April and May payments after he 
was laid off. At this point, the lender would not accept any more payments until all the 
past-due payments were paid. (Tr. 40-42.) In January 2013, Applicant executed a trial 
period agreement as a condition for a loan modification. (GX 2 at 15-19.) In May 2013, 
his loan modification was approved. In September 2013, a foreclosure action on this 
property was dismissed without prejudice. (AX A.) Applicant’s payments on the modified 
loan are current. The delinquent mortgage loan is reflected on the January 2011 CBR, 
but not on the April 2013 CBR. (GX 3 at e; GX 4.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e, credit card account collected by garnishment for $6,989. 
Applicant had a company credit card, and he was obligated to make the payments and 
then file for reimbursement from his employer. He fell behind on his payments. (Tr. 60-
63.) In April 2012, Applicant authorized his employer to withhold $318 per pay period 
until the debt was paid. (GX 2 at 21.) He believed he would have been fired if he had 
not authorized the withholding. (Tr. 69.) The debt has been paid in full. (AX B.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f, charge account in collection for $2,722. Applicant testified that this 
debt was incurred when he purchased a riding lawn mower. He made three payments 
and then fell behind because he was laid off. The account was referred for collection in 
June 2010. (GX 3 at 8.) He did not contact the creditor when he fell behind, nor did he 
contact the collection agency. (Tr. 71-73.) The debt is reflected on the April 2013 CBR 
(GX 4 at 1.) It is unresolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g, charge account for a music service in collection for $157. 
Applicant opened an account with this creditor to purchase digital video disks (DVDs). 
The account required him to purchase six DVDs. After purchasing the required six 
DVDs, Applicant started sending the DVDs back to the creditor, but they continued 
sending him more DVDs, a total of five more. He did not contact the creditor, believing 
that returning the DVDs was sufficient notification that he did not desire to make any 
more purchases. After the account was referred for collection, he made no attempt to 
contact the collection agency. (Tr. 72-75.) The January 2011 CBR reflected that the 
account was referred for collection in February 2009, and that the debt was disputed. 
(GX 3 at 8.) The debt is not reflected on the April 2013 CBR. (GX 4.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h, utility bill in collection for $173. Applicant testified that this bill was 
incurred in his name by his ex-wife after they divorced. He testified that he contacted 
the original creditor by telephone after receiving interrogatories from DOHA, and told the 
creditor that he had never lived at the address where the service was received. He 
thought that the issue was resolved. (Tr. 76-78.) The debt is reflected on the January 
2011 CBR, but not on the April 2013 CBR. (GX 3 at 8; GX 4.)  
 
 
4 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i, college tuition bill in collection for $703. Applicant incurred this 
debt for on-line college courses, and it was referred for collection in September 2006. 
He testified that he thought the debt was consolidated with other student loans. He 
contacted the original creditor by telephone, and the creditor promised to respond, but 
did not. (Tr. 79-80.) The debt is reflected on the January 2011 CBR, but not on the April 
2013 CBR. (GX 3 at 9; GX 4.) Applicant’s April 2013 CBR reflects several student loans 
that are current.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j, charge account in collection for $2,598. In his response to the 
SOR, Applicant stated that this debt is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.f. The January 2011 CBR 
reflects that both debts have the same account number (512107199062) but that the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.f has four additional digits. I conclude that this debt duplicates the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k, student loan in collection for $259. The January 2011 CBR reflects 
that this debt was referred for collection in July 2010. The debt does not appear on the 
April 2013 CBR. (GX 3 at 11; GX 4.) In his response to DOHA financial interrogatories, 
his answer to the SOR, and at the hearing, Applicant stated that he had no knowledge 
of this debt. He testified that could not find a telephone number for the original creditor, 
but he did not use any online search engines to identify either the original creditor or the 
collection agency. (Tr. 80-81.)  
 
 When Applicant purchased his home in September 2009, he withdrew funds from 
his retirement account to make the down payment. He incurred a federal tax penalty for 
early withdrawal from the account. Although he usually received a federal tax refund, he 
owed about $6,700, which he was unable to pay when he filed his return for tax year 
2010. He did not contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding his inability to 
pay the taxes due. Instead, he waited for the IRS to contact him. When the IRS 
contacted him, he agreed to pay the entire amount. He withdrew $6,874 from his 
retirement account and paid the taxes due in May 2012. (GX 2 at 30; Tr. 96-98, 102-03.) 
The tax debt is not alleged in the SOR.1 
 
 In April 2013, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) reflecting 
net monthly income of about $3,812, expenses of $1,250, debt payments of $2,422, and 
a net remainder of $139. (GX 2 at 13.) Since April 2013, his net monthly income has 
increased to about $4,000. His expenses and debt payments have remained about the 
same. (Tr. 83-85.) He does not have a written budget. (Tr. 89.) He has not received any 
financial counseling except for the counseling required by the bankruptcy court in 2003. 
(Tr. 90.) 
                                                          
1 Conduct not alleged in the SOR may not be an independent basis for denying a clearance. However, it 
may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative 
guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to 
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person 
analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered 
Applicant’s tax debt for these limited purposes.

Applicant testified that his financial problems were the result of being reckless, 
and “when [he] would get money in [his] pocket, it started going out the door.” He 
testified that his financial recklessness stopped about two years ago. (Tr. 31.) 
 
 Applicant’s annual performance appraisals for the past two years rated him as 
exceeding expectations. For both years, he was rated one step below the top rating (far 
exceeds expectations) on a four-step scale. (AX C.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
 
6 
 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in December 1997 and discharged 
in April 1998 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in August 2000 and dismissed 
in October 2000 for failure to commence payments (SOR ¶ 1.b); and a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy filed in November 2000 and dismissed in December 2003 for failure to make 
payments (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $40,937 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.k). 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The record does not reflect the circumstances leading up to Applicant’s three 
bankruptcy petitions, except for his general comments at the hearing about financial 
 
7 
 
recklessness. The dismissal of his two Chapter 13 petitions reflected the same 
inattention to financial matters that caused him to lose his clearance in September 
2009.  
 
 The evidence shows that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j is the same debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.f. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). 
Accordingly, I have resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j for Applicant. 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, credit report, and record of bankruptcy filings establish 
the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  
 
 
8 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s debts are recent, numerous, and were 
not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant’s short-term loss of employment 
around April 2010 and his reduced pay when he began his current employment were 
circumstances beyond his control. However, he initially did not act responsibly. He 
overspent on Christmas gifts even though he was past due on a mortgage payment. He 
did not contact the lender when he fell further behind. On the other hand, he finally 
realized the seriousness of his financial situation and successfully obtained a mortgage 
modification. He made all the payments on time during the trial period and was current 
on his payments as of the date of the hearing.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant obtained financial counseling as a 
prerequisite for his Chapter 13 petition in 2003, but he has not sought or obtained 
counseling to address his current financial situation. Except for the home mortgage loan 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d and the delinquent credit card account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, his 
financial situation is not yet under control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the delinquent mortgage payments alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.d, but not for the other debts alleged in the SOR. Although the credit card debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has been paid, the involuntary manner in which it was paid does 
not constitute “good faith” within the meaning of this mitigating condition. Good faith 
means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence 
to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 
12, 1999). Payment by involuntary garnishment, “is not the same as, or similar to, a 
good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.” ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Applicant 
produced no evidence of payments on the other debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the music service debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, the 
utility bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h, and the tuition bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i. Although 
Applicant did not dispute the music service debt in writing, his January 2011 CBR 
reflected that it was disputed, and Applicant’s testimony established a reasonable basis 
for disputing the debt. The April 2013 CBR does not reflect the debt, indicating that the 
dispute was resolved in his favor. Deletion of the debt was not required by the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, since it was referred for collection less than seven years before 
the April 2013 CBR, and the record reflects no other basis for deleting it.2 Applicant 
testified that he telephonically disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i, and 
they also were not reflected on the April 2013 CBR, even though they were referred for 
collection less than seven years before the date of the CBR.  
 
                                                          
2 Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a credit report may not list accounts placed for collection or 
charged off that antedate the credit report by more than seven years. 10 U.S.C. § 1681c. 
 
9 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy for seven years and has been 
employed almost continuously by defense contractors for ten years. He held a 
clearance for 12 years. He has made a good start toward righting his financial ship by 
successfully modifying his home mortgage, but he has not yet established a track 
record of financial responsibility. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial 
considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.g-1.j:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:     Against Applicant 
   
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
