MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant began to struggle financially following the dissolution of his first marriage. 
He hired a debt servicing company that settled at most a couple of his debts. After paying 
off a delinquent account in April 2013, Applicant still owes about $23,060 in long-overdue 
debt. In late August 2013, he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case under which he proposes 
to repay his debt at $252 per month for five years. Applicant appears to have sufficient 
income to afford the payment, and he can be counted on to follow through with this plan to 
resolve his debts. Clearance granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On April 5, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
 
 
 2 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on May 8, 2013, and he requested a 
hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On 
August 22, 2013, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. On August 30, 2013, I issued a notice scheduling a hearing for September 27, 
2013. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) and six 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on October 7, 2013. 
 
The record was held open for three weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit 
additional documents. On October 17, 2013, Applicant submitted by electronic mail three 
exhibits, which were marked as AEs G-I. On October 18, 2013, I gave the Government a 
deadline of October 28, 2013, for comment. On October 18, 2013, Department Counsel 
indicated that the Government did not have any objections, pending assurance from 
Applicant that his submissions were complete. On confirmation from Applicant that no 
information was missing, I accepted the documents into evidence as AEs G-I. The record 
closed on October 18, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of April 5, 2013, Applicant owed 
delinquent debt totaling $30,819 on seven accounts (SOR 1.a-1.g). In his response to the 
SOR allegations, Applicant admitted that six of the alleged debts were delinquent. The 
$2,215 debt alleged in SOR 1.e had been paid before the SOR was issued.
1
 After 
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings 
of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old high school graduate who retired from the U.S. military in 
April 2006 at the rank of technical sergeant. He has held a DOD security clearance for 27 
years for his duties in the military and then for a succession of defense contractor 
employers. He is currently employed as an integration engineer for a defense contractor. 
(GEs 1-3; Tr. 20-21.) 
 
While serving overseas, Applicant married his first wife in March 1988. They had 
three children, who are now ages 22, 18, and 12.
2
 (GE 1; AE B; Tr. 42-43.) Following his 
                                                 
1 
Applicant now denies any knowledge about the judgment or the account that it represents. (AE I.) 
 
2 
Applicant indicated on his e-QIP (GE 1.) that the younger of his two daughters was born in 2005. Other 
evidence indicates a likely birthdate for her of February 1995. She was born overseas on a U.S. military base, 
and Applicant was stationed in the United States from June 1998 until his retirement. (GEs 1, 3.)  Applicant 
 
 3 
retirement from the military, Applicant began working as a senior systems network engineer 
for a defense contractor. He stayed on when the contract was acquired by another defense 
contractor (company X) in May 2008. (GE 1.) 
 
In May 2008, Applicant and his first wife separated due to an “irretrievable 
breakdown” in their marriage. Applicant moved out of the marital home. Shortly thereafter, 
he and his current spouse began cohabiting. (GE 1; AE B.) In early June 2009, Applicant’s 
first wife filed for divorce. (AE B.) Applicant was ordered to pay child support of $630 per 
week, and his wages were automatically garnished for child support pending the final 
decree of divorce. (GEs 1, 3; AE B; Tr. 46.) Applicant married his second wife in July 2011. 
(Tr. 54.) 
 
Due to his child support payments, Applicant knew that he would not be able to keep 
up with his payments on the credit card debt incurred during his marriage to his first wife 
and also with the costs of maintaining a separate household. (GE 2.) On June 22, 2009, 
Applicant hired a debt resolution company to negotiate with his consumer creditors at a 
monthly fee of $100 starting on July 1, 2009. (GEs 2, 3; AE D; Tr. 57.) He did not want to 
file for bankruptcy, and the debt management plan would allow him to resolve his debt over 
time. On the advice of the debt resolution company, Applicant stopped paying on the 
accounts covered in their agreement.
3
 (GE 3; Tr. 23-24.) Around July 1, 2009, he advised 
his creditors of his agreement with the debt resolution company, to whom he had given a 
limited power of attorney. (GE 2; AE F.) Over the next two years, the debt resolution firm 
settled a couple of his delinquent accounts, including the debt in SOR 1.g. (Tr. 58.) 
 
In November 2009, Applicant relocated for a new job in a distant state with a lower 
cost of living. His future spouse found work with a grocery store in their new locale at an 
hourly wage between $10 and $12. (Tr. 55-56.) Applicant relied on consumer credit to 
cover about $5,000 in relocation costs. (GE 1; Tr. 22, 50.) 
 
On April 13, 2010, Applicant and his first wife entered into a binding separation 
agreement, declaring their rights and responsibilities upon their divorce. Applicant’s first 
wife assumed responsibility for all expenses related to the marital home from September 
2009, with the exception of three utility accounts in Applicant’s name. Applicant was held 
liable for all credit card debt in his name incurred during the marriage. (AE B; Tr. 43.) 
Applicant and his ex-wife agreed to share legal custody of their two unemancipated 
children. She had sole physical custody of the children. Applicant had visitation rights, and 
he bore the costs of their children’s airfare to visit him. Applicant also agreed to pay $825 
per week in alimony to his ex-wife in lieu of child support because of the tax advantages to 
him.
4
 (AE G; Tr. 47.) 
                                                                                                                                                             
also testified that she just started college. (Tr. 42.) 
  
3 
The listing of debts and balances covered by the plan was not submitted in evidence, but Applicant stopped 
paying on the debts identified in SOR 1.b, 1.c., and 1.d around that time. See GEs 4, 5; AE I. 
 
4 
Effective March 1, 2012, alimony laws were reformed in the state. Under Section 208:53 of the state’s 
general laws, except for reimbursement alimony or circumstances warranting deviation for other forms of 
alimony, the amount of alimony should generally not exceed the recipient’s need or 30 to 35 percent of the 
 
 4 
 
In conjunction with the periodic reinvestigation of his Top Secret clearance, 
Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on January 11, 2011. (Tr. 23.) He responded 
affirmatively to financial record inquiry 26.h, concerning any account or credit card 
suspended, charged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed within the last seven 
years. Five creditors had been notified that the debt settlement company was managing his 
accounts in an attempt to settle his outstanding balances at a reasonable rate. One of his 
five debts had been settled, and he expected to settle the rest within the next year. 
Applicant also answered “Yes” to 26.k, regarding any wage garnishment within the last 
seven years. He explained that his wages had been garnished under a temporary child 
support order pending the final decree of divorce. (GE 1.)  
 
As of January 19, 2011, the credit bureaus were reporting four past-due collection 
accounts on Applicant’s record with respective balances of $8,675  (SOR 1.b), $6,156 
(SOR 1.c),  $4,126 (SOR 1.d), and $1,831 (SOR 1.f). Another account (SOR 1.g) had been 
placed for collection in September 2009 in the amount of $4,400, but it reportedly was 
rated as current with a $3,803 balance as of June 2010. Applicant was making payments 
as agreed on other consumer credit accounts with balances of $3,857 (SOR 1.e), $703, 
$7,932, and $18,766. (GE 5.) 
 
 On February 16, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), partially about accounts that had been 
referred for collection. Applicant indicated that he had suspended payments on the 
accounts covered by his debt management plan, including those listed in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 
and 1.f. He indicated that he would have to check his records for information about the 
account in SOR 1.g. During a follow-up telephone contact with the investigator on February 
18, 2011, Applicant indicated that the account in SOR 1.g was settled and closed on 
September 25, 2009 [sic].
5
 (GE 3.) 
 
Around July 2011, the debt resolution firm stopped debiting Applicant’s monthly fee 
from his bank account without any explanation or warning. (Tr. 57.) Applicant tried to 
contact the company without success. After some research, he determined that numerous 
complaints had been lodged, and three states had filed lawsuits, against the firm for 
deceptive practices. (AE D.) 
 
Expecting to be included in a round of layoffs by his then employer, Applicant 
accepted a job with another defense contractor in the summer of 2011. Applicant incurred 
$5,000 in long-distance moving expenses, which he spread among his credit card 
accounts. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant’s spouse found work in a supermarket in their new area, 
again initially part-time at an hourly wage between $10 and $12. (Tr. 55-56.) Around 
                                                                                                                                                             
difference between the parties’ gross income established at the time of the order for alimony. 
 
5 
Available credit reports indicate that the account was closed and placed for collection in September 2009. 
The debt was likely settled in August 2011, which is the date of reported last activity on the account. (GE 4; AE 
I.) 
 
 5 
August 2012, Applicant was laid off. He fell behind in his alimony payments during a brief 
period of unemployment. (Tr. 25.) Sometime in the fall of 2012, he accepted an offer to 
return to company X as an integration engineer. Applicant funded the $2,000 in out-of-
pocket costs for his and his spouse’s long-distance relocation by selling most of their 
possessions. With only those belongings that they could fit in their compact car, Applicant 
and his spouse drove across the country for his new job. (Tr. 25-26, 50.) 
 
At the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant executed a Personal Financial Statement 
in mid-March 2013. Applicant reported monthly take-home pay of $6,114 for himself and 
$1,200 for his spouse. With his military retirement, their household income was $8,685 
after deductions.
6
  Applicant indicated a net remainder of zero each month after paying 
$3,300 in alimony, their household expenses, and $2,240 in debt payments.
7
 Applicant was 
paying his divorce attorney $150 a month. Applicant added that he had been repaying the 
debt in SOR 1.e at $460 per month, and that his goal was to resolve his debts through 
payments rather than bankruptcy. (GE 2.) 
 
As of June 11, 2013, Equifax Information Services was reporting some delinquent 
balances on Applicant’s credit record, as set forth in the following table:

Applicant reportedly earns $7,888 in gross earnings from his work per month. More than half of his take-
home salary is being paid in alimony. 
 
7 
He indicated he was making monthly payments of $150 and $300 on two accounts, which were shown in the 
available credit reports (GE 4; AE I) to be delinquent with no activity since January 2013. 
 
8 
In forwarding a copy of his June 12, 2013 credit report for inclusion in the record after his hearing, Applicant 
indicated that while he had previously admitted the debt in SOR 1.a, he confused this account with that in SOR 
1.d. He denied knowing anything about the judgment account. The judgment is on his credit report, but there is 
no listing of the debt in SOR 1.d as a separate line item. See AE I. The judgment debt in SOR 1.a and the debt 
in SOR 1.d could be the same debt, but the evidence is unclear. The creditor was included in his bankruptcy. 
See AE H.

Applicant provided only the certificate of notice showing the creditors included in his Chapter 13 filing. He did 
not provide any evidence as to the debt amounts or account numbers.

Applicant’s January 2011 credit report showed two installment accounts with the same lender:  an account 
opened in August 2004 with a $3,000 credit limit and a zero balance as of August 2005 and an account 
opened in August 2005 with no activity since then (SOR 1.f). That account reportedly had a $1,831 collection 
balance and was being managed by a debt counseling service. See GE 5. Applicant submits that the debt has

collection; managed by debt 
resolution firm as of Jan. 
2011. (GE 5.)  
$3,803 collection debt (SOR 
1.g) 
Revolving charge account 
opened Nov. 2007; $4,400 
for collection Sep. 2009 (GE 
5.); high balance $4,605. 
(AE I.) 
Settled on payment of 
$2,994 Aug. 2011. (AE I.)  
 
 As of June 2013, Applicant had nine consumer credit card accounts on his credit 
record with outstanding balances totaling $58,928. Only two of the accounts, with 
respective balances of $18,606 (closed by creditor) and $8,302 (open account), were rated 
as current. (AE I.) Applicant denied that he had any active credit card accounts as of late 
September 2013. (Tr. 44.) 
 
 After struggling financially for the past year, and with his security clearance eligibility 
under scrutiny for unresolved debts, Applicant decided that his only viable option was 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 26.) On August 30, 2013, he and his spouse filed a joint Chapter 13 
petition.
11
 (AEs A, I.) Under his plan, which was not confirmed as of his hearing, Applicant 
proposed to make monthly payments of $252 for five years starting in September 2013. 
(Tr. 38-39.) He planned to mail his first payment on September 27, 2013. (Tr. 45-46.) He 
provided no proof after his hearing that it had been mailed. Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney 
has indicated to him that his creditors are unlikely to object to his bankruptcy plan at the 
meeting of creditors scheduled for October 4, 2013. (AEs A, H; Tr. 44-45.) 
 
 Applicant’s spouse takes home about $400 a week from her job at a supermarket. 
(Tr. 44, 54-55.) With the $252 bankruptcy payment, Applicant and his spouse have around 
$300 in monthly net household income. (Tr. 39-40.) Because Applicant is paying above the 
new statutory limit for alimony, he believed he had a “good chance” of the court reducing 
his alimony obligation. (Tr. 40-42.) After his hearing, Applicant determined that under the 
state’s child support guidelines effective August 1, 2013, he would likely be required to pay 
more than the $825 per month currently going to alimony. The younger of his two 
daughters is a college freshman, and his son lives with his ex-wife. (Tr. 42.) For now, he 
has decided to continue with his present alimony arrangement. (AE G.) 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
been paid because of the zero balance of the August 2004 account. See AE I. In February 2011, Applicant told 
the OPM investigator that he opened an account with the creditor on a date unknown in an initial amount of 
$15,000. The account had a balance of $1,774.49. The account number he provided in February 2011 does 
not match that of the account opened in August 2004, so the debt in SOR 1.f could be a separate account. He 
indicated in February 2011 that settlement of the account was being negotiated by the debt management firm. 
See GE 3. Recent credit reports (GE 4; AE I.) do not substantiate an outstanding delinquency to the creditor 
as of the date the SOR was issued. Even if SOR 1.d is a separate debt from the judgment in SOR 1.a, the 
creditor identified in SOR 1.d has been notified of Applicant’s bankruptcy filing. (AE H.) 
 
11 
Applicant filed as doing business in information technology control. (AEs A, H.) Among the creditors notified 
of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing were the Internal Revenue Service and two state tax authorities. (AE H.) It 
is unclear what Applicant owes in federal and state taxes. Applicant also listed as a creditor his divorce 
attorney, to whom he was paying $150 per month. (Tr. 41-42.) 
 
 8 
Applicant has been a good employee for company X. In quality of work, productivity, 
and problem solving, Applicant has exceeded his employer’s expectations. (AE C.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant began to struggle financially after he and his ex-wife separated in May 
2008. He had to maintain a separate residence for himself, although he had some financial 
assistance from his cohabitant girlfriend, whom he later married. When Applicant’s ex-wife 
filed for divorce in June 2009, the state began garnishing $630 per week from his wages 
for child support. On the advice of a debt servicing firm retained to negotiate settlements 
with his creditors, Applicant stopped paying on some of his credit card obligations around 
July 2009. Two years later, the debt resolution company had settled a couple of his debts, 
including the debt in SOR 1.g. Because of alimony payments at $825 per week, Applicant 
made no payments toward some long-overdue accounts until late 2012, when he began 
repaying the debt in SOR 1.e. As of early April 2013, he owed around $23,060 in 
delinquent balances, assuming settlement of the debt in SOR 1.f that is no longer on his 
credit record. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations,” are established, requiring additional inquiry 
about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Applicant has the burden of mitigating the financial concerns. AG ¶ 20(a), “the 
behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply. The credit card accounts in 
the SOR became delinquent in 2009 or later. Furthermore, Applicant has fallen behind 
recently in some credit card payments. As reflected in his June 2013 credit report, 
Applicant was behind on $1,911 on four accounts with an aggregate balance of $12,973. 
While these past-due debts cannot provide a basis for disqualification, they indicate the 
ongoing nature of Applicant’s financial problems.

  Applicant’s financial problems largely stem from his divorce. He incurred the costs 
of maintaining a separate residence, repayment liability for the outstanding marital credit

The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-
person analysis under Directive Section 6.3. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07218 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012).

card debt, and a child support obligation of $630 per week. Upon his separation agreement 
in April 2010, Applicant agreed to an alimony obligation of $825 per week in lieu of child 
support. Divorce is a mitigating circumstance under AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that 
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” When faced 
with these financial burdens, Applicant acted responsibly in several aspects. Within a 
month of his ex-wife filing for divorce, Applicant retained the services of a debt resolution 
firm to negotiate settlements with his creditors. The evidence shows that he had been 
making payments on his debts until he was advised to stop by the debt resolution firm. 
Applicant paid the debt resolution firm $2,400 before the company, which settled two debts 
on his behalf, breached its agreement with him without warning in July 2011. With the 
obligation to work with his creditors then squarely on him, and facing a likely job layoff, 
Applicant took a new job, which meant another long-distance relocation that summer. This 
decision was reasonable, despite the additional consumer credit burden of another $5,000 
in moving costs. Applicant’s financial situation was again compromised a year later, when 
he was unexpectedly laid off. He minimized the impact on his credit with his move for his 
current position by selling most of his personal possessions and then driving across the 
country. All the while, he continued to pay his alimony on time, but for a brief period of 
unemployment after the layoff. 
 
Applicant’s effort to settle his debts through the debt resolution firm is indicative of 
his good faith under AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” So too are his payments from late 2012 to April 2013 
to satisfy the debt in SOR 1.e. His recent failure to keep up with his payments on some 
credit card accounts makes it more difficult to apply AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received 
or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” As of May 2013, Applicant and his spouse 
were ninety days past due on a joint retail credit card account opened in May 2011, which 
has been closed by the credit grantor. Furthermore, although Applicant was making 
payments on two credit card accounts opened during his first marriage, which had 
balances of $18,606 and $8,302, his high ratio of debt to credit raises some concern about 
his handling of his financial matters. At least before the bankruptcy, Applicant did not have 
any financial counseling beyond arranging the debt management plan. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
is partially applicable. Applicant’s June 2013 credit report (AE I) confirms that the debt in 
SOR 1.g was settled well before the SOR was issued. The evidence to substantiate the 
settlement of SOR 1.f falls short of that required under AG ¶ 20(e), although the debt no 
longer appears on his credit record as an outstanding balance. 
 
Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in late August 2013 to 
alleviate the financial pressure of their large credit card debt. Applicant asserts that he can 
afford the proposed $252 monthly payment under the bankruptcy. As of March 2013, he 
 
 11 
reportedly had a zero household balance after expenses and debt payments totaling 
$2,240 each month. The evidence shows that he was behind in his payments on two credit 
card accounts at that time. Yet, with the satisfaction of the debt in SOR 1.e in April 2013, 
Applicant freed up about $460 per month. It does appear that his household income can 
support the bankruptcy payments, and all of his creditors have been included in the 
bankruptcy. As of his security clearance hearing, Applicant expected his bankruptcy plan to 
be confirmed, although it is possible that some of his creditors will object to the plan. 
Applicant’s finances are likely to remain tight as long as he is required to maintain alimony 
payments that take half of his net income each month. Even so, Applicant has shown 
through his two years of payments to the debt resolution firm, his satisfaction of the debt in 
SOR 1.e, and his recent bankruptcy filing, that he can be counted on to continue to take 
steps to address his debts, whether or not his present bankruptcy plan is confirmed. The 
financial considerations concerns are sufficiently mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
  
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
13
  
 
Applicant became financially overextended because of his divorce. Wanting to 
support his children, he agreed to an alimony obligation that takes half of his net income. In 
making the whole-person assessment required under the Directive, the DOHA Appeal 
Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution 
of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 
07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant tried to settle his debts through a debt 
servicing company that breached its agreement with him after he made two years of 
payments. He has now taken steps to ensure through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing that 
his creditors receive at least a percentage of what he owes them. Applicant has shown that 
he takes his security clearance obligations seriously by reporting his financial problems on 
his e-QIP. Based on the facts and circumstances in evidence, I conclude it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for him. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
                                                 
13 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.
