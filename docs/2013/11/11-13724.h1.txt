HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
In May 2003, Applicant’s non-priority, unsecured debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Eighteen delinquent or charged-off debts, totaling 
$21,638, were subsequently listed on his statement of reasons (SOR). He made some 
progress; however, he failed to mitigate five delinquent SOR debts, totaling $18,223. He 
failed to make sufficient progress resolving his financial problems. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 26, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 4) On May 8, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On June 17, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated July 16, 2013, was provided to him on August 8, 2013. He was afforded an 
opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.1 Applicant responded to the FORM and provided 24 pages of documents, 
which were admitted into evidence without objection (pg. 1-24). The case was assigned 
to me on October 31, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c to 1.p, 1.r, and 1.s. He 
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.q. He also provided an explanation for his 
delinquent debts, and provided mitigating information. He did not provide any 
corroborating documentation from creditors. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 38 years old, and he has been employed as a project manager since 
July 2011.3 In 2001, he married, and he has two children, who were born in 2004 and 
2007. (Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) at 3) 
He graduated from high school in 1992, and he received a bachelor’s degree in 2001. 
He has never served in the military. There is no evidence of criminal arrests or 
convictions. There is no evidence of use of illegal drugs or alcohol abuse. 
 
In 1999, Applicant and his daughter were in a car accident.4 Applicant’s daughter 
was killed, and Applicant was seriously injured. Applicant was unable to work for a 
substantial period after the accident, and his debts became delinquent. In May 2003, 
Applicant’s unsecured, non-priority debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code.    
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated July 16, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 8, 
2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s July 26, 2011 SF 86 is the basis for the facts in this 
paragraph. (Item 5) 
 
4Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s SOR response is the source for the facts in this paragraph 
and the next six paragraphs. (Item 4 at 4-6)

Applicant’s SOR ¶ 1.b telecommunications debt is for $1,557. He denied 
responsibility for this debt, as he has service with the same company. He called the 
telecommunications company. A company representative said the entry was erroneous, 
and the company will correct their records. Applicant’s FORM response includes a 
printout from the internet indicating a credit reporting company acknowledged receipt of 
a copy of Applicant’s dispute of this debt. (pg. 16)   
 
Applicant mitigated the 11 medical debts in SOR ¶ 1.c ($64), ¶ 1.d ($337), ¶ 1.e 
($100), ¶ 1.f ($155), ¶ 1.g ($106), ¶ 1.h ($100), ¶ 1.k ($32), ¶ 1.m ($103), 1.n ($393), 1.o 
($165), and 1.p ($108). He paid the debts in SOR ¶ 1.c ($64) (pg. 8-9), ¶ 1.k ($32), (pg. 
10) He initiated a payment plan to address five medical debts: 1.d ($337); 1.e ($100); 1.f 
($155); 1.g ($106), and 1.h ($100). (pg. 11-13) He stated he intends to pay $100 
monthly starting on October 25, 2013, to address these five debts. (pg. 11-13) On 
October 22, 2013, he provided $100 in post-dated checks to the creditor for the five 
debts. (pg. 18-19) On October 23, 2013, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.m ($103), ¶ 1.n ($393), 
¶ 1.o ($165), and 1.p ($108) agreed to request removal of the four debts from 
Applicant’s credit reports. (pg. 14, 20-24) 
 
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($4,800) is from a credit card Applicant “used to 
survive and keep [his] family out of foreclosure” during a period of unemployment. In his 
October 4, 2011, OPM PSI Applicant said he would contact the creditor and make 
arrangements to pay the debt. (OPM PSI at 6) In his SOR response, he said he made 
payment arrangements to repay this debt. In his response to the FORM, the creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.i ($4,800) wrote Applicant and acknowledged receipt of a copy of his dispute of 
the debt. (pg. 15)  
 
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($8,169) resulted from a corporate credit card. 
Applicant’s OPM PSI indicates he “is currently making payments to eliminate this debt.” 
(OPM PSI at 4) In his SOR response, Applicant said he is supposed to provide 
“expenditure receipts to release this debt. The receipts are currently being compiled.” 
Applicant’s FORM response did not clarify the status of this debt.  
 
Applicant’s debts in SOR ¶ 1.l ($224), ¶ 1.r ($2,030), and ¶ 1.s ($3,000) are owed 
to department stores. In Applicant’s October 4, 2011, OPM PSI Applicant said that he 
agreed to pay half of the amount to settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r, and he is in the process 
of completing this transaction. (OPM PSI at 5) He also said he contacted the creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.s and is in the process of negotiating a settlement of this debt. (OPM PSI at 5) 
On June 17, 2013, Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l would be paid in 30 days. 
Applicant said the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 1.s were generated during periods of 
unemployment, and “[p]ayment arrangements have been made” to repay these two 
debts. Applicant’s FORM response did not clarify the status of these three debts. 
 
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($195) is owed to a municipality for a traffic 
violation. Applicant said his spouse was driving the car registered in his name, and the 
debt was transferred to her. In response to the FORM, Applicant provided a letter from 
Applicant’s spouse indicating that she took responsibility for the traffic violation fine of 
$195 in SOR ¶ 1.q. (pg. 17)

On October 13, 2011, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant about his 
finances and discussed numerous delinquent debts with him. (Item 6) Applicant was 
unemployed from September 2005 to December 2005, January 2009 to May 2009, and 
April to July 2011. (OPM PSI at 1, 2) Some of his debts also became delinquent due to 
medical problems, and insufficient income. He took his family on a seven-day cruise 
outside the United States in February 2008. (OPM PSI at 3) There is no evidence of 
financial counseling. 
 
In Applicant’s October 4, 2011 OPM PSI, he admitted responsibility for the SOR 
debts. (Item 6) In his March 12, 2013, response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said 
he was disputing his responsibility for the account balances on his credit report because 
Applicant’s father and Applicant have the same name (Applicant is a “Junior” and his 
father is a “Senior”). (Item 6) He provided letters to the credit reporting companies 
disputing his responsibility for 19 debts, including most of the SOR debts. (Item 6) He 
did not dispute his responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j for $8,169.     
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) shows his monthly gross salary is 
$6,731; his monthly net salary is $5,020; and his monthly net remainder after 
subtracting expenses is $735.5 The only debt payment shown on his PFS is a $1,435 
monthly payment to his mortgage account with a balance of $136,000. (Item 6 at 8)            
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
                                            
5Applicant’s personal financial statement is the source for the facts in this paragraph. (Item 6 at 8)

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM PSI, responses to DOHA interrogatories, SOR response, and 
FORM response. His non-priority, unsecured debts were discharged in 2003 under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; however, Applicant subsequently generated 18 
delinquent or charged-off SOR debts, totaling $21,638. The Government established 
the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about 
the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;6 and 
                                            
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all SOR debts; however, he provided some 
mitigating information. Applicant’s unemployment, underemployment, low income, and 
medical problems are all financial conditions largely beyond his control; however, he did 
not act responsibly under the circumstances. He did not describe any unemployment or 
changes in his income after July 2011, when he received his current employment. He 
paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($64) and 1.k ($32). He paid $100 to initiate a payment 
plan to address five medical debts: 1.d ($337); 1.e ($100); 1.f ($155); 1.g ($106), and 
1.h ($100).  
 
Applicant successfully disputed the debts in SOR ¶ 1.m ($103), ¶ 1.n ($393), ¶ 
1.o ($165), and 1.p ($108). I have also credited Applicant with mitigating the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.q ($195) because his spouse has taken financial responsibility for paying this 
traffic ticket, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,557) because he has a current account with 
the same telecommunications company.    
 
Applicant’s PFS shows a positive monthly remainder of $735; however, he only 
established $196 in payments to his SOR creditors over the previous two years. He did 
not establish that over the previous two years he could not have settled and paid more 
of his SOR debts.  
 
Applicant did not provide any documentation, such as a checking account 
statement, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or

made any payments to the five creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($4,800), 1.j ($8,169), 1.l ($224), 
1.r ($2,030) and 1.s ($3,000). There is no documentation showing financial counseling, 
correspondence to or from these five creditors, credible debt disputes in light of his 
previous acceptance of responsibility for these five debts, attempts to negotiate 
payment plans, or other evidence of progress resolving these five SOR debts. He did 
not provide documentation proving that he maintained contact with these five SOR 
creditors.7 There is insufficient evidence that his financial problems are being resolved 
and are under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant’s 
finances were adversely affected when he became unemployed, he was under 
employed, and he had medical problems. These were circumstances beyond his 
control. He paid two debts, successfully disputed four debts, reasonably disputed two 
debts, and initiated payment plans on five debts. He has been employed by the same 
defense contractor since July 2011, and for the last two years he had stable 
employment. There is no evidence of criminal conduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. He 
contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of 
disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security.   
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He received a 
fresh start in May 2003 when his non-priority, unsecured debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; however, he subsequently generated additional 
delinquent debt. His PFS indicated he has a remainder of $735, and his FORM 
response described total payments to SOR creditors of only $196. He could have made 
greater progress resolving and documenting resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. He 
failed to mitigate five delinquent SOR debts, totaling $18,223. He did not provide 
documentary proof that he made any payments to these five SOR creditors or that he 
attempted to settle these five delinquent debts despite claiming efforts to resolve these 
debts in his 2011 OPM PSI. His failure to establish his financial responsibility shows 
lack of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 15. More 
documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.h:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.k:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m to 1.q:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.r and 1.s:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
