GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 13, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On May 6, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to 
the interrogatories on July 3, 2013.2 On July 24, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 1, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
August 14, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on August 23, 
2013. The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on September 11, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on 
September 25, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1 through GE 3) and six 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A through AE F) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 10, 
2013. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took 
advantage of that opportunity. He submitted five additional documents, which were 
marked as exhibits (AEs G through AE K) and admitted into evidence without objection. 
The record closed on October 11, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.h.). He denied the 
remaining allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since 
September 2011, has served as a student analyst.3 He was on active duty with the U.S. 
Army from August 1990 until August 2011, when he retired as a sergeant first class.4 He 
was granted a secret security clearance in 1991.5 Applicant attended college briefly in 
2008, but did not obtain a degree.6 He was married in April 1993, separated in May 
2011, and is currently pending a divorce.7 Applicant and wife have two daughters.8

Military Service 
 
Applicant was deployed to Haiti in 1994, to Iraq two times in 2001, and again to 
Iraq in 2005.9 During his military career, Applicant was awarded the Meritorious Service 
Medal (two awards), the Army Commendation Medal (two awards), the Army 
Achievement Medal (five awards), the valorous unit award, the Army Good Conduct 
Medal (six awards), the National Defense Service Medal (with bronze star), the Global 
War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the 
Iraq Campaign Medal (with campaign star), the non-commissioned officer professional 
development ribbon (three awards), the senior aircraft crewman badge, the parachutist 
badge, the air assault badge, and the driver and mechanic badge.10  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2005. Because 
of his periodic deployments and his frequent temporary duty assignments with a special 
operations deployment unit, which he estimated to be an average of 200 days per year, 
Applicant’s wife normally handled the family finances.11 Although his income went into 
an account for her to make the required monthly payments, unbeknownst to him, 
Applicant’s wife spent the money on herself for “stuff that she wants” before paying for 
what the family needs.12 He had no idea of the extent or nature of his debts until he and 
his wife separated in May 2011.13 He first learned that he had a financial problem when 
his wife called him at his office to inform him that the residence they owned at his last 
military assignment had been foreclosed upon by the bank.14 She had waited until the 
very last moment to spring the news on him, and by that time, it was too late for him to 
take any action to save the residence.15 Documentation from various creditors was 
simply “shuffled over into the corner” and never furnished to him by his wife.16 Only 
lately, because of his security clearance review and as part of their continuing divorce 
discussions, has she been furnishing him correspondence from creditors.17

To complicate matters, Applicant discovered his wife was having a continuing 
affair with her boss.18 Applicant cancelled the power of attorney he had given his wife,19 
but he spent a significant period of time attempting to reconcile with his wife and 
keeping his family together before realizing his efforts were fruitless.20 He then turned 
his focus on his creditors in an effort to identify them and resolve his delinquent 
accounts. Applicant eventually identified several credit cards that his wife had opened in 
his name. He had never carried any credit cards other than his bank debit card and his 
Government-issued credit card.21 Applicant takes full responsibility for not supervising 
his wife’s actions and his finances.22 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, in July 2013, Applicant provided a 
personal financial statement reflecting a monthly net salary of $5,021.28, monthly 
household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $2,700.03, and monthly debt 
repayments of $1,040, leaving a monthly remainder of $1,660.03 available for 
discretionary savings or expenditures.23 He also reflected $1,300 in a savings 
account.24  
The SOR identified five delinquent debts totaling $24,663 that had been charged 
off, and three delinquent debts totaling $2,430 that had been placed for collection, as 
generally reflected by a 2011 credit report.25 Some accounts listed in the credit report 
have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other 
accounts are referenced repeatedly in the credit report, in some instances duplicating 
other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor 
name. Several accounts are listed with only partial account numbers. Those debts listed 
in the SOR, and their respective current status, according to the credit report, evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) There is a home equity line of credit with a high credit of $24,450 
that was 120 days past due in the amount of $22,637, and charged off in December 
2011.26 The creditor issued Applicant’s wife a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, in 
December 2009.27 I conclude the debt has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.b.) There is an overpayment in the amount of $2,812 with the Defense 
Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) that was placed for collection.28 Applicant 
contended that he filed his travel voucher for retirement travel in June 2011, reflecting a 
travel advance of $2,775.50.29 It appears that DFAS never received the travel voucher 
and simply sought reimbursement of the advance payment. Nevertheless, DFAS 
increased the balance, first to $2,797 in July 2012, and eventually to $2,812.30 The 
DFAS correspondence was sent to his wife’s address, but not forwarded to Applicant. 
After Applicant learned of the issue, he eventually went to the facility soldier center and 
refiled his travel voucher.31 In addition, $500 has been garnished from his salary.32 
Applicant’s travel was authorized by military orders as part of his retirement out-
processing,33 and once the travel voucher is properly processed, the matter should be 
resolved. I conclude the debt is in the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is a credit card account with a high credit of $398 that was 90 
days past due in the amount of $161.34 The unpaid balance was increased to $506 and 
charged off.35 The account was acquired by a debt purchaser. Applicant contacted the 
debt purchaser and they agreed to both a settlement and a repayment plan. Effective 
September 16, 2013, Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $50.69 until 
$304.14 is paid, and at that point the account will be considered settled and resolved.36 I 
conclude the debt is in the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $500 and high 
credit of $686 that was 150 days past due in the amount of $646.37 The unpaid balance 
was charged off in December 2011.38 Applicant contacted the creditor and they agreed 
to both a settlement and a repayment plan. Effective September 30, 2013, Applicant 
agreed to make monthly payments of $50.69 until $586.81 is paid, and at that point the

(SOR ¶ 1.e.) There is a credit card account with credit limit of $1,500 that was 
placed for collection in 2009, and charged off in the amount of $685.40 The account was 
acquired by a debt purchaser, and the creditor reported a zero balance.41 Applicant was 
not the principal name on the account, but merely an authorized user.42 Applicant 
contacted the debt purchaser and they agreed to a repayment plan. Applicant agreed to 
make monthly payments of $50 until the charged-off amount is paid, and at that point 
the account will be considered resolved.43 I conclude the debt is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.) There is a credit card account with a high credit of $498 that was 
placed for collection in 2008, charged off, and sold to a debt purchaser.44 The creditor 
reported a zero balance.45 The debt purchaser, claiming to be a factoring company,46 
reported the high credit to be $758.47 Applicant contacted the debt purchaser and paid 
off the account.48 The account currently reflects that it has been paid and there is a zero 
balance.49 I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.) There is a medical account with an unspecified medical provider 
with a high credit and balance of $300 that was placed for collection in 2007.50 When 
interviewed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in January 
2012, Applicant indicated he had no idea who the provider was or who received the 
service.51 Neither the 2011 credit report nor the SOR identified the provider. Applicant 
has medical insurance coverage from Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Tricare, and he

inquired about any balances with his children’s primary care physician, but was unable 
to find any unpaid balances.52 The account is no longer listed in Applicant’s 2013 credit 
report. Applicant has taken reasonable efforts to identify the creditor to resolve the 
account, but has been unable to do so in light of the paucity of information about the 
account in the credit reports and the SOR. Accordingly, although there is no evidence 
that Applicant has paid the creditor, I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.) There is an account with an insurance company with a high credit of 
$214 and past-due balance of $130 that was placed for collection in 2011, and 
transferred or sold to a collection agent.53 Although the 2011 credit report listed the 
account as an individual account in Applicant’s name,54 the name on the account was 
that of Applicant’s wife.55 Applicant contacted the collection agent and paid off the 
account, and paid an extra convenience fee for doing so.56 There is now a zero 
balance.57 I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
There is no evidence that Applicant has any other delinquent accounts. Applicant 
has not received any financial counseling.58 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 One of Applicant’s colleagues, a retired first sergeant, has known Applicant since 
they were both on active duty over ten years ago. They have been contractors working 
on the same programs for different employers for up to four years, and he is now 
Applicant’s team leader. Applicant, a person with integrity, has a reputation for being 
trustworthy, honest, and reliable.59 Applicant’s project manager considers Applicant to 
be loyal and honest.60  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”61 As Commander in Chief,

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”62   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”63 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.64  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation

as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”65 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”66 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant had five delinquent debts totaling $24,663 that had been 
charged off, and three delinquent debts totaling $2,430 that had been placed for 
collection, as generally reflected by a 2011 credit report. He lost one residence to a 
foreclosure, and then discovered the remaining delinquencies. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG

¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.67  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his 
means. Instead, his financial problems were largely beyond his control. Because of his 
periodic deployments and his frequent temporary duty assignments, Applicant’s wife 
normally handled the family finances. His income went into an account for her to make 
the required monthly payments, but unbeknownst to him, Applicant’s wife spent the 
money on herself before paying the family bills. He had no idea of the extent or nature 
of his debts, or about his deteriorated financial situation, until he and his wife separated 
in May 2011. The documentation from the various creditors was never furnished to him 
by his wife. When Applicant discovered his wife was having a continuing affair with her 
boss, he cancelled the power of attorney he had given his wife, and took over 
responsibility for his finances. The situation occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur now that he and his wife are separated and about to divorce. 
However, rather than immediately addressing his delinquent accounts, he spent 
a significant period of time attempting to reconcile with his wife and keeping his family 
together before realizing his efforts were fruitless. He eventually turned his focus on his 
creditors in an effort to identify them and resolve his delinquent accounts. He identified 
several credit cards that his wife had opened in his name, but noted that he had never 
carried any credit cards other than his bank debit card and his Government-issued 
credit card. Applicant took full responsibility for not supervising his wife’s actions and his 
finances. Applicant acted responsibly by contacting the creditors and collection agents 
he could identify, by paying off two accounts, entering repayment agreements with three 
creditors, and resubmitting his travel voucher (after having had $500 garnished on the 
account). Although Applicant attempted to locate the one remaining account for which

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

neither the credit reporting agency nor the SOR had any identity or contact information, 
it remains unpaid. It is no longer on Applicant’s 2013 credit report. Applicant has no 
other delinquent debts. Despite not having received any financial counseling, with a 
monthly remainder of $1,660.03 available for discretionary savings or expenditures, 
there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.68 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.69       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant paid 
little, if any, attention to the family finances, and his wife’s handling of his finances 
permitted accounts to become delinquent and one residence to be lost to foreclosure. 
As a result, accounts were placed for collection or charged off. In addition, Applicant 
initially focused primarily on his deteriorating marriage rather than on his deteriorating 
finances.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending on 
his part, and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control.  Financial delinquencies were hidden from him by his wife 
until it was, in some cases, simply too late to rectify. Nevertheless, once he learned the

true extent of his financial situation, Applicant did not ignore his creditors. Instead, he 
embraced his financial responsibilities and attempted to contact the identified creditors 
and collection agents. The entire situation occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:70 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant efforts to resolve his accounts. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
