GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 5, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On September 19, 2012, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
November 2, 2012.2 On January 23, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn statement, notarized 
February 25, 2013,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have 
his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on June 3, 
2013, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the 
FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant received the FORM on June 11, 2013. He submitted a timely response to the 
FORM, to which there was no objection. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 
2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j., and 
1.l. through 1.n.) of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the 
SOR.4 Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since July 
2007, has been serving as a technical call technician.5 He previously worked for other 
employers as a call center agent, customer support agent, contract worker, inventory 
specialist, computer help desk agent, and county security officer.6 He was unemployed 
from October 2006 until March 2007; March 2003 until October 2006; and June 2002 
until December 2002.7 He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electronics 
engineering technology in October 2006.8 He served on active duty with the U.S. Air

 Although Applicant admitted the allegation in ¶ 1.f., he stated that the account was paid in October 2010. 
He also admitted the allegation in ¶ 1.b., but stated he was making payments on the account. He stated that the 
allegations in ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e. referred to the same account, and the allegations in ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.n. referred to one 
account. With the exception of his statements regarding the allegations in ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.f., he failed to offer any 
documentation to support his contentions.

Force in an enlisted capacity from 1973 until 1983, and received an honorable 
discharge.9 He has held a top secret security clearance for an unspecified period of 
time.10 Applicant was married in December 1993.11 He was previously married to 
another woman on an unspecified date, and divorced in October 1993.12 He has two 
sons (born in 1980 and 1981), two daughters (born in 1978 and 1983), a stepson (born 
in 1976) and a stepdaughter (born in 1978).13 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
December 2001, when he claimed he became unemployed.14 Accounts became 
delinquent. Applicant has been gainfully employed since March 2007. While he was 
able to address some of his delinquent accounts since that time, there were some 
remaining accounts that still awaited his attention. The financial situation deteriorated 
once again in 2009, when his daughter separated from her boyfriend and needed a 
place to live. She and her three children moved in with Applicant and they became his 
dependents.15 The daughter was to contribute $500 per month for rent and contribute 
50 percent of the bills and food, but at some point, she stopped making the payments, 
and the children’s needs became more of his responsibility. The additional financial 
responsibilities diverted money from his budget, and he periodically failed to pay his 
monthly mortgage and other bills.16 Although the situation was to be a temporary one, it 
took longer than anticipated for his daughter to find a job, and they remained in his 
household at least until late 2011.17 During the same period, Applicant’s employer 
reduced the available overtime, and Applicant’s income was also decreased.18 Once 
again, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or were charged off. 
One account went to judgment.

Although Applicant contended he was making an effort to re-arrange monthly 
payments to pay “the most important first,” and then his other debts,19 he submitted no 
specific plan or documentation to support his contentions. He hoped to eliminate his 
debts to become debt-free.20 Applicant never contacted any debt consolidation service 
and never received any financial counseling.21  
 
In June 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
family net monthly income of $3,118.58. He claimed $3,772.86 in monthly expenses, 
with $496.41 in debt payments, leaving minus $1,151.14. Potential overtime earnings 
and infrequent payments from his daughter were not included in the net monthly income 
calculations. If they were so included, Applicant would still have insufficient funds for 
discretionary spending or savings.22 In November 2012, Applicant submitted another 
personal financial statement reflecting a family net monthly income of $4,003.70. He 
claimed $2,447.84 in monthly expenses, with $977.00 in debt payments, leaving 
$578.86 available for discretionary spending or savings.23 
 
The SOR identified 15 purportedly continuing delinquencies. For the purposes of 
discussion, the accounts can be separated into: a) those which Applicant contended he 
either has paid off or is in the process of paying; and b) those which Applicant has made 
little if any effort to contact the creditor or dispute the account, and has offered no 
substantiated proof of any payment arrangements or payments.  
 
In the first category, or those which Applicant contended he either has paid off or 
is in the process of paying, are the following: an account for the financing of an 
automobile with a high credit of $10,872 that was $3,191 past due and placed for 
collection and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.b.).24 Although the SOR alleged the past-due 
amount was $11,193, an amount reflected in the September 2012 credit report,25 that 
amount is erroneous, as is the listing in the January 2013 credit report, wherein it is 
reflected as $11,053.26 Applicant has been making monthly $35 payments for an 
unspecified period, and as of February 2013, the unpaid balance has been decreased 
to $9,874.67.27 The account is in the process of being resolved.

There is a water utility account with an unpaid balance of $219 that was placed 
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.f.).28 Although the SOR alleged the account was still unpaid in 
January 2013, as reflected in the May 2011 credit report,29 the information and the 
allegation were erroneous, as the account, in the amount of $218.90, was paid in 
October 2010.30 The account has been resolved. 
 
In the second category, or those which Applicant has made little if any effort to 
contact the creditor or dispute the account, and has offered no substantiated proof of 
any payment arrangements or payments, are the following: a medical account in the 
amount of $2,242 (SOR ¶ 1.a.);31 a medical account in the amount of $125 (SOR ¶ 
1.c.);32 a student loan in the amount of $18,279 (SOR ¶ 1.d.);33 a student loan in the 
amount of $17,622 (SOR ¶ 1.e.);34 an insurance account in the amount of $89, alleged 
two times in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.n.);35 a medical account in the amount of 
$514 (SOR ¶ 1.h.);36 a medical account in the amount of $38 (SOR ¶ 1.i.);37 an 
unspecified type of account in the amount of $1,495 (SOR ¶ 1.j.);38 an account with a 
fuel company in the amount of $49 (SOR ¶ 1.k.);39 an unspecified type of account in the 
amount of $113 (SOR ¶ 1.l.);40 an account with a pizza shop in the amount of $48 (SOR 
¶ 1.m.);41 and a telephone account in the amount of $285 (SOR ¶ 1.o.).42 Seven of the 
above accounts have been in a delinquent status since before 2007, and none of the 
above accounts has been resolved. 
 
 With respect to his non-SOR accounts, in June 2012, Applicant entered into a 
loan modification agreement with his mortgage lender to extend or rearrange the time 
and manner of payment of the note and to extend and carry forward the lien on the

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”45 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”46   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”49 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had financial problems since December 2001, and 
those problems were exacerbated in 2009. A substantial number of his accounts 
became delinquent, and they were placed for collection or were charged off. Although 
he has been gainfully employed since July 2007, the vast majority of his delinquent 
accounts remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.51  
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d), do not apply, and AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
since 2001 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” In light of his continuing inability or failure to resolve his pre-2007 delinquent 
accounts, as well as his more recent delinquent accounts; the absence of significant 
efforts to contact his creditors; the lack of a clear repayment plan; the absence of 
repayment arrangements with his creditors; the paucity of payments to creditors, even 
those with balances under $500; and his failure to obtain financial counseling, 
Applicant’s financial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the short term, and they are 
likely to continue. Applicant’s actions with respect to his delinquent accounts do not 
constitute a “good-faith” effort on his part. Applicant contended his financial problems 
                                                          
51
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

were caused by his loss of employment, the loss of overtime, or the presence of his 
daughter and grandchildren living in his residence for a lengthy period. Applicant’s 
period of unemployment was clearly beyond his control, but it ended in March 2007, and 
Applicant has been gainfully employed since then. While the loss of overtime might be 
considered beyond his control, it is not an entitlement to be expected, but rather a 
possibility that might occur. While Applicant accepted financial responsibility for his 
daughter and grandchildren, he never explained whether or not they were receiving 
child support or public assistance. Furthermore, Applicant never explained what 
additional expenses he incurred because of their presence in his residence. Applicant’s 
daughter and children departed in mid-2011, but he never explained why he was unable 
to address his debts after their departure. After so much time where little positive efforts 
were taken, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate his financial situation. Under the 
circumstances, his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.52   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.53       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: He has been 
gainfully employed since March 2007; he is a veteran; and he is a caring father and 
grandfather.

The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s actions reflect a continuing inability or failure to resolve his pre-2007 
delinquent accounts, as well as his more recent delinquent accounts. There is an 
absence of “good-faith” efforts to contact most of his creditors, set up repayment plans, 
or to make payments to creditors, even for those with balances under $500. Applicant 
has not demonstrated a meaningful track record in addressing his delinquent accounts. 
Applicant’s actions indicate a lack of judgment, which raises questions about his 
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
