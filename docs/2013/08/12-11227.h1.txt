HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine delinquent debts owed to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), totaling $382,585. Applicant admitted to seven IRS 
liens. The IRS is seeking $263,456 for tax years 1999-2005, 2008, and 2011 from him. 
He did not make sufficient progress resolving his financial problems. He intentionally 
failed to disclose his tax debts on his July 29, 2011 Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). Financial considerations and personal 
conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 29, 2011, Applicant submitted an SF 86 (Item 5). On January 3, 2013, 
the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued an  
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated 
by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On January 3, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 3) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated April 4, 2013, was provided to him on June 4, 2013. He was afforded an 
opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on 
July 25, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.c, 1.e, 1.g-1.i, and 2.a. He denied the remaining allegations in SOR ¶ 1. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old site civil and structural engineer, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since March 2011.3 He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1977. 
He has two children, who were born in 1982 and 1983. There is no evidence of arrests 
or convictions. There is no evidence of use of illegal drugs or alcohol abuse.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The credit reports and SOR allege the following federal tax liens: (1) $34,361 for 
tax years 2000-2002; (2) $26,737 for tax years 2003-2005;4 (3) $101,000 for tax years 
1998 and 1999;5 (4) $101,000;6 (5) $7,521 for tax year 2011; (6) $54,094 for tax year 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated May 28, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated June 4, 
2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Applicant’s July 29, 2011 SF 86 is the basis for the facts in this paragraph. (Item 5) 
 
4 Applicant concedes that the correct amount should be $37,737. (FORM at 4) 
 
5 The 1998 portion was paid off based on Applicant’s agreement with the IRS, in which he agreed 
to pay $2,000 monthly. (FORM at 4)  
  
6 Department Counsel concedes that SOR ¶ 1.d is a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. (FORM 
at 4, 7)

2008;7 (7) $10,363 for tax year 2008; (8) $46,058 for tax year 2008; and (9) $1,451 for 
tax year 2011. Estimates of Applicant’s total federal tax liability range from $263,456, 
based on Applicant’s meeting with the IRS in October 2012 (FORM at 7; SOR response 
at 2), to about $227,000, based on the seven liens listed in the SOR that Applicant 
admitted in his SOR response.  
 
A spreadsheet for October 24, 2012, shows taxes, penalties and interest, totaling 
$263,456 for the following years: 1999 ($79,048); 2000 ($27,098); 2001 ($9,186); 2002 
($10,128); 2003 ($9,910); 2004 ($12,046); 2005 ($32,827); 2008 ($75,241); 2011 
($7,972). (SOR response) 
 
There is no evidence of financial counseling. There is limited evidence of 
progress resolving his SOR debts, consisting primarily of filing his tax returns and 
conducting negotiations with the IRS. 
 
The May 28, 2013 DOHA letter conveying the FORM to Applicant invited him to 
“submit any material you wish the Administrative Judge to consider or make any 
objection you may have as to the information in the file.” Applicant did not provide any 
response to the FORM. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
Applicant answered, “No” in response to 16 questions in Section 26 concerning 
financial issues on his July 29, 2011 SF 86. (Item 5) He did not disclose the delinquent 
taxes owed to the IRS in response to four questions relating to taxes: (1) Section 26.c 
asks in the last seven years, “Have you failed to pay Federal, state, or other taxes, or to 
file a tax return when required by law or ordnance?”; (2) Section 26.m asks in the last 
seven years, “Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?”; (3) Section 26.n 
asks, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?”; and (4) Section 26.p 
asks, “Are you currently delinquent on any Federal debt?”     
 
On October 25, 2011, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Investigator 
completed Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI).8 Initially, Applicant said in April 
2011, when he filled out his SF 86, he was unaware of his tax problems. When he 
signed his SF 86 in July 2011, he did not review it. He did not file his tax return in 2008 
because he believed his income was tax exempt, as he was working overseas. From 
2008 to May 2011, Applicant believed that income earned overseas was tax free. In 
May 2008, Applicant received a letter from the IRS seeking $80,000. In May 2011, 
Applicant learned that the first $85,000 received in overseas income is tax exempt, and 
income above $85,000 is fully taxable. In May or June 2011, Applicant filed his tax 
                                            
7 Applicant concedes that the correct amount is $57,872, and that the liens in SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.i are 
included in this amount. (FORM at 5) 
 
8 The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s October 25, 2011 Office of 
Personnel Management Investigator (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant. (Item 6)

returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010.9 Applicant’s accountant said Applicant owed $40,000 
to $50,000. Applicant filed an appeal with the tax court. In September 2011, Applicant 
agreed to go to arbitration in lieu of tax court. Applicant said he wanted to settle the IRS 
debt and begin a payment plan.  
 
Later during the October 25, 2011 OPM interview, Applicant was confronted with 
the tax liens in the SOR. Applicant admitted that in 2005, he met with an IRS employee 
about not filing his tax returns or filing late from 2002 to 2005. Applicant signed a 
payment plan and made payments until 2006. He said he stopped making payments 
because he could not afford them. Applicant said that his accountant told him that the 
IRS liens expire after six years and he should not mention them to the IRS. He admitted 
that he did not file his federal tax return in 2007; however, he said he did do so because 
he did not make enough income. He also said that he did not disclose his tax liens 
because he thought that they had expired. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
                                            
9 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns as 
required or that he failed to disclose on his SF 86 that he failed to file his federal income tax returns as 
required. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). The allegation that he failed to file his federal tax returns as required would implicate AG 
¶ 19(g), which indicates “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same” is a disqualifying condition. However, AG ¶ 19(g) will not be applied in this 
case because Applicant has not had adequate notice and a full opportunity to collect and present 
evidence of mitigation regarding this allegation. Additionally, there is evidence that he intentionally failed 
to disclose on his SF 86 that he failed to file his federal income tax returns as required. An independent 
basis for denying a security clearance would be his failure to disclose on his SF 86 his failure to file 
federal tax returns as required. These two non-SOR allegations will be considered for the five limited 
purposes annunciated in the above quoted case law, and not for any other purpose.

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent tax debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM PSI, and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR lists nine delinquent 
debts owed to the IRS, totaling $382,585. Applicant admitted seven IRS liens, totaling 
about $227,000. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;10 and 
                                            
10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts. He admitted 
responsibility for the seven SOR federal tax liens, totaling approximately $227,000. As 
of October 24, 2012, the IRS is seeking $263,456 from Applicant for tax years 1999-
2005, 2008, and 2011. He was irresponsible in his manner of handling his federal 
income taxes. After years of having tax problems, culminating in his settlement 
discussions with the IRS in 2005, he failed to file his tax returns from 2008 to 2011 until 
May or June 2011. He was negligent in his research of the overseas exemption. There 
is no evidence of financial counseling. He did not provide documentation proving that he 
maintained contact with the IRS from 2006 to 2011.11 There is insufficient evidence of 
progress resolving his SOR debts, resolution of his financial problems, or control of his 
finances. He did not establish his financial responsibility. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
                                                                                                                                            
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
11“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
AG ¶ 16(a) applies. Applicant deliberately answered “No” in response to 16 
questions in Section 26 concerning financial issues on his July 29, 2011 SF 86. More 
specifically, he did not disclose the delinquent taxes owed to the IRS in response to any 
of following four questions: (1) Section 26.c asks in the last seven years, “Have you 
failed to pay Federal, state, or other taxes . . . ?”; (2) Section 26.m asks in the last 
seven years, “Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?”; (3) Section 26.n 
asks, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?”; and (4) Section 26.p 
asks, “Are you currently delinquent on any Federal debt?” He deliberately failed to 
disclose derogatory financial information about his federal income tax debts. 
Consideration of mitigating conditions is required.  
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant deliberately denied on his July 
29, 2011 SF 86 that he had delinquent tax debts currently owed or owed more than 180 
days in the last seven years. He made these false statements in an attempt to mislead 
the Government about his tax problems. He failed to pay his taxes in the last seven 
years, and he had seven tax liens, totaling about $227,000. No one misled him into 
thinking complete information about his tax debts should not be reported on his SF 86. 
The questions are clear; he is intelligent, a college graduate, and an engineer; and he 
understood that all negative financial information requested was reportable on his SF 
86. His explanation for failing to fully disclose all of his tax debts is not credible. His 
false statement on his July 29, 2011 SF 86 is serious and relatively recent. Personal 
conduct concerns are not mitigated.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. There is 
no evidence of criminal conduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. Applicant is intelligent as 
shown by his educational background and history of employment as an engineer. He 
clearly has the capability of understanding and taking reasonable actions to resolve 
financial consideration concerns. He contributes to his company and the Department of 
Defense. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national 
security.

The evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial at 
this time. Applicant has a long history of financial problems. He failed to mitigate seven 
tax liens, totaling about $220,000. As of October 24, 2012, the IRS is seeking $263,456 
for tax years 1999-2005, 2008, and 2011 from Applicant. He could have made greater 
progress resolving and documenting resolution of his tax problems. His failure to 
establish his financial responsibility shows lack of judgment and raises unmitigated 
questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 15. Applicant intentionally failed to disclose derogatory tax 
information on his July 29, 2011 SF 86. Full disclosure of relevant security-related 
information is crucial to national security. More documented financial progress and 
honest, frank disclosure on security documents is necessary to fully mitigate security 
concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.g to 1.i:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
