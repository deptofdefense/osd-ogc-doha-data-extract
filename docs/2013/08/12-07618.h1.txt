MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant was denied a security clearance in January 2006, partially because of 
financial problems. Despite annual household income over $130,000, Applicant and his 
spouse subsequently defaulted on their student loans. Judgments were issued against them 
for medical debts and for delinquent vehicle taxes. Within the last year, Applicant settled 
some credit card accounts for less than their full balances and satisfied the court judgments. 
While he is making payments toward his student loans and a credit card debt in collection, 
his recent financial irresponsibility precludes a favorable decision at this time. Clearance 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On reconsideration of Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) issued an undated Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and explaining why it was 
unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance 
eligibility for him. DOHA took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
 
 
 2 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on May 23, 2013, and he requested a 
hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On 
July 12, 2013, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant. On 
August 12, 2013, I issued a notice scheduling a hearing for September 4, 2013. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Ten Government exhibits (GEs 1-10) and 
eight Applicant exhibits (AEs A-H) were admitted without objection. A chart, referred to by 
Department Counsel in his closing argument, was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1). 
Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on September 10, 2013.  
 
At Applicant’s request, and without objection from the Government, I held the record 
open for two weeks after the hearing for additional documents from Applicant. On 
September 17, 2013, Applicant submitted four exhibits (AEs I-L), which were forwarded to 
Department Counsel for review and comment by September 25, 2013. The Government 
did not object to their admission, and the documents were admitted into evidence on 
September 19, 2013. The record closed on that date. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant 
owed nine delinquent debts totaling $49,021 (SOR 1.a-1.i), of which $34,250 was student 
loan debt in collection (SOR 1.c). After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I 
make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old senior piping designer. He attended college from 
September 1995 to June 1999, when he left school six credits short of a bachelor’s degree. 
He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since September 2003.  
Applicant married his spouse in October 2004. He and his spouse have two daughters, 
who were born in December 2005 and in June 2009. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 44-45, 49.) 
 
After leaving college, Applicant worked as a substitute teacher in a middle school. 
He was employed as a technical documentation writer for a lithography company from 
about October 2000 to September 2003, when he began his current employment. On 
September 23, 2003, Applicant applied for a Secret clearance. (GE 6.) He disclosed no 
financial issues out of concern for the possible adverse impact on his security clearance 
eligibility. (GE 3.) At the time, he owed $24,735 in student loan debt in collection. A civil 
judgment of $520 had been entered against him in March 1999. Active collection debts of 
$540 (credit card) and $243 (cable services) from 2001 had not been paid. A credit card 
debt of $447 and a telephone services debt of $408 had been charged off. Two other 
delinquent credit card accounts had been sold. (GE 10.)  
 
 3 
On February 4, 2004, Applicant provided a sworn statement to a special agent from 
the Defense Investigative Service. He indicated that he and his fiancée (now spouse) owed 
about $68,000 in debt, of which about $25,000 was his debt. Applicant admitted that he 
had defaulted on his student loans because other expenses took priority. Over the next 
three months, he planned to obtain his credit report and either contact his creditors or 
arrange for debt consolidation. Applicant executed a Personal Financial Statement showing 
that his and his fiancée’s monthly expenses and debt payments (including $200 per month 
toward his then fiancée’s $15,000 in student loan balances) exceeded their monthly 
income by $729 with no provision for payments on his student loans and four other 
delinquent accounts. Applicant acknowledged that to repay his debts, he would have to 
curtail his miscellaneous expenses estimated at $1,300 per month. (GE 7.) 
 
On October 19, 2004, the DOD issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging Guideline F 
concerns because of his student loan default, past-due credit card debt totaling $987, 
telephone and cable delinquencies totaling $651, and his negative monthly household 
balance. Guideline E concerns were alleged because of his failure to disclose any debts on 
his security clearance application. In December 2004, Applicant satisfied the cable 
television debt. Between March 2005 and May 2005, Applicant made $275 monthly 
payments on his student loans. However, because of additional expenses, including a 
mortgage payment for their home purchased in early March 2005 (Tr. 45.), Applicant had 
not satisfied his credit card delinquencies by an August 2005 hearing convened by me 
concerning his security clearance eligibility. On January 30, 2006, I issued a decision 
denying Applicant security clearance eligibility because he had not paid the past-due credit 
card debt and had made only a few payments toward rehabilitating his student loans. He 
had also deliberately concealed his delinquencies when he applied for his security 
clearance. (GE 5.) The decision denying him clearance eligibility was upheld on appeal on 
April 4, 2006. (GE 4.) 
 
Applicant remained on the job as a productive employee working on non-classified 
projects. (AEs A, K, L.) In February 2012, Applicant began an extended work assignment 
off-site. His skills and expertise in the area of piping systems arrangement and design led 
the program supervisor to endorse Applicant as a preferred candidate for a supervisory 
position. (GE 2; AE A.)  
 
Needing a security clearance to progress at work (GE 3; Tr. 66.), Applicant asked 
DOHA to reconsider him for security eligibility on August 20, 2012. He requested an 
opportunity to show that he had resolved “an abundance [of] debts” since 2008 and was 
making a good-faith effort to negotiate a settlement of his remaining accounts. Applicant 
submitted a credit report of April 24, 2012, showing that he and his spouse were making 
timely monthly payments of $633 on a second mortgage loan balance of $64,014, although 
their loan had been 30 days late 11 times between September 2010 and February 2012. 
They reportedly had only one more payment of $265 to make on a three-year vehicle lease 
taken out in April 2009 (SOR 1.g). In April 2011, they financed a new car through a loan of 
$23,946. They had been 30 days late twice in 2011 in making their $506 monthly payment, 
but they had brought their loan current.

 Applicant was an authorized user on two credit 
                                                 
1 
Applicant testified that he has had a lot of repairs on the vehicle, although he provided no estimate of the 
 
 4 
card accounts with a bank, which were settled for less than their full balances in July 2009 
when they had become 90 days and 120 days past due. A credit card account with a home 
improvement retailer, on which he was also an authorized user, was paid for less than its 
full $6,039 balance after it had been charged off. Applicant had two closed accounts with 
past-due balances of $593 (SOR 1.e) and $779 (SOR 1.d). The consolidated balance of 
Applicant’s delinquent student loans was $27,510 and over 180 days past due (SOR 1.c). 
He was supposed to pay $154 per month for six years but had made no payments after 
January 22, 2010. (GE 2.) A medical debt of $100 from April 2010 was in collection. A 
cable television debt of $349 from November 2011 was in collection as of January 2012 
(SOR 1.h). Applicant also owed a collection debt of $500 from 2009 to a rental car 
company (SOR 1.i). (GE 2.) 
 
On October 10, 2012, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant disclosed the denial of his security clearance 
eligibility by DOHA in January 2006, and he listed several delinquencies:  a $100 medical 
debt (SOR 1.b), which he claimed was pending resolution with his insurance company; a 
disputed $593 consumer credit debt in collection (SOR 1.e); a $500 rental car debt (SOR 
1.i); and $1,476 in student loan debt (SOR 1.c), which he reportedly was in the process of 
deferring. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant’s credit report of October 30, 2012, showed that in addition to the 
previously disclosed $100 medical debt, $500 rental car debt, and $593 consumer credit 
debt, he owed a medical judgment of $1,184 filed in March 2012 (SOR 1.a), a $779 
wireless phone debt (SOR 1.d), and a $349 cable television debt (SOR 1.h). Applicant’s 
student loans (SOR 1.c) were $2,414 past due. Applicant and his spouse were 30 days late 
in paying their second mortgage as of October 2012. They had two car loans that were 
current. In addition to the $23,946 loan for her car from 2011, Applicant and his spouse 
had taken out a $22,783 car loan for his vehicle in July 2012. (GE 9.) 
 
As of January 2013, Applicant’s spouse was in default of her student loan debt 
totaling $43,996.66. She entered into a loan rehabilitation program in mid-January 2013 
under which she agreed to pay $337 per month for nine consecutive months to remove her 
federal student loans from default. As of August 12, 2013, her student loan balance was 
about $42,833. (AE H.) 
 
On January 13, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about his debts and the reasons that led to 
him being denied a security clearance in 2006. He expressed regret for his lack of candor 
during his previous investigation, which he did not intend to repeat. As for the debts on his 
credit record, Applicant indicated that after he had completed his latest e-QIP, a hospital 
obtained a small claims judgment of $1,184 against him in July 2012 that he was repaying 
at $35 per month. Applicant believed it should have been covered by his medical insurer, 
so he did not pay it. Applicant disputed the $593 consumer credit debt, which he thought 
                                                                                                                                                             
expense or documentation of the repairs. (Tr. 70.)

he had paid as a precondition for his mortgage.
2
 He expressed his intent to pay it if 
required for his security clearance. Applicant was also disputing the $500 rental car bill, 
contending that it should have been covered by his auto insurer. As for the discrepancy in 
his student loan balance, Applicant explained that he listed on his e-QIP the annual 
payment required on his student loans rather than the $28,617 balance. He acknowledged 
he had made no payments on his delinquent student loans, but he was in the process of 
establishing a repayment plan with a starting date in February 2013 to remove his loans 
from default status. Applicant thought he had paid off his wireless phone account when he 
switched providers, and he planned to contact the creditor by late February 2013 to 
determine whether the $779 balance was valid. When asked about a $6,661 past-due debt 
on his credit record, Applicant explained that he had exceeded the mileage on a lease but 
he would not pay the debt until he received a report setting out the fees. Applicant did not 
recognize the $349 cable debt on his credit record, although he did not deny he had an 
account with the creditor before October 2011. Applicant claimed to not know that he was 
behind on his second mortgage because his payments were being made automatically. 
Applicant admitted that he had settled some consumer credit accounts for less than their 
full balances, including a $9,790 auto loan debt. He attributed his financial problems to 
overreliance on consumer credit cards; the purchase of his home; the costs of raising two 
children, both of whom had medical issues when they were younger; and the loss of his 
spouse’s income around 2009. She collected worker’s compensation for seven months 
after an injury. He reported that he was paying his current debts on time, including two car 
payments, child care expenses, and commuting costs. Applicant expressed his intent to 
repay his debts. (GE 3.) 
 
As of April 2013, the $100 medical debt, $779 wireless phone debt, and $593 
consumer credit debt were still in collection (SOR 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e). Applicant’s student 
loan balance had accrued to $34,250 (SOR 1.c) and was in collection. A new credit card 
account opened in January 2012 had been closed by the grantor and was in collection with 
a balance of $4,605 as of December 2012 (SOR 1.f). His second mortgage was current, 
although it had been 60 days behind the previous month. Applicant reportedly owed a 
$6,661 charged-off balance on the auto lease (SOR 1.g). (GE 8.) 
 
 Around late April 2013, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant because of nine unpaid 
delinquent debts. (Tr. 8.) As of his May 23, 2013, response to the allegations, Applicant 
had satisfied only the $1,184 judgment. (AE B.) Over the next few months, Applicant 
reached repayment arrangements with his remaining creditors, as set forth in the following 
table.

As of Jan. 2013, creditor 
billed him $500; disputes

for his clearance. (GE 3; Tr. 
42, 65-66.) 
 
 As of July 2013, Applicant had a judgment action for $500 pending against him by a 
children’s medical center. On July 29, 2013, Applicant’s spouse authorized two payments 
of $250 toward the debt, and the creditor withdrew its court action in August 2013. (AE F; 
Tr. 38-39.) As of July 1, 2013, Applicant and his spouse owed delinquent personal property 
taxes on their vehicles for 2010 through 2012 totaling $1,898.77. On July 29, 2013, they 
satisfied a judgment against them for the unpaid taxes. (AE G; Tr. 69.) 
 
 In August 2013, Applicant and his spouse took a one-week vacation to Bermuda, 
which cost them about $2,400. (Tr. 62.) Their income tax refund for 2012 was around 
$2,000. Applicant is not clear what they did with the funds (“I don’t exactly remember how I 
used each penny of it. We use every single dime we have.”). (Tr. 59.) 
  
Applicant earns between $60,000 and $75,000 annually. His spouse is a teacher, 
who earns an annual salary around $79,000. (Tr. 58-59.) They took her lump-sum payout 
that she receives every year and put it toward their debts instead of summer activities for 
their children or refurbishing their home. (Tr. 67.) Under their household budget, Applicant 
and his spouse have net monthly income of $169, provided they make no contributions to 
retirement or college savings. Applicant and his spouse’s monthly mortgage payments total 
about $2,000 ($1,375 on the first mortgage and $625 on the second mortgage). (AE J; Tr. 
73.) Their car payments for two vehicles total $983 because of the high interest rate on 
their loans.
3
 Applicant and his spouse trade in their vehicles every three or four years, 
when the mileage reaches 100,000. (Tr. 69-70.) Both he and his spouse have lengthy 
commutes to work. He drives 120 miles a day while she drives over 100 miles a day. (Tr. 
60.)  Daycare and before and after school care expenses total $1,080 per month. As of 
September 2013, Applicant’s spouse was committed to paying $50 per month toward her 
student loans. Applicant has budgeted for $600 per month toward debt payments 
(including his student loans), $100 per month for his children’s extracurricular activities, 
and $300 a month for discretionary expenses. (AE J.) Applicant and his spouse had an 
estimated $1,000 in checking account deposits as of September 2013. (Tr. 59.)  
 
Applicant has held several different leadership roles during his ten years with the 
defense contractor. His current duties include oversight of the training requirements for his 
361 co-workers. Managers in the piping department attest to Applicant’s willingness to 
                                                 
3 
Applicant’s spouse drives a 2011 model-year vehicle while he drives a 2012 model-year sedan.  The interest 
rate on his vehicle loan is 15.5% because of his poor credit. Applicant testified, “I need a brand new car, 
because we both put about 100,000 miles in three years, as we roll cars over.” (Tr. 68.)

volunteer for challenging tasks. He has demonstrated effective, trustworthy, and efficient 
leadership. (AEs A, K.) 
 
Applicant is involved in his local community as one of the directors of a youth soccer 
club. He has taken on an active role in its recreation program and implemented new 
initiatives to increase its membership base. The current treasurer of the soccer club attests 
to the seriousness with which Applicant has taken his fiduciary obligations to the club. (AE 
L.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
 
 9 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns about financial considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
Applicant defaulted on his student loans for the first time around 2001. At his 
previous security clearance hearing in August 2005, he presented evidence showing some 
payments in 2005 as a precondition of his acceptance into a student loan rehabilitation 
program. By August 2012, his student loans (SOR 1.c) were again in default. In addition, 
he owed delinquent debts of almost $1,200 to a local hospital for services incurred in 2008 
and 2009 (SOR 1.a and 1.b); of $349 to a cable company (SOR 1.h); of $779 to a wireless 
phone provider (SOR 1.d); and of $558 on a consumer credit account (SOR 1.e). His April 
2013 credit report shows that he opened a credit card account in January 2012 on which 
he incurred $4,721 in charges by March 2012. By December 2012, his account had been 
closed by the creditor due to nonpayment of a $4,605 balance (SOR 1.f). Around August 
2012, Applicant turned in a leased vehicle with excess mileage. The creditor is demanding 
a $6,661 debt balance (SOR 1.g) that Applicant is unwilling to pay without documentation 
of the fees. Applicant is also being held liable for $500 in costs for a rental car damaged in 
an accident more than four years ago (SOR 1.i). Applicant disputes his insurer’s denials of 
coverage. Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” 
and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” are established because of 
his record of financial delinquency. 
 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” does 
not apply because his financial problems are recent and some debts have not been paid. 
Applicant satisfied the hospital judgment (SOR 1.a and 1.b) around April 2013. Even so, 
despite household income around $130,000 annually, Applicant and his spouse incurred 
new judgment debt in 2013 for unpaid personal property (vehicle) taxes of $1,898.77 for 
2010 through 2012. A children’s medical center filed for a judgment against Applicant 
which was withdrawn in August 2013 after Applicant’s spouse made payments. Although 
the tax and medical judgments cannot provide separate bases for security disqualification 
under Guideline F because they were not alleged under that guideline, they may 
 
 10 
appropriately be considered for other purposes including whether Applicant’s financial 
problems are recent or ongoing.

Applicant attributes his failure to address his debts for several years to 
circumstances of everyday life, including the costs of raising two children who were ill when 
they were younger; hurricanes (“things happened with the house”); his and his spouse’s 
budget; and the failure of his spouse’s income to keep pace with her insurance costs. (Tr. 
61.) Medical expenses for his children (SOR 1.a and 1.b as well as the latest children’s 
medical center debt) are circumstances contemplated within mitigating condition AG ¶ 
20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under 
the circumstances.” Damage to his home caused by weather could also fall within AG ¶ 
20(b), although Applicant did not present proof of these costs or of damages. Even 
assuming unexpected, nondiscretionary costs, it is difficult to find that Applicant has acted 
responsibly toward some of his creditors. He paid the medical debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b, 
and the consumer credit debt in SOR 1.e only after judgments were issued against him. 
His credit card delinquency in SOR 1.f is recent. After Applicant reapplied for a security 
clearance, he and his spouse inexplicably gave priority to resolving her delinquent 
accounts (e.g., her student loans around $43,919 and some credit card debts) over his 
debts and their delinquent vehicle taxes for 2010 through 2012. Applicant testified that his 
spouse’s lump-sum payout in 2013 went to their debts rather than to the usual summer 
activities for their children or refurbishing their home. (Tr. 67.) Yet, the evidence also shows 
that Applicant spent $2,400 for a vacation in August 2013 when he had yet to make any 
payments toward the $6,661 debt for the leased vehicle (SOR 1.g). 
 
 Applicant provided proof that as of September 2013, he had resolved or was making 
payments on the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.b., 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. Mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), 
“the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts,” apply in part, although payments made in response to court action (SOR 1.a, 
1.b,1.e, the $500 children’s medical center and $1,898.77 vehicle tax debts) or after 
collection (SOR 1.c and 1.f) do not carry the same weight in mitigation had Applicant made 
payments before his accounts became seriously delinquent. He testified that he paid off 
the wireless phone debt in SOR 1.d within the last two months and that his spouse told him 
that the cable debt in SOR 1.h had also been paid. Post-hearing submissions from 
Applicant did not include evidence of debt satisfaction for either debt. Moreover, neither AG 
¶ 20(c) nor AG ¶ 20(d) applies to the leased car debt in SOR 1.g or the rental car debt in

The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-
person analysis under Directive Section 6.3. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07218 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). I have 
considered these debts only for these purposes.

SOR 1.i. Applicant has no repayment plans in place for either debt. He claims that he 
would gladly pay the debt in SOR 1.g. While his demand for an accounting of fees is 
reasonable, Applicant presented no documentation of his contacts with this creditor. As of 
April 2013, the creditor was reporting a $6,661 past-due balance on his account. Applicant 
is still disputing his payment liability for the rental car debt (SOR 1.i). The accident occurred 
more than four years ago. Without some evidence showing that Applicant is likely to prevail 
on his dispute, AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
is also not established. 
 
 His effort to address delinquencies in the past year is a significant step in the right 
direction, but the recency of his financial problems continues to raise concerns about his 
judgment and reliability. In addition to the lingering security concerns raised by the 
unaddressed vehicle debts in SOR 1.g and 1.i, he was behind on his second mortgage and 
car loans in January 2013, at a time when he was making few payments on his other debts 
and his annual household income exceeded $130,000. The financial concerns are not fully 
mitigated. 
   
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
5
 
 
When Applicant’s security clearance was denied in January 2006, he was put on 
notice that his financial problems and lack of candor about his delinquencies were of 
considerable concern to the DOD.  Applicant is credited with being largely forthright about 
his debts during his latest background investigation, but it does not mitigate his record of 
recent financial irresponsibility. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
                                                 
5
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 
 12 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every 
debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates 
that he has ‘. . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and 
taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably 
consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in 
evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(‘Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There 
is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). The 
DOHA Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that in a Guideline F case an applicant must act 
responsibly under the circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by conduct which evidences a serious effort to effectuate the plan. See ISCR 
11-08087 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2013). After he was denied career advancement at work 
because of no clearance, Applicant began to take credible steps to rectify his poor credit. 
He satisfied the medical judgment in the SOR and a tax judgment that was not alleged. In 
July 2013, he satisfied the consumer credit debt in SOR 1.c brought to judgment. Applicant 
has repayment plans in place to address his student loan debt and also the credit card 
debt in SOR 1.f, which together constitute more than 80% of his remaining delinquencies. 
As of August 2013, Applicant had made three months of payments on the two debts. 
 
 At the hearing, the Government expressed lingering concern over Applicant’s ability 
to handle his finances going forward because he did not maintain his student loan 
payments after his 2005 hearing; he disregarded most of his debts before the SOR was 
issued; and he took a foreign vacation at a cost of $2,400 when some debts are still not 
addressed. Applicant testified that he and his spouse “use every single dime [they] have.” 
(Tr. 59.) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a budget showing they can afford to make the 
debt payments already promised to their creditors with $169 in excess monthly income 
after expenses, although with no savings toward retirement or college funds for their 
daughters. Under this budget, Applicant has available $600 per month for his debts, 
including his $34,277 in student loans, and $50 per month for his spouse’s $42,833 in 
student loan debt. He believes he paid the $1,128 in cable and utility debt in collection, but 
he provided no proof of debt satisfaction. There are no payment plans in place for the 
vehicle debts in SOR 1.g and 1.i. 
 
Security clearance decisions are not intended as punishment for past wrongdoing or 
irresponsibility. Applicant had some unplanned expenses that were nondiscretionary, such 
as the medical costs for his daughters. Student loans are a justifiable expense and 
constitute the majority of his remaining delinquent debt balances. Even so, it is particularly 
troubling that his creditors had to aggressively pursue him in court or through collection. 
 
 13 
Knowing that his advancement at work was hindered because of a lack of security 
clearance, he still chose to spend $2,400 for a foreign vacation with his spouse in August 
2013. Applicant has a well-documented record of leadership and valuable contributions to 
his defense contractor employer that weighs in his favor. However, it is well settled that 
once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a 
strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. 
Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990.). Based on the facts before me and the 
adjudicative guidelines that I am required to consider, I am unable to conclude that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this 
time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST THE APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:   Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
