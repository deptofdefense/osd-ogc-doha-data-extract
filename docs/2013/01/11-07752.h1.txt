HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 11 delinquent debts, totaling 
$57,932. He placed six SOR debts into a debt consolidation plan (DCP). He did not 
timely file his federal tax returns for 2005 to 2010, and he owes the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) about $31,000. He also owes a 2009 state tax debt of $2,072. Financial 
considerations are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 10, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
July 18, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information 
available to the Government, DOD adjudicators could not make the preliminary 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant’s security clearance, and it recommended that his case be submitted 
to an administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On August 29, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On November 8, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
Applicant’s case. On November 19, 2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to me. On 
November 27, 2012, the DOD Hearings and Appeals Office issued a hearing notice, 
setting the hearing for December 19, 2012. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as 
scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, and Applicant 
offered two exhibits. (Tr. 14-15; GE 1-4; AE A, B) There were no objections, and I 
admitted GE 1-4 and AE A, B. (Tr. 14-16) On December 28, 2012, I received the 
transcript of the hearing. Applicant did not provide any post-hearing evidence.

for six months; and in November 2008, he began working for his current employer. (Tr. 
19-20) He has been working full time since November 2008. (Tr. 21) His current base 
salary is $71,000. (Tr. 20) 
 
Applicant’s credit reports, SOR, and March 8, 2011 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) discuss 11 delinquent debts, 
totaling $57,932.

June of 2012. (Tr. 26) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant owed $2,072 to state tax authority S for a state tax 
lien filed in September 2009. S contended that he owed state taxes for 2005. (Tr. 26) 
Applicant disputed the debt, indicating he paid state income taxes to state tax authority 
W, the location where he lived. (Tr. 26-27) He contended that S should have given him 
a credit for taxes paid to W. (Tr. 26-27) He learned on December 18, 2012, the day 
before his hearing, the basis for S’s claim of taxes owed. (Tr. 28) He did not submit 
documentation to S disputing the debt. (Tr. 28)    
 
On October 18, 2006, Applicant filed his tax return for 2005. (AE B at 2) On 
December 13, 2010, Applicant filed his tax returns for 2006 to 2009. (AE B at 5, 7, 9, 
11) On March 2, 2012, Applicant filed his tax return for 2010. (AE B at 13) On April 15, 
2012, he filed his federal tax return for 2011. (Tr. 36) He said he knew he owed on his 
taxes, and he did not timely file his tax returns because he didn’t have the money to pay 
his taxes. (Tr. 41)   
 
On March 8, 2011, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he owed the IRS: 
$8,364 for 2006; $2,854 for 2007; $4,058 for 2008; and $4,643 for 2009, for a total of 
$19,919. (GE 4 at 126) In December 2010, he submitted a payment plan to the IRS, 
offering to pay $250 per month. (GE 4 at 126)   
 
In March and April 2012, the IRS levied $4,842 from Applicant’s pay. (AE B at 4) 
After an initial payment of $1,461 on March 5, 2012, the IRS was garnishing $1,000 per 
month from his pay. (AE B at 4) On April 24, 2012, Applicant established an IRS 
installment agreement whereby he would pay $450 per month. (AE B at 4) He began 
making the agreed upon payments on September 2012. (AE B at 4) SOR ¶ 1.k alleges 
that Applicant owes the IRS $41,912 based on a federal tax lien. (Tr. 40; GE 2 at 74; 
GE 4 at 126) On April 17, 2012, Applicant filed amended tax returns for 2008 to 2011, 
deducting alimony paid to his former spouse. (Tr. 39) On July 2, 2012, the IRS granted 
him a $1,575 credit for tax year 2008, a $2,972 credit for tax year 2009, and a $3,024

credit for tax years 2010 and 2011. (AE B at 10, 12, 14, 16; Tr. 39-40) He also received 
some reduced or removed penalties. (AE B at 10, 12, 14, 16; Tr. 39-40) His December 
18, 2012 IRS tax transcripts for 2005 to 2011 provide the following information:

Total  $32,5022  
 
On June 11, 2012, Applicant established a debt consolidation program (DCP), 
which will address 12 of his debts. He pays $200 monthly into his DCP. (AE A) His DCP 
will address the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($969), 1.e ($1,693), 1.f ($1,133), 1.g ($270), 1.h 
($1,545), and 1.j ($191), as well as several other non-SOR delinquent debts. (AE A) 
The name of the creditor and the amount of the debt do not match the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.d ($982) and 1.i ($81). (Tr. 41-42; AE A) He offered to add the two missing debts to 
his DCP. (Tr. 43) Aside from his initiation of the DCP, which paid one non-SOR debt for 
$850 (settled for $450), he did not make any payments to the SOR creditors. (Tr. 30) He 
believed all of his creditors were included in the DCP. (Tr. 30)  
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) includes his $450 monthly 
payment to the IRS and his $200 monthly payments to the DCP. (GE 4 at 124) He has a 
monthly net remainder of $48. (GE 4 at 124) Applicant said “basically right now my 
paycheck doesn’t really get me through a pay period.” (Tr. 33) Sometimes he is unable 
to pay for utilities or cable. (Tr. 34) He does not have a savings account, and he has 
about $300 in his checking account. (Tr. 34) He recently purchased another vehicle, 
and he will have a $230 monthly vehicle payment on a $5,000 loan. (Tr. 35, 43) 
  
Applicant has not had credit counseling. (Tr. 49) He attributes his financial 
problems to having to support three households: he has to pay his first wife $900 per 
month in alimony; his second wife lives in another state; and he has his own apartment.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations (Guideline F) 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the 
same.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SF 86, his OPM interview, his SOR response, and his statement at 
his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts, totaling $57,932. He placed six 
SOR debts into a DCP. He did not timely file his federal tax returns for 2005 to 2010,3 
                                            
3 26 U.S.C. § 7203 provides: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this 
title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by 
law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
and he owes the IRS about $31,000. He also owes a 2009 state tax debt of $2,072. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of Applicant’s SOR debts and 
his failure to timely file his federal tax returns. The non-tax debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c to 1.j are 
mitigated because Applicant established a DCP, and he made several payments into 
the DCP. He credibly stated that he would add the two missing SOR debts into the 
DCP. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, a federal tax debt for $7,084, is mitigated because it is 
included in the federal tax debt of $41,912 in SOR ¶ 1.k. All of his federal tax debts are 
now consolidated into his IRS installment agreement. 
 
Even though Applicant was aware that he owed the IRS a significant amount of 
money, he did not make any progress paying this debt until the IRS started garnishing 
                                                                                                                                             
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 [26 USCS 
§ 6654 or 6655] with respect to such failure. 
 
Applicant has not been charged with violating 26 U.S.C. § 7203. The SOR did not allege a security 
concern under Guideline J (criminal conduct), and no adverse inference is made against Applicant for his 
possible violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203.

his pay.4 In March and April 2012, the IRS levied $4,842 from Applicant’s pay. After an 
initial payment of $1,461 on March 5, 2012, the IRS was garnishing $1,000 per month 
from his pay. On April 24, 2012, he established an IRS installment agreement, and he 
agreed to pay $450 per month. He began making the agreed upon IRS payments in 
September 2012. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. Applicant is living 
paycheck to paycheck, and he will soon have a car payment that he cannot afford. This 
car payment, if made, will jeopardize his payment plans. 
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to brief periods of unemployment 
several years ago, his separation from his family, his establishment and maintenance of 
multiple households, and his divorce. These were circumstances largely beyond 
Applicant’s control.  
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted in good faith to resolve his delinquent 
SOR debts.5 From 2005 to 2011, his income ranged from $72,874 (2008) to $86,622 
(2011). He had the means to make more progress resolving his delinquent federal tax 
debts. He did not prove that he maintained contact with most of his SOR creditors,6 and 
he did not prove that he made sufficient attempts to timely establish his payment plan 
with the IRS or with state tax authority S (SOR ¶ 1.a). He did not establish “there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He did not prove 
that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
Applicant’s most significant Guideline F problem is his failure to timely file his 
federal tax returns. On December 13, 2010, Applicant filed his tax returns for 2006 to 
2009. On March 2, 2012, Applicant filed his tax return for 2010. From December 2010 to 
                                            
4See ISCR Case No. 08-06059 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009) (indicating involuntary payment of 
debts through garnishment is not necessarily mitigating). 
   
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

April 2012, he failed to take reasonable action in a timely fashion to resolve his 
delinquent taxes. AG ¶ 20(e) is not fully applicable. Applicant did not provide 
documentation showing he was disputing the state tax debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $2,072.  
 
In sum, Applicant has not provided enough evidence to establish that additional 
delinquent debt is unlikely to recur. His track record of financial responsibility shows 
insufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of 
financial considerations concerns. It is likely that his financial problems will continue.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
reinstatement of his access to classified information. He is a 56-year-old principal field 
engineer for a defense contractor. He is a high school graduate who achieved some 
educational and training certifications while serving on active duty and working for 
companies. He has four adult children. He served on active duty in the Army for 22 
years and retired as a sergeant first class in 1996. He served overseas in Germany, 
South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Panama. His service in Southwest Asia was for 
Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He held a Top Secret clearance while in 
the Army, and he has not held a security clearance since leaving active duty. There is 
no evidence of any security violations. Circumstances largely beyond Applicant’s control 
adversely affected his finances, including establishing and maintaining three 
households, separations, a divorce, and brief periods of unemployment several years 
ago. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security 
responsibilities. He recently began a DCP, which will resolve all of his delinquent, non-
tax debts. He began making payments on a payment plan that is satisfactory to the IRS

in September 2012. He is an asset to his company and his family. He deserves 
substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a 
defense contractor and for his years of active duty Army service. There is every 
indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. These factors show 
some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. He is an intelligent person, and his failure to timely file his federal tax 
returns from 2005 to 2010 was irresponsible. Year after year he had an opportunity to 
comply with statutory federal tax requirements, and he knowingly chose not to do so. He 
had the ability and resources to make greater progress resolving his tax debts. He did 
not resolve his 2009 state tax lien. His PFS shows he is living paycheck to paycheck. 
Nevertheless, he recently purchased a vehicle, which may place his other payment 
plans in jeopardy. There is an insufficient track record of SOR debt payment. There are 
not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He did not 
prove that he acted responsibly with respect to his debts under the circumstances. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated at this time.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not fully mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b to 1.j:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.k:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
