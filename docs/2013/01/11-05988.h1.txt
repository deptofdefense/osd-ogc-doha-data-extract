TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 15 delinquent debts, totaling 
$31,897. In addition, he has about $35,000 in delinquent tax debt. He did not make 
sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. Financial considerations are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 11, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
April 2, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the 
Government, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance, 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a 
determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On April 13, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
May 17, 2012, Department Counsel was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On July 
18, 2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to another administrative judge. On August 1, 
2012, his case was transferred to another administrative judge, and on August 11, 
2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to me. On November 29, 2012, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for December 19, 
2012. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel 
offered seven exhibits, and Applicant offered two exhibits. (Tr. 15-18; GE 1-5; AE A, B) 
There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 and AE A and B. (Tr. 15-16, 18) On 
January 3, 2013, I received the transcript of the hearing. After the hearing, Department 
Counsel forwarded three exhibits submitted by Applicant, which were admitted without 
objection. (AE C-E) On January 11, 2013, I closed the record.    
   
Procedural Issue 
 
Applicant requested a six-month delay in his case because he had temporary 
duties at three locations away from his home from January to November 2012. (Tr. 9-
12; AE A) He said he would use the additional time to hire a credit repair company and 
pay all of his bills. (Tr. 12) Department Counsel opposed the request for delay, citing 
Applicant’s two previous continuances. (Tr. 9) I denied the request for continuance; 
however, I authorized him to submit documentation after his hearing until January 11, 
2013. (Tr. 10, 13, 51-52, 56) Applicant said he would be on leave for two weeks after his 
hearing, and he would “be able to fix” his financial problems by January 11, 2013. (Tr. 
12, 56) On January 11, 2013, Applicant submitted an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
release of levy, dated January 13, 2013, and debt consolidation plan account statement 
showing payment of $206 on January 11, 2013. (AE C, D, E)   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant accepted responsibility for the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a to 1.o. He also provided some mitigating information. His admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old instructor for soldiers, who has been working for a 
large government contractor since October 2004. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1) In 1982, he 
graduated from high school. (Tr. 19) He earned 11 college credits. (Tr. 20) In 1982, he 
joined the Army and served in the infantry on active duty for 22 years, and in October 
2004, he honorably retired from the Army as a first sergeant (E-8). (Tr. 20-21) He has 
been married three times. (Tr. 22) In December 2005, he married his current spouse. 
(Tr. 22) He has four children, who are ages 1, 6, 13, and 17 years old. (Tr. 22-23) His 
security clearance from his active duty service was carried over to his employment as a 
civilian employee of a government contractor. (Tr. 17) There are no allegations of 
security violations.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SF 86, credit reports, SOR response, and hearing discuss 15 
delinquent debts, totaling $31,897 as follows: 1.a ($246), 1.b ($130), 1.c ($608), 1.d 
($621), 1.e ($1,083), 1.f ($1,145), 1.g ($777), 1.h ($13,048), 1.i ($290), 1.j $3,645), 1.k 
($991), 1.l ($147), 1.m ($290), 1.n ($1,910), and 1.o ($6,966). None of the debts in the 
SOR are paid. (Tr. 41)  
 
Applicant’s financial problems began in 2004, when he was divorced from the 
mother of two of his children. (Tr. 46) The court ordered him to pay monthly support of 
$2,200, and his monthly income at that time was $4,500. (Tr. 47-48) The divorce 
caused him to generate about $50,000 in debt. (Tr. 48) He was unable to locate his 
children, and he decided to stop paying support to their mother. (Tr. 48-49) He also 
suffered from depression. (Tr. 49)  
 
Applicant is paying $1,500 monthly child support for his three older children to 
two different mothers. (Tr. 23-25, 31) He is also paying about $1,100 monthly to 
address his back child support debt of about $8,000. (Tr. 31) His child support is current 
for two of his children. (Tr. 33) 
 
Applicant’s February 2012 personal financial statement (PFS) indicates his gross 
monthly salary is approximately $6,500; his monthly deductions are $5,400; his 
remainder before expenses is $1,165; his monthly expenses are $1,650; and his 
monthly net remainder is negative $500. (Tr. 26, 37; GE 3) He did not include his 
spouse’s salary in his PFS, and he is not aware of the amount of her salary. (Tr. 34) 
After deducting her share of the monthly expenses, his share of monthly expenses is 
$1,650. (Tr. 27, 34-37) She separately filed her tax returns. (Tr. 40) 
 
Applicant’s pay is being garnished $400 every two weeks to pay a state tax debt 
for years 2005 to 2011. (Tr. 28, 30) He did not file his state and federal tax returns for 
2005 to 2011. (Tr. 29-30) He did not file his federal income tax returns because he was, 
“simply depressed [and] couldn’t afford it,” and he is “a procrastinator.” (Tr. 29, 39, 41, 
51) He is planning on filing his federal tax returns for 2005 to 2011 soon, most likely in 
four to six months. (Tr. 28, 50) He has not provided the W-2 and other tax documents to 
his federal tax preparer; however, he has hired the federal tax return preparer and 
provided a power of attorney to the federal tax preparer. (Tr. 44) He estimated his 
delinquent federal and state taxes totaled $30,000 or $40,000. (Tr. 30, 43) On January 
11, 2013, Applicant submitted an IRS release of levy, dated January 13, 2013. (AE C, 
D) The IRS levy was not signed by an IRS employee, and Applicant indicated the tax 
levy will be removed. (AE C, D) The amount of the IRS levy is unknown.       
  
Applicant’s SF 86 lists six debts. (GE 1) He said his two child support debts owed 
to the mother of two of his children were “paid up and in good standing.”1 He did not 
know the status of one $3,500 debt. He described a debt resulting from a vehicle

repossession as having an unknown status; one debt was being paid; and one debt was 
in the process of being paid off.  
 
Section 25.1.c of his SF 86 asks, “Have you failed to pay Federal, state, or other 
taxes, or to file a tax return, when required by law or ordnance?” (GE 1) Section 25.1.p 
of his SF 86 asks, “Are you currently delinquent on any Federal debt?” Applicant 
indicated, “No” to both questions and failed to disclose that he failed to file his state and 
federal taxes from 2005 to 2011, and he owed thousands of dollars of delinquent state 
and federal taxes. (Tr. 41-43; GE 1)2 
 
Applicant does not have any savings; however, he does have $2,500 in a 401(k) 
account. (Tr. 38) In 2010, he borrowed $2,500 from his 401(k) account; and he was 
unsure how much remained to be repaid on this loan. (Tr. 38) He received financial 
counseling in 2009. (Tr. 45-46) In his April 13, 2012 SOR response, Applicant said, “I 
am in the process of clearing all of my debts.”  
 
Applicant did not stay in touch with his creditors. (Tr. 50) He believes he can 
establish a debt consolidation plan and eventually pay his delinquent debts. (Tr. 50-51) 
He met with a debt consolidation plan company representative a few days after his 
hearing, and he provided a debt consolidation plan account statement showing payment 
of $206 on January 11, 2013. (Tr. 51; AE C, E)          
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is

Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he failed to disclose his failure to file his federal and state 
income tax returns from 2005 to 2011 on his SF 86, and that he owes federal and state tax debts of about 
$30,000 for tax years 2005 to 2011. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal 
Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Consideration of the non-SOR allegations outlined in this decision is strictly limited to 
these five circumstances.

clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations (Guideline F) 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SF 86, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s SOR and credit reports allege 15 delinquent debts, totaling $31,897. 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of Applicant’s SOR debts. 
Applicant said his delinquent debts were caused by his 2004 divorce, depression, and 
child support obligations. He was issued an SOR on April 2, 2012, and his progress was 
very limited. On January 11, 2013, Applicant submitted an IRS release of levy, dated 
January 13, 2013, and debt consolidation plan account statement showing payment of 
$206 on January 11, 2013. The IRS levy was not signed by an IRS employee, and 
Applicant indicated the tax levy will be removed. At the time of his hearing, Applicant 
had not contacted 14 of his SOR creditors. He did not provide proof that made any 
payments to any of the SOR creditors, except his pay was being garnished to pay his 
child support debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($6,966).3 I credited Applicant with mitigating the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.o because he is making some payments on this debt.  
 
Applicant is not given full credit for the financial counseling he received about 
three years ago because his progress has been so limited, and he has not provided a 
credible budget showing how he will pay his SOR and tax debts. Applicant is living 
paycheck to paycheck; he is unsure about his federal income tax liability; and he was 
not able to explain why he has not reduced his expenses so that he will have the 
resources to make greater progress paying his debts.  
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his 2004 divorce, depression, and 
child support obligations. These were circumstances largely beyond Applicant’s control; 
however, he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did 
not provide enough details to establish the link between the unanticipated 
circumstances and his inability to make greater progress paying his SOR debts over the 
last three years.  
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted in good faith to resolve his delinquent 
SOR debts.4 He did not describe any substantial decreases in his income over the last 
                                            
3
See Generally ISCR Case No. 08-06059 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009) (indicating involuntary 
payment of debts through garnishment is not necessarily mitigating). 
   
4
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
three years. He had the means to make more progress resolving his delinquent SOR 
debts. He did not prove that he maintained contact with 14 of his SOR creditors,5 and 
he did not prove that he made sufficient attempts to timely establish payment plans. He 
did not establish “there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.”   
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not provide documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or of evidence of actions to resolve any debts.    
 
In sum, Applicant has not provided enough evidence to establish that additional 
delinquent debt is unlikely to recur. I have credited Applicant with mitigating his child 
support debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($6,966) because he is making sufficient progress to satisfy 
the court that is garnishing his pay. His track record of financial responsibility shows 
insufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of 
financial considerations concerns. Applicant has 15 SOR debts totaling $31,897 and 
about $35,000 in state and federal tax debts to resolve, and it is likely that financial 
problems will continue.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
                                                                                                                                            
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
reinstatement of his access to classified information. Applicant is a 49-year-old 
instructor for soldiers, who has been working for a large government contractor since 
October 2004. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security 
responsibilities. He is a high school graduate with 11 college credits. He honorably 
served in the infantry on active duty for 22 years. In October 2004, he retired from the 
Army as a first sergeant. In December 2005, he married his spouse. He has four 
children, who are ages 1, 6, 13, and 17 years old. His security clearance from his active 
duty service was carried over to his employment as a civilian employee of a government 
contractor, and there are no allegations of security violations. Applicant attributes his 
financial problems to three circumstances largely beyond his control: (1) his 2004 
divorce; (2) his depression; and (3) his child support obligations. Applicant submitted a 
January 13, 2013 IRS release of levy, and a debt consolidation plan account statement 
showing payment of $206 on January 11, 2013. His pay was being garnished to pay his 
child support debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($6,966), and he is credited with making the payments 
the court desires to address that debt. He receives some credit for the financial 
counseling he received about three years ago. He deserves substantial credit for 
volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a defense contractor 
and for his 22 years of active duty Army service. There is every indication that he is 
loyal to the United States and his employer. These factors show some responsibility, 
rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. Applicant is a retired first sergeant and Army trainer. He is an 
intelligent person, and his failure to pay or start payment plans on more of his 15 SOR 
debts was irresponsible. The SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m are less than 
$300 each; nevertheless, they were not paid or resolved. Applicant failed to provide a 
detailed explanation of how circumstances beyond his control caused him not to make 
greater progress paying more of his SOR debts. He had the ability and resources to 
make greater progress resolving his debts, if he would have reduced his expenses. His 
PFS shows he is living paycheck to paycheck and unable or unwilling to make 
significant payments to 14 of his 15 SOR creditors. He failed to timely file his state and 
federal tax returns for 2005 to 2011, and he estimated he may owe about $35,000 in 
taxes. His federal tax returns for those years are not filed and are not expected to be 
filed for several months. He did not provide specific details concerning any payment 
plans to address 14 SOR debts. It is not clear that Applicant will make the sacrifices 
necessary to reduce his expenses, freeing up funds to pay his delinquent debts. There 
are not “clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He did 
not prove that he had a sufficient track record of debt payment, or that he acted

responsibly with respect to his debts under all of the circumstances. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated at this time. 
    
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not fully mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.n:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
