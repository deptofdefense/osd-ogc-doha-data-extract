LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated personal conduct security concerns, but he has not mitigated 
financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 2, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines 
E (personal conduct) and F (financial considerations). The action was taken under 
Executive Order (EO) 010865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on June 7, 2012, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 
20, 2012. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2012, scheduling the 
 
2 
 
hearing for November 28, 2012. The case was reassigned to me on November 26, 
2012. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 
were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits 
(AE) A through R, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for 
Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted documents that were marked 
AE S through RR and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on December 7, 2012.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 46-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since October 2011. He has worked in the defense industry and 
held a security clearance for more than 20 years. He has a bachelor’s degree. He is 
married with a child in college.1 
  
 Applicant started a limited liability company (LLC)2 to do defense contracts in 
about 2004. Applicant reported that the company’s revenue was about $279,000 in 
2005; $688,000 in 2006; $878,000 in 2007; and $1,080,000 in 2008. He stated that the 
profit was about 8% of the revenue, and the LLC paid him a salary of $120,000 to 
$130,000. His income tax returns showed adjusted gross income of $165,012 in 2007; 
$75,185 in 2008; negative $110,651 in 2009; $14,854 in 2010; and $10,675 in 2011. 
Applicant used business loans and lines of credit for the company.3 
 
 In 2006, Applicant bought a house for $997,000 in a city where the real estate 
market was booming. Applicant made a down payment of about $100,000, and the rest 
of the purchase price was financed with an $800,000 mortgage loan and a $100,000 
second mortgage loan. Both mortgage loans were obtained from the same bank.4 
 
 When the real estate market crashed, several creditors closed or lowered the 
lines of credit Applicant used for his business. The company was awarded a 
government contract in 2008. The contract gave the government the right to do 
business with the LLC, but did not guarantee a set amount of work. The LLC did not 
receive enough work to remain viable. Applicant used his personal credit to pay

2 A limited liability company is a business structure allowed by state statute. LLCs are popular because, 
similar to a corporation, owners have limited personal liability for the debts and actions of the LLC. Other 
features of LLCs are more like a partnership, providing management flexibility and the benefit of pass-
through taxation. . . .The federal government does not recognize an LLC as a classification for federal tax 
purposes. An LLC business entity must file as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship tax return.

company expenses. In early 2009, Applicant informed his employees that they needed 
to look for another job, and Applicant also started looking for new employment.5 
 
 Applicant interviewed with a defense contractor in 2009. He thought the company 
wanted to hire him as a consultant, but the company hired him as a regular employee in 
August 2009. Applicant still had his LLC. His employer felt it would be a conflict of 
interest for Applicant to work for the company and also work for the LLC. He was hired 
on the condition that he commit to giving up working for his LLC. Applicant had health 
problems, and he needed time to close the LLC. He closed the LLC’s office space and 
sold much of the company’s equipment. Applicant stated that the LLC did not do any 
business while he worked for his employer, but he did not terminate the LLC as a 
business entity.6 
 
 In about April 2010, Applicant’s supervisor told him that Applicant would likely be 
laid off at the end of his current task in July 2010, and he encouraged Applicant to look 
for a new job. In May 2010, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) informed 
Applicant of possible defense contracting work for his LLC. Applicant did not withhold 
this information from his employer. He invited his employer to attend a meeting on the 
potential contract. The meeting never took place. In early June 2010, Applicant’s 
employer terminated his employment for violation of his agreement to give up his work 
with his LLC.7 
 
 Applicant was unemployed from June 2010 until August 2010. He worked as an 
engineer for a company from August 2010 until he was hired by his current employer in 
February 2011.8 
 
 Applicant’s LLC is still in existence. He owes his state for LLC fees. He paid the 
$800 that was owed for the last tax year, but he still owes almost $10,000 for previous 
tax years.9 
 
 After he closed the LLC’s office space in about August 2009, Applicant 
headquartered the LLC in his home. He stated that he “gave away [the] office furniture 
to other small businesses and stored [the] copier machine at [a self-storage facility].” His 
2009 federal income tax return reported that the LLC had $402,882 in gross sales and 
$387,273 in cost of goods sold, resulting in gross income of $15,609. He reported total 
expenses of $138,761, plus $29,732 for expenses for the business use of his home, 
resulting in a net loss of $152,884. He reported that his house was 2,305 square feet 
and that 1,500 square feet of the home were “used regularly and exclusively” for the

business or for storage of inventory or product samples. Applicant also claimed that his 
two cars were each driven 10,000 miles for business purposes.10 
 
 On his 2010 federal income tax return, Applicant reported that the LLC had 
$281,302 in gross sales and expenses of $340,012, plus $14,773 for expenses for the 
business use of his home, resulting in a net loss of $91,538. He reported that 2,000 of 
the 2,305 square feet of his home were used for the business.11 
 
 Applicant stopped paying the mortgage loans on his home in about July 2009. He 
stated that he stopped paying because he was attempting to have the loans modified. 
His July 2010 request for a loan modification was denied. He paid about $5,100 from 
August to October 2010, and then did not pay anything else toward the loans. The 
home was sold through a short sale for $735,000 in July 2011.12 
 
 Applicant and his wife filed a joint 2011 federal income tax return, but they 
divided the business expenses into his expenses and her expenses. They reported the 
business address of the LLC as the apartment that was rented after their house was 
sold. Applicant reported that the LLC did not have any gross sales. He reported 
business expenses of $31,539, plus $10,500 for expenses for the business use of his 
home, resulting in a net loss of $42,039. He reported that he used 2,000 of the 2,400 
square feet of his home for business. He reported business depreciation of his house at 
$11,261. Expenses for business use of his home were capped at $10,500 for 2011, so 
he carried over $7,783 in operating expenses and $11,261 in depreciation for the 
business use of his home to tax year 2012,. His wife also reported that the LLC did not 
have any gross sales. She reported business expenses of $6,523 resulting in a net loss 
of $6,523. She reported that she used 600 of the 900 square feet of her apartment for 
business. She reported $5,494 for expenses for the business use of the apartment. That 
amount was unable to be applied toward the 2011 tax return, so it carried over to 
2012.13 
 
 The SOR alleges six delinquent debts with balances totaling about $194,000 and 
a past-due second mortgage. Applicant denied owing the delinquent $7,866 credit card 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g and the past-due second mortgage that is alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.f. He established that the credit card debt was settled, and the second mortgage loan 
was resolved through a short sale of his house.14 He admitted owing $36,480 to the 
                                                          
10 Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3. Applicant’s state LLC debt and questionable accounting practices 
were not alleged in the SOR, and they will not be used for disqualification purposes. They may be 
considered when assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating 
conditions, and in analyzing the “whole person.”

creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, but he denied that the account is past due because he 
has been making monthly $100 for the past year. He admitted owing the remaining 
debts, but he stated that he has been making payments on several of the debts. 
Individual debts are discussed below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $51,154 to a collection company on 
behalf of a bank. The collection company filed suit against Applicant and his wife in 
2012, but only his wife was served. She retained an attorney who filed a general denial 
in August 2012. Applicant hopes to settle the debt and lawsuit for $7,000 in April 2013.15 
 
 Applicant admitted owing the $46,573 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.b. He stated it was the LLC’s credit card that he personally guaranteed. He made 
monthly $100 payments from September 2010 to June 2012. In July 2012, he increased 
the payments to $125 per month.16 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a delinquent debt of $19,292 to a company for the lease of a 
copier machine. Applicant’s wife has been sending the company monthly $50 
payments. Applicant asked the creditor if it wanted to repossess the copier. The creditor 
indicated that it preferred to accept the monthly $50 payments until Applicant could sell 
the machine and pay them what he received. Applicant has been unable to sell the 
copier. He stated that if his “LLC gets resurrected in the future, [he] plan[s] to pay off 
[the loan] and continue usage” of the machine.17 
 
 Applicant admitted owing the $36,480 delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d for 
the lease of computer equipment, but he denied that the account was past due. He has 
been making $100 monthly payments since 2011. He stated that he will continue to 
make monthly $100 payments until a settlement can be negotiated. The creditor 
reported the debt as past due. Applicant did not submit anything from the creditor 
stating that the creditor was satisfied with his monthly payments.18 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a delinquent debt of $33,489 to a finance company. Applicant 
borrowed $40,000 from the company in about 2006 to buy a grand piano. He stated that 
he bought the piano as an investment. He testified that he has been paying $50 per 
month for several years. He sold the piano for about $20,000. He used the proceeds to 
pay some other debts and to move his family to their current location. As of September 
2012, the balance on the debt was $31,996.19

 Applicant resolved his delinquent mortgage loans through a short sale of his 
house. The past-due second mortgage loan is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. Applicant 
established that the delinquent $7,866 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g was settled 
in November 2011 for $1,967. The account had a $5,899 balance when the settlement 
amount was paid.20 
 
 Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He has paid, or entered 
into agreements to pay, other debts that are not alleged in the SOR. He is working 
overseas and earns a good salary. He paid $8,232 in November 2012 to pay off a car 
loan. He stated that “will free up $450 per month to settle other creditors more 
aggressively.” He stated that he plans to settle his delinquent debts.21  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of

the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
  
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his financial obligations. He spent beyond his means, as verified by the purchase 
of a $997,000 house and a $40,000 piano when his income could not justify purchases 
of those amounts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
8 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
  The failure of Applicant’s business qualifies as a condition that was outside his 
control. AG ¶ 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the 
circumstances. Applicant may have hoped that his business would generate enough 
income to justify his high-cost purchases, but he was unable to grow or sustain the 
business. He has made some strides in paying and settling his debts, but he still owes 
well in excess of $150,000.  
 
  I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or 
that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts.22 His finances are not yet under 
control. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine that they 
are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG ¶ 
20(b) is partially applicable. The first section of AG ¶ 20(c) is not applicable; the second 
section is only applicable to the second mortgage loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f and the 
settled credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. I find that financial concerns remain 
despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
22 The Appeal Board has explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). 
 
9 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to 
the employer as a condition of employment; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as 
. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s 
personal, professional, or community standing.  
 
 Applicant was hired by a defense contractor on the condition that he commit to 
giving up working for his LLC. His employment was terminated for violation of that 
agreement. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable:  
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
I am convinced that Applicant believed he was acting within the spirit of his 
employment agreement. The LLC was still in existence, but it did not conduct any 
business while Applicant was working for the defense contractor. He did not hide his 
actions from his employer. He thought he was going to be laid off, and he invited his 
employer to attend a meeting on a potential contract for his LLC. I find the conduct 
happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and it does not 
cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 
17(c) and 17(e) are applicable. 
 
 
 
10 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines E and F in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
I have considered Applicant’s long employment history and his work in the 
defense industry, particularly his recent service overseas. Applicant is educated and 
accomplished. His financial problems were mostly related to his failed business. 
However, poor decisions also contributed to his financial problems. He does not yet 
have a track record of fiscally responsible behavior.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated personal conduct security concerns, but he has not mitigated financial 
considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.g:   For Applicant 
 
 
 
11 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
