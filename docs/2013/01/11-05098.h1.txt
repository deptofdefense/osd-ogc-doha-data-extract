NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for a 
position of trust in the defense industry. Since returning to full-time employment in 
November 2010, Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay the $47,000 in 
delinquent debt she accumulated during her previous 22 months of unemployment. 
Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and Department of Defense (DOD) 
Directive,1 on March 28, 2012, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
concerns under the financial considerations guideline. DOD adjudicators recommended 
                                                          
1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as, DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this 
case. The AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). 
The AG replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to determine whether or not 
Applicant is eligible to occupy a public trust position.  
 
Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting an administrative determination. 
On September 11, 2012, she requested a hearing.2 The case was assigned to me on 
November 6, 2012. At the hearing convened on December 11, 2012, I admitted 
Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through D, 
without objection. I received the transcript (Tr.) on December 20, 2012. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant, 59, is a licensed clinical social worker. She holds undergraduate and 
graduate degrees in that field. Employed by a federal contractor since November 2010, 
Applicant works as a health coach clinician, providing counseling to military members 
and their families on a variety of mental-health issues.3 
  
 Her financial problems began in 2009 after being laid off from the job she held for 
17 years as the manager of the medical facility and drug testing program for a state 
agency. Using her severance pay and a withdrawal from her 401(K), Applicant focused 
on keeping her mortgage current, paying expenses of her household, which consisted 
of her then 16-year old son, 18-year-old nephew, and her critically ill sister. Applicant 
was responsible for expenses related to her sister’s medical issues in addition to 
expenses for the treatment of her own serious, chronic medical conditions. Between 
2009 and 2010, Applicant paid approximately $15,000 in out-of-pocket medical 
expenses. She began looking for a new position immediately after being laid off, but 
decided to take private clients to supplement her income. However, she was not making 
enough money to pay her expenses.4  
 
 After exhausting her severance pay, Applicant began receiving unemployment 
compensation in June 2009. She continued to have difficulty paying her living expenses 
on the $239 she received each week. Applicant tried to cut expenses as her job search 
continued. She installed solar panels to save on her utility bills. In August 2009, she had 
her car voluntarily repossessed before the obligation became delinquent, understanding 
that she would be responsible for any deficiency balance. Unemployed for 22 months, 
Applicant used credit cards to cover expenses, as necessary. By the time she began 
her current position, she had incurred delinquent debt to three creditors for 
approximately $48,000.5  
 
 Applicant began contacting her creditors in early 2011 to make payment 
arrangements for her outstanding debts, but she was unable to afford the terms offered

to her at the time. In 2011, she encountered medical issues that required her immediate 
attention and she admits that her finances temporarily took a back seat. Although she 
had medical insurance, Applicant expended over $3,500 for medical expenses in 2011. 
She began to address her delinquent debts in February 2012. Initially, she started with 
small payments and increased them as her salary increased.  Currently, she pays $350 
each month towards the three debts alleged in the SOR. To date, she has paid $2,725 
towards her delinquent debts. In addition to the SOR debts, Applicant has repaid the 
deficiency balance on the 2009 voluntary car repossession and settled two credit card 
accounts for approximately $2,000.6  
 
 Applicant lives within her means and is current on her recurring monthly financial 
obligations. Since her sister passed in August 2012, her monthly expenses have 
decreased. Her son, nephew, and brother (who initially moved in with Applicant to help 
care for their sister as her health declined) contribute to the household expenses. She 
applies her disposable income to reducing her home-equity line of credit or her one 
credit card, which has a balance of less than $500. She has not used credit cards since 
she returned to work in November 2010. She has not replaced her car, instead walking 
or relying on public transportation to get to work.7 
                                    
Policies 
 
 Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”8 
“The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties, is that, based on 
all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such 
that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the national 
interests.”9 Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made.10 An administrative judge’s objective is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision that embraces all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to a public trust position enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Unresolved delinquent debt is a concern because “an individual who is financially 
over extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.”11 
Financial difficulties have proven to be a significant motivating factor for espionage or 
attempted espionage.12 The Government does not have to prove that an applicant 
poses a clear and present danger to national security,13 or that an applicant poses an 
imminent threat of engaging in criminal acts. Instead, it is sufficient to show that an 
applicant has a history of unresolved financial difficulties that may make her more 
vulnerable to financial pressures.14  
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to three creditors for approximately 
$47,000. She admits the debts and they are reported on her credit reports.15 During 22 
months of unemployment, Applicant experienced an inability to repay her debts, 
resulting in a history of not paying her debts.16 These concerns are mitigated by the 
circumstances surrounding Applicant’s financial issues. Applicant’s financial problems 
occurred after an event beyond her control, being laid off from the job she held for 17 
years. She does not have a history of financial problems or instability, nor does she 
have a history of financial irresponsibility. Applicant acted responsibly given her limited 
financial resources by actively seeking employment, taking on clients to supplement her 
income, and reducing her expenses.17  
 
Since returning to work, Applicant has made a good-faith effort to reduce her 
indebtedness, paying over $2,700 towards the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR 
in addition to resolving at least three non-SOR accounts.18 Arguing against mitigation,

Applicant’s efforts to pay her delinquent debt could be considered small given the large 
amount of delinquent debt. At her current rate of repayment, it may well take Applicant 
years to satisfy the debts. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board has held that, “an applicant 
is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately 
or simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given her 
circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by 
concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the 
plan.19 Applicant has done so. She has established a track record of payment that she 
can maintain comfortably while rebuilding her savings. 
 
I have no doubts or reservations about Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
have also considered the whole-person factors at AG ¶ 2(a). Applicant’s financial 
problems and resulting delinquent debt are not the result of irresponsible, reckless, or 
negligent behavior. The debt is reasonable given the length of her unemployment, the 
expenses associated with her sister’s care, as well as her own recurring medical issues. 
Applicant has articulated a reasonable plan for dealing with her delinquent debt. Her 
request to occupy a sensitive position is granted.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to assign Applicant to sensitive duties. Eligibility for a public trust position 
granted.
