GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 28, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on July 
31, 2012.2 On September 13, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on September 25, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
September 27, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. On October 24, 2012, Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on 
November 1, 2012. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 30, 2012, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 12, 2012. 
 
 During the hearing, 6 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 6) and 18 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE R) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 27, 2012. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, 
and he submitted five additional exhibits (AE S through AE W) that were admitted into 
evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but six (¶¶ 1.c., 1.f., 1.i., 1.j., 
1.n., and 1.w.) of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations.3 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since October 
2010, has served as an electronic technician. He was previously employed by other 
employers in various positions, including electronic technician, IT specialist, stocker, 
and electrical technician.4 In addition, Applicant served on active duty with the U.S. 
Army from November 2000 until January 2008, when he was honorably discharged with 
a disability and given severance pay.5 He was deployed to Iraq from September 2003 
until April 2004.6 During his period of military service, Applicant was awarded the Army 
Good Conduct Medal (with one oak leaf cluster), the National Defense Service Medal, 
the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Combat

 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence presented 
by deleting five of the factual allegations (&1.k. (a duplicate of &1.b.), &1.p. (a duplicate of &1.h.), as well as &&1.u. 
through and 1.w.). There being no objection, the motion was granted. See, Tr. at 149-154.

Action Badge, and the Parachute Badge.7 He was initially granted a secret security 
clearance in 2001, but it was suspended for unspecified reasons from December 2009 
until March 2010.8 Applicant received an unspecified number of undergraduate credits 
on line, but did not earn a degree.9 He is currently working on a bachelor’s degree in 
business and information systems, and is in his senior year.10 
 
Applicant was married the first time in July 2001, and divorced in March 2008. He 
was married the second time in March 2009. He has four children (a daughter born in 
2001, a son, born in 2002, a daughter born in 2002, and a son born in 2003). 
 
Financial Considerations 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2003. Commencing in 2003, and continuing over the next few years, several events 
occurred that caused him financial problems that made it difficult for him to remain 
current on all of his accounts. Those events included his first wife quitting her job in April 
2006, lowering the family income; having her vehicle damaged with broken axles after 
hitting a pothole;11 the transmission on his automobile needed to be replaced; having to 
purchase another vehicle to get to work and transport the children to school; a lengthy 
period of unresolved military error in calculating his pay and  shorting it for about six 
months; separating from his first wife; eventually getting divorced; moving into 
government quarters and losing his basic housing allowance; loaning an apartment to a 
friend who failed to pay the rent and vacated the apartment, stealing his furniture; 
having his insured automobile stolen from the military facility and damaged; the 
insurance company’s failure and eventual refusal to pay his insurance claim; his ex-
wife’s failure to make the monthly payments on her vehicle (which had the title in his 
name), and having it repossessed; loaning his automobile to a friend who incurred 
parking tickets and failed to pay them in a timely fashion; paying child support; and 
losing his job and being unemployed on two separate occasions during March-July 
2009, and January-April 2010.12 Added to this litany of financial problems was 
Applicant’s lack of financial sophistication. As a result of the above combined situations, 
accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off.  
(SOR & 1.a): Applicant sought guidance from his noncommissioned officer, and 
he was advised to file for bankruptcy.13 He was unaware then that he could have

obtained emergency financial assistance from Army Emergency Relief.14 In October 
2006, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code.15 He listed liabilities totaling $40,541, including $32,702 in liabilities to 
creditors holding secured claims and $7,839 in liabilities to creditors holding unsecured 
nonpriority claims.16 Applicant’s nonpriority, unsecured debts were discharged in 
February 2007.17 Unfortunately for Applicant, continuing and subsequent events 
reestablished financial difficulties, and accounts eventually became delinquent. 
When he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant filed a current income schedule. It 
reflected a net monthly income of $2,331.69.18 On an unspecified date, Applicant 
submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a net monthly income of $5,028.77. 
He claimed $2,062 in monthly expenses, as well as $1,583.28 in mortgage, auto, and 
student loan payments. He had approximately $1,383 left over each month for 
discretionary spending or savings.19  
 
Applicant contacted a variety of creditors and collection agents regarding his 
newer delinquent accounts. In addition to the personal financial management training he 
had received in connection with his previously-filed bankruptcy, Applicant sought the 
assistance of a credit management counselor, and after reviewing his credit report, he 
successfully disputed a number of erroneous entries, resulting in their either being 
deleted from his credit report or corrected.20 He also set up a budget and a repayment 
schedule reflecting anticipated steps in his “credit payoff plan.”21 His plan prioritizes 
accounts, reflects payment start dates, expected payoff dates, and monthly payment 
amounts. Once an account is satisfied, the anticipated payments roll over to other 
identified debts.22 Applicant takes full responsibility for his remaining debts, and 
although he may disagree regarding specific amounts owed, he intends to pay them off 
one bill at a time.23 He has been paying off various smaller accounts, as well as other

accounts that are apparently not listed in the SOR, with the intention of eventually 
addressing the remaining larger accounts.24 
 
The amended SOR identified 18 purportedly continuing delinquencies. Those 
accounts can be categorized into three separate groups: those already paid off and 
resolved, those being paid, and those not yet being paid, but listed for eventual 
repayment. 
  
In the first group, those accounts that were already paid off and resolved, in 
addition to his non-SOR accounts, are his ex-wife’s cell phone account in the disputed 
amount of $1,019 (SOR & 1.e.) that was settled for $713.59, and paid off in August 
2012;25 a credit card account in the disputed amount of $616 (SOR & 1.f.) that was 
settled for $462.35, and paid off in September 2012;26 two student loans in the disputed 
amounts of $1,312 and $2,000 (SOR && 1.i. and 1.j.) that were paid off in February 
2011;27 three parking tickets (incurred by a friend without Applicant’s knowledge), each 
in the amount of $65 (SOR && 1.q. through 1.s.), that were paid off in November 
2012;28 and issuing a worthless check for $500 (SOR & 1.x.) that was actually a 
stopped check initially made to Applicant’s divorce attorney and subsequently paid off. 
As to the check, Applicant’s attorney required an additional $500 to represent him in his 
divorce hearing and Applicant sent him a check. It was not until Applicant’s soon-to-be 
ex-wife called him to advise him the divorce had been dismissed because his attorney 
had failed to appear that Applicant stopped payment on the check and his attorney 
reported it to the authorities. Applicant paid $1,025, including the $500, and the matter 
was resolved.29 
 
In the second group are those accounts that are in the process of being paid, 
including an advanced payment account with the U.S. Government regarding a military 
move in the amount of $969 (SOR & 1.g.) that Applicant has been paying $50 
intermittently since October 2012, and as of December 4, 2012, has already paid $350 
towards the outstanding balance;30 an automobile loan for his ex-wife’s automobile in

the amount of $10,186 (SOR & 1.h.) that she was supposed to pay but failed to do so 
without Applicant’s knowledge, and the vehicle was repossessed and sold at auction, 
that, effective October 2012, is being paid $120 every two weeks by agreement through 
an approved automatic withdrawal from Applicant’s bank account;31 and child support 
arrearage in the disputed amount of $22,430, that one state is enforcing for another 
state (SOR & 1.n.), that Applicant has been paying since his divorce.32 As to the child 
support issue, when the divorce was finalized, Applicant was required to pay $1,478 per 
month for the support and maintenance of three minor children.33 There were times, 
especially when he was periodically unemployed, that he could not afford to do so, but 
once he regained employment, he restarted his payments directly to his ex-wife. 
Unfortunately for Applicant, those direct payments were not included in the state 
calculations, and he was not credited with making them.34 Income tax refunds were 
attached by the state to pay child support, and occasionally his entire paycheck was 
garnished for the same purpose.35 The state has garnished $675.27 of Applicant’s 
wages every two week pay period since October 2010.36 Applicant has attempted to 
resolve the issue and correct the amount demanded, but the state where the children 
reside would not talk to him or give him an accounting since he was not a resident of 
that state, and the state where he resides is unable to talk about the account.37 
 
In the third group, those remaining delinquent accounts are in line to be 
addressed when other accounts, currently being addressed, are resolved, or when he 
has sufficient funds to resolve them earlier. Those accounts include a lease for an 
apartment in the disputed amount of $1,741 (SOR & 1.b.) that Applicant sublet to a 
friend for the remaining four months of the lease with the understanding that she would 
pay the remaining rent. She did not, and was, without Applicant’s knowledge, evicted 
from the apartment.38 The landlord apparently obtained a judgment against Applicant in 
the amount of $734,39 but as of July 2012, a collection attorney is seeking $1,741.40 In

to $1,512 (see, GE 5, supra note 25, at 10).

December 2012, Applicant and the creditor were in the process of discussing a possible 
settlement, but until another debt is resolved, he is unable to commence making 
payments.41  An account related to the lease issue is with a furniture store for furniture 
that was in the apartment, in the amount of $3,077 (SOR & 1.d.).42 That furniture was 
stolen by Applicant’s “friend” when she was evicted from the apartment. Two years 
later, when he encountered her, he noticed she is now unemployed and residing in a 
trailer with no furniture or water, and he has taken no action against her.43 Applicant 
intends to commence monthly $200 repayments in March 2013.44 
 
Applicant had previously financed the purchase of a motor vehicle that he had 
insured with an insurance company and registered on base. About six months later, in 
May 2007, the vehicle was stolen from the military facility. Applicant reported the theft to 
the provost marshal that same day. The vehicle was later found in another city burned 
and considered a total loss.45 Applicant’s enlisted supervisor and a judge advocate 
assisted him with his claim. Although the insurance company initially agreed to cover 
the loss, it eventually refused to do so, without offering Applicant any reasons for its 
decision, except to say that the claim was beyond the statute of limitations.46 Shortly 
thereafter, after he was discharged, Applicant was no longer eligible for judge advocate 
assistance. He furnished the finance company the appropriate paperwork, but did not 
hear from them until 2011, when someone came to his residence to repossess the 
vehicle. Additional submissions were made, but he received no further satisfaction.47 
Instead, the loan was not forgiven by the finance company, and it charged off $5,947 
(SOR & 1.c.).48 Applicant intends to commence monthly $150 repayments in February 
2013.49 
 
Applicant also had a credit union loan for $805 that was charged off (SOR & 
1.l.).50 The SOR also alleges a separate $25 delinquency for the same account (SOR & 
1.m.).51 Applicant contends the two amounts relate to the same account, and that when 
he discussed the account with the creditor, only the balance of $805.81 appeared in

There was a cable account in the amount of $355 that was placed for collection 
(SOR & 1.o.) that Applicant had previously mistakenly thought he had resolved, but he 
had not.54 Applicant intended to pay off the entire balance in December 2012,55 but he 
offered no documentary evidence that he had yet done so. 
 
There is a bank credit card account for $505 that was charged off in 2009 that 
Applicant initially thought was his account, but subsequently denied ownership and 
disputed the account (SOR & 1.t.).56 He contacted the creditor on two occasions; the 
account was listed as a fraud account; and he disputed it with one of the credit reporting 
agencies.57 His request for documentation to confirm the account status has, so far, 
been unsuccessful.58 It should be noted that while the account is listed in Applicant’s 
2009 credit report, it does not appear in either his 2011 or his 2012 credit reports. 
 
Character References  
 
 Applicant’s ex-wife is steadfast in her support for him for while they did not 
remain married, they encountered some situations that were beyond their control, and 
he continued to support their children and her when needed. She has witnessed him go 
from an immature man to the more mature man that he is today. “The man that I see 
today is a very dependable man that would never turn his back on his integrity no matter 
the situation.”59 The information assurance manager for Applicant’s employer has 
characterized Applicant as trustworthy and honest as well as extremely hard working.60

conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”63 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.64  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”65 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”66 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2003, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties, and over the next few years those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted

in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.67 In addition, it is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) when the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies, and AG ¶ 20(c) applies. Applicant’s initial debts were 
discharged in February 2007. Unfortunately for Applicant, continuing and subsequent 
events reestablished financial difficulties, and accounts eventually became delinquent. 
The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing and escalating 
financial difficulties since 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” 
or “was so infrequent.” Applicant consulted with a credit management counselor, set up 
a budget and a repayment schedule, and started following that repayment schedule. He 
prioritized accounts and started his monthly payments. Once an account is satisfied, the 
anticipated payments roll over to other identified debts. Eight of his SOR accounts have 
been resolved, and three are in the process of being resolved through monthly 
payments. Several of his delinquent accounts have not yet been resolved, but they are 
in line awaiting their turn under his repayment plan. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.68 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies. Applicant attributed his financial problems largely to his lack 
of financial sophistication as well as to a variety of circumstances that were largely 
beyond his control. Those circumstances included his first wife quitting her job, lowering 
the family income; having her vehicle damaged with broken axles after hitting a pothole; 
the transmission on his automobile ceasing to function; having to purchase another 
vehicle to get to work and transport the children to school; the lengthy delay in resolving 
                                                          
67
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

a military error in calculating his pay and shorting his pay for about six months; 
separating from his first wife; eventually getting divorced; moving into government 
quarters and losing his basic housing allowance; loaning an apartment to a friend who 
failed to pay the rent and vacated the apartment, and stealing his furniture; having his 
insured automobile stolen from the military facility and damaged; the insurance 
company’s failure and eventual refusal to pay his insurance claim; his ex-wife’s failure to 
make the monthly payments on her vehicle (which had the title in his name), and having 
it repossessed; loaning his automobile to a friend who incurred parking tickets and failed 
to pay them in a timely fashion; paying child support; and losing his job and being 
unemployed on two separate occasions during March-July 2009, and January-April 
2010. Applicant’s indebtedness was not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control. Under the circumstances, Applicant acted responsibly by 
addressing his delinquent accounts rather than avoiding them.69  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies. With the guidance received from the credit management 
counselor, Applicant prioritized his accounts and contacted a variety of collection 
agents. While he was unable to commence making payments simultaneously on all of 
the accounts, Applicant did enter into repayment plans with some creditors. The result 
has been positive. Applicant has resolved several accounts, including some that are in 
the SOR and some that are not, and is in the process of resolving several others. Under 
his repayment plan, he intends to pay his remaining creditors off one bill at a time.  
  
AG ¶ 20(e) applies. After reviewing his credit report, Applicant successfully 
disputed a number of erroneous entries, resulting in their either being deleted from his 
credit report or corrected. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
                                                          
69
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.70       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off. Despite having those delinquent 
accounts discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2007, financial difficulties reappeared 
and new accounts eventually became delinquent. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant sought the assistance of a credit management counselor; successfully 
disputed erroneous accounts and account information; contacted his creditors or 
collection agents; prioritized his delinquent accounts; and he has resolved several 
accounts and is in the process of resolving several others. Under his repayment plan, 
Applicant intends to pay his creditors off one bill at a time. He possesses an excellent 
reputation in the workplace and is a loving and engaged husband and father. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:71 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no

requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue his debt resolution 
efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for 
a security clearance. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
