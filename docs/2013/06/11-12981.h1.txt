LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. There is substantial evidence
establishing a history of financial problems or difficulties, which is likely to recur or
continue. She did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations
security concern. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On January 7, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was
assigned to me on April 11, 2013. The hearing took place by video teleconference as
scheduled on May 16, 2013. The transcript was received on June 3, 2013. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g. She admitted the remaining
allegations under Guideline F, which alleged six delinquent accounts in amounts
ranging from $31 to $7,988 for a total of $14,953. Her admissions are accepted and
adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact
are supported by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has held a
security clearance in conjunction with her employment since 2002. She is seeking to
retain a security clearance for her job as a head service attendant. To that end, she
completed her most recent security clearance application in January 2011.2
There is substantial evidence establishing a history of financial problems or
difficulties,  and these matters are longstanding.  Her initial security clearance3 4
application from 2001 lists a vehicle repossession that occurred in 1999.  Also, she5
entered into a debt-consolidation program in 2001.  It allowed her to agree to a post-6
judgment settlement of an unpaid judgment of about $8,500, which she resolved in
2005. More recently, Applicant’s financial problems fall into three categories: (1)
consumer debt;  (2) medical accounts; and (3) student loans. Those matters are alleged
in the SOR and are discussed below.

The $786 delinquent account in SOR ¶ 1.a is consumer debt and it stems from a
credit card account that went into collection and was then charged off for $1,175.7
Applicant has been repaying it via a repayment agreement with a law firm that is
handling the debt.  The account remains unpaid, but the balance owed was $444 as of8
March 2013.9
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant had another consumer debt in
collection stemming from an account with a mobile-wireless company. The amount in
collection was about $1,367, and she satisfied the account for less than the full balance
in November 2012.  10
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e concern three medical collection accounts for $31,
$487, and $982, respectively. These accounts are now paid.11
There are three delinquent student loan accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, and
1.g, respectively. The first loan had a balance of $4,679 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, but the
balance was $6,273 as of January 2013.  The account is with a collection agency, and12
Applicant has been making $100 monthly payments on the account since February
2013.
The second delinquent student loan had a balance of $7,988 alleged in SOR ¶
1.f and when it went into collection, and that amount is confirmed by a 2011 credit
report.  I cannot determine if it appears on credit reports from 2012 and 2013.  After13 14
the loan defaulted to the guarantor, Applicant completed a payment agreement as
arranged by the guarantor, and the loan was considered rehabilitated.  As of January15
2013, the balance was $7,540, she is making monthly payments of $112 for a
scheduled 109 months, and it has a current status.

Department Counsel conceded the debt is now resolved.16
Applicant attributes falling behind on the student loans due to missing work for a
couple of weeks due to illness in 2009.  At about the same time her daughter became17
unemployed and required financial support. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As18
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt19
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An20
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  21
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting22
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An23
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate24
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme25

 AG ¶ 18.  31

Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.26
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.27
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it28
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant29
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 30
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  31
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.

 There are delinquent debts discussed in the findings of fact that are not alleged in the SOR.  I considered35
these matters for the lim ited purposes of (1) assessing the full extent of Applicant’s adverse financial history,
(2) evaluating her evidence of reform and rehabilitation, and (3) under the whole-person concept (e.g.,
frequency of the conduct).

Applicant’s unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more32 33
than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions. And the same facts support a
conclusion of financial irresponsibility. 
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  Based on the evidence34
before me, none of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to fully mitigate the security
concern. Applicant has a longstanding history of financial problems or difficulties, and it
seems unlikely that history will change any time soon.  Although she has made good35
progress in resolving her current financial problems, she has only recently begun
repaying the two largest and most important of the delinquent debts, which are the
student loans. In total, she now owes nearly $14,000 on the student loans. It is simply
too soon to tell if she will adhere to her agreements and promises to repay the student
loan debts. Given her history, it is just as likely that her financial problems or difficulties
will continue or recur.   36
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and37
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 38
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).39
7
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.38
This is a relatively close case, but based on the available evidence, I am not persuaded
that Applicant has taken enough significant actions to mitigate the security concern
under Guideline F. 
Applicant’s longstanding history of financial problems raises doubt about her
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve the doubt in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the
whole-person concept.  Having done so, I conclude that Applicant did not meet her39
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.f: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
