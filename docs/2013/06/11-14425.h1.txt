O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude Applicant 
has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for financial 
considerations and personal conduct. Her request for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 13, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) that detailed security concerns under Guideline F 
(financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). This action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992) as amended; and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
In her December 7, 2012 Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the 
allegations under Guideline F and Guideline E. The Defense Office of Hearings and 
 
 
 
2 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on May 14, 2013. At the May 30, 2013 
hearing, I admitted five Government exhibits into evidence (GE 1-5). Applicant testified, 
and presented 22 exhibits, admitted into evidence as AE A-V. I held the record open to 
allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted five 
documents. I admitted the documents, without objection, as AE W-AA.1 DOHA received 
the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 11, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and 
the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 51 years old, single, and does not have children. She completed a 
bachelor’s degree in public administration in 1986 and a master’s degree in education in 
2012. She is currently pursuing a doctoral degree. She is certified to teach grades 6 
through 12. She also teaches at the college level when adjunct professor positions are 
available. She planned to begin classes in real estate the week after the hearing. She 
has worked for federal contractors since 2003 in the information technology (IT) field. 
When she completed her security clearance application in August 2010, she was 
employed by a defense contractor as an IT specialist. She is currently “in between 
contracts,” but her security clearance is sponsored by a defense contractor. She has 
held a security clearance for ten years. (GE 1; AE T-V; Tr. 31-32, 79, 139) 
 
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
In 2007,2 Applicant attended a “real estate and wealth” seminar hosted by a 
well-known billionaire real estate developer. She testified, “And that’s when he was 
encouraging everyone that now’s a good time to buy, buy, buy.” (Tr. 32) She testified, 
“. . .  they made it sound very easy because at that time it was very easy to purchase 
with little or no money down.” Applicant decided to become a real estate investor. She 
bought properties with little or no down payments, and “it was very easy to get into.” 
(Tr. 32-34, 143-144) 
 
After Applicant sold one of her homes and realized a profit of about $50,000, 
she began purchasing additional properties. In September 20063, she bought a 
residence for herself for $531,000 (Property B, allegation 1.c). In January 2007, she 
                                                 
1 AE Y is a signed version of the settlement agreement that appears in AE L. 
 
2 Applicant testified that she bought her first investment property in 2008, but her credit reports show that 
most of her mortgage accounts were opened in 2007. (GE 2, 5; AE S) 
 
3 The evidence is unclear as to the purchase date of Property B. Applicant's 2013 credit report shows the 
account was opened in February 2007. However, I will use the date listed in Applicant’s Petition filed 
against Lender B, which states that the property was purchased in September 2006. (AE K, S) 
 
 
 
3 
purchased a studio apartment she stated cost “almost $250,000;”4 (Property A, 
allegation 1.d); and in April 2007, she purchased a condominium in state E for 
approximately $250,000 (Property C, allegations 1.a, 1.b). (GE 2, 5; AE S; Tr. 87-88) 
 
Applicant also bought two other properties that are not alleged under Guideline 
F.5 (GE 2, 5; AE S, Z; Tr. 87-88, 101-103) 
 
• She purchased Property D in January 2007, with a first mortgage of 
$133,520 and a second mortgage of $33,380 from the same lender. Her 
mortgage started to become delinquent in 2010. She was 180 days past 
due as of June 2010. Her August 2010 credit report shows she was 
approximately $7,700 past due, and that foreclosure proceedings had 
been initiated. The property was short-sold. Her 2013 credit report shows 
the status as “paid in settlement.” Applicant provided a form 1099-C 
showing the lender canceled $30,380 in debt related to the second 
mortgage loan. (AE Z) 
• Applicant bought Property E in February 2009 for $406,423. The loan 
was 90 days delinquent in December 2009. As of the date of her August 
2010 credit report, she owed $28,090 in mortgage payments. The 
property was short-sold in October 2010 for $250,000. Her 2013 credit 
report shows that the account was “paid in settlement.” The lender issued 
a form 1099-C indicating that a debt of $173,134 was cancelled on 
October 5, 2010. (AE Z) 
 
After Applicant purchased several properties, the real estate market suffered a 
sharp decline. She had difficulty renting her properties and could not meet her 
mortgage payments. At her August 2010 security interview, Applicant discussed 
delinquent mortgages on Properties B and E. She stated that she could not keep track 
of her payments because she was trying to make payments on two properties. She 
also stated that she could not afford to pay loans on two properties. She sought loan 
modifications from the lenders, and ultimately tried to short-sell her properties. (GE 4; 
Tr. 61, 143) 
 
 Starting in December 2009, Applicant experienced medical problems. In June 
2010, her symptoms were diagnosed with an illness that included debilitating symptoms 
such as significant rapid weight loss. She had difficulty paying her medical bills. She 
                                                 
4 It appears from the evidence that the two mortgage loans totaled $179,000. (AE S) 
 
5 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board 
in ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003). (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive § 6.3.)

testified she could not afford to pay for her health insurance while she was unemployed 
for several months in 2010. The file contains no information on the amount of her 
medical bills, or how they specifically affected her financial resources. (AE K; Tr. 71-75) 
 
 In January 2010, Applicant's employment contract ended. She testified that she 
was unemployed from January to June 2010, but during her security interview she 
stated that she was unemployed from April to July 2010. She spent her time while 
unemployed looking for a job, relaxing, and vacationing. She supported herself with 
savings and unemployment insurance. Although she testified at the hearing that she fell 
behind in her mortgage payments in 2010 because of this unemployment, Applicant 
stated during her security interview that the unemployment did not cause her any 
difficulties. (GE 4; AE K; Tr. 71-72, 139) 
 
 Applicant has not had formal financial counseling. However, she stated at her 
security interview that her realtor counseled her about the properties. In mid-2011, she 
retained a company to assist her in disputing credit report inaccuracies. The company 
informed her that she had 17 negative accounts. Over a period of one year, it disputed 
numerous accounts. (GE 4; AE Q, R; Tr. 75-79) 
 
Applicant submitted her most recent personal financial statement (PFS) in 
response to DOHA interrogatories dated July 2011. Her gross annual income was 
approximately $92,000. Her net monthly income was $5,466. Her monthly expenses, 
including rent of $3,500, totaled $5,000. Her debt payments were $1,050. At that time, 
she had a negative monthly net remainder (MNR) of $584. However, Applicant listed 
her monthly cost for utilities in both the expense ($400) and the debt ($300) sections. 
After correcting this error, Applicant's MNR in 2011 was negative $284. (GE 3) 
 
 Applicant is not presently working. She receives unemployment compensation, 
and supports herself with a “small settlement,” until she accepts one of the job offers 
she has received. One offer is for $92,000 annually. Applicant no longer owns real 
estate, and has no intention of investing in real estate in the future. She lives in a rental 
unit with a roommate and pays $1,500 rent, $2,000 less than in 2011. She works part-
time in public relations when jobs are available. She has two cars, one of which is paid 
off. She purchased the other car in 2009 for $26,600, and the loan is current. She has 
two credit cards, which are also current. (AE S-V; Tr. 59, 139-143) 
 
 Applicant's delinquencies appear in her credit reports dated August 2010, July 
2012, and May 2013. The status of her SOR debts follows. (GE 2, 5; AE S)

MORTGAGE DEBTS 
 
PROPERTY A (allegation 1.d) -– $35,000 (second mortgage); SHORT SALE  
 
 Applicant bought a studio apartment as an investment property in January 
2007.6 She testified that the purchase price was “almost $250,000.” Her 2013 credit 
report shows mortgages with two lenders—a first mortgage of $143,200, and a second 
mortgage of $35,800, for a total debt of $179,000 (AE S; Tr. 60)  
 
 After the renter vacated, Applicant was unable to make her mortgage payments. 
She testified that she became delinquent in fall 2010, but her 2013 credit report shows 
that the second mortgage on her property was 150 days past due in October 2009. 
She testified that the property had lost significant value, and she sought a loan 
modification. At her security interview, she stated she stopped making payments 
because she believed she had to be delinquent in order to qualify for a loan 
modification. The lender denied her request for a modification. The first mortgage 
holder began foreclosure proceedings in November 2010. The original lender sold the 
first mortgage loan to another lender in 2011. That lender continued the foreclosure 
proceedings. Applicant requested to reinstate the loan. She was informed that 
reinstatement would cost $7,816.52. (AE M) Applicant testified that she reinstated the 
loan. (GE 4; AE M, S; Tr. 60-65)  
 
 The house was sold via short-sale on March 29, 2013 for $85,000. The lender 
holding the first mortgage received $73,655. The holder of the second mortgage, cited 
in allegation 1.d, received $3,890, and also provided a letter dated March 11, 2013 
stating that it waived “any possible recourse as to any deficiency on the loan.” (GE 2, 5; 
AE M-O, R, S; Tr. 60-69) 
 
PROPERTY B (allegation 1.c) -– $31,000 (second mortgage)  SETTLED 
  
 Applicant purchased a property in September 2006 for approximately $550,000 
to use as her residence. She obtained an interest-only adjustable-rate loan, which 
allowed her to pay only the interest for the first ten years of the loan. During the real 
estate market decline, it lost about 50% of its value. Applicant received a loan 
modification from Lender A in 2007, which lowered her payments. In 2008, Lender B 
acquired Lender A. The lender granted Applicant a second loan modification in 
September 2009, which again lowered her payments. Shortly after the 2009 
modification, Applicant's loan was pooled with other mortgages into a “collateralized 
mortgage obligation.” Servicing of the loan was transferred to Servicer A. The loan was 
120 days past due as of November 2009, and 150 days past due as of March 2010. 
After Servicer A began handling the loan, Applicant realized a fee of approximately 
$16,000 had been added to her debt because Servicer A was not honoring the 2009 
modification. (AE K, S; Tr. 45-47, 54) 
                                                 
6 Applicant testified that she bought the property in 2009, but her credit report shows that the two loan 
accounts were opened in 2007. (GE 2, 5; AE S, Tr. 63) 
 
 
6 
 In May 2010, Servicer A sent Applicant a Notice of Intent to Foreclose. Applicant 
retained a law firm and on August 20, 2010, the law firm informed Applicant that it had 
received the copy of the foreclosure documents that Applicant had sent, that the 
foreclosure was in process, but the house was not being sold. On October 14, 2010, 
Applicant notified the law firm that Servicer A informed her that the house foreclosed 
on October 8, 2010. The law firm advised Applicant to sue for unlawful foreclosure. (AE 
E, F; Tr. 47-52) 
 
 Applicant decided the law firm was non-responsive and unreliable. She hired 
another law firm in September 2010. In November 2010, Servicer A offered Applicant a 
forbearance agreement against the foreclosure, provided she paid $21,000 to cure her 
arrearages, and $5,500 monthly thereafter. When Applicant complained, Servicer A 
offered her $20,000 for the keys to her property. Applicant paid the $21,000 on 
November 17, 2010, but did not make the $5,500 payment in December 2010. Servicer 
A immediately reinstated foreclosure proceedings, and set the foreclosure sale for 
March 1, 2011. Applicant's law firm filed suit for damages against Servicer A based on 
unfair and deceptive trade practices, citing numerous violations of the state D 
Consumer Protection Act. The petition alleged that Servicer A “ordered the 
commencement of a defective foreclosure action for the purpose of extorting excessive 
and unlawful fees against Plaintiff via the Forbearance Agreement. Using the threat of 
a defectively filed foreclosure, Defendant coerced Plaintiff into paying $21,000 under a 
plan that it knew Plaintiff had no ability to repay.” (AE G, K; Tr. 47-57) 
 
 As of December 31, 2012, Applicant accepted a settlement agreement. Under 
the agreement, Applicant was to vacate the property within 90 days, accept a $20,000 
payment, and provide the lender with the deed in lieu of foreclosure. The settlement 
resolved Applicant's debt, and the lender waived any right to additional fees (AE H-J, L, 
Y; Tr. 57-59) 
 
PROPERTY C (allegations 1.a, 1.b) -– $44,000 past due (on $214,000 first 
mortgage); $38,000 (second mortgage)          SHORT SALE 
 
In 2007, Applicant attended a real estate conference where developers 
encouraged attendees to buy property in their developments. One developer paid for 
Applicant to travel to state E to view a property. It also offered a plan under which it 
would pay Applicant’s mortgage payments for the first three years. In April 2007, 
Applicant paid approximately $250,000 for Property C, a one-bedroom condominium 
located in state E, to use as a rental unit. She financed the property with a first 
mortgage loan of $214,000, and a home equity line/second mortgage (HEL) for 
$38,000.7 After about 18 months, the developer stopped making Applicant's mortgage 
payments, and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection. Applicant's property value 
dropped to approximately $30,000. She could not meet her mortgage payments with 
the rent she was able to charge. In 2010, she received $4,680 in rental income from 
                                                 
7 Applicant testified that the home equity line was the second mortgage on this property. (Tr. 43)

the property. According to Applicant's 2013 credit report, her home equity line/second 
mortgage was 90 days delinquent as of July 2010. (AE S, X, Z; Tr. 34-38, 45) 
 
Applicant retained a law firm. The firm’s October 2011 letter notes that Applicant hired 
it to “. . . assist her in obtaining a loan modification and to defend her in the foreclosure 
action regarding the above subject property.” It also stated that the property was not 
foreclosed “at this time.” The lender did not agree to a loan modification, and began 
foreclosure proceedings in 2012. (AE A-C, S: Tr. 38-40) 
 
 However, the lender ultimately agreed to release the lien securing the property, 
based on a short sale offer of $52,000. As of July 2012, Applicant owed $260,749. On 
March 27, 2013, the property sold for $49,000. The agreement applied $15,011 to the 
first mortgage, and $3,882 to the HEL/second mortgage. (AE B-D; Tr. 40-45) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Allegation 1.e - $1,150, PAID. After Applicant sold one of her properties, the buyer 
filed suit against her in September 2011 to recover a security deposit. Applicant 
testified that she did not receive notice of the suit because she believes she was 
staying at her mother’s home at the time because of her illness. On April 26, 2012, 
Applicant paid $1,271 and satisfied the judgment. (AE P; Tr. 69-71, 131) 
 
COMMUNICATIONS ACCOUNT 
 
Allegation 1.f - $150, UNRESOLVED. Applicant testified that a television satellite 
company mistakenly charged her for unreturned equipment. She testified that her 
credit repair company disputed the debt. Her 2013 credit report shows it has been in 
collection status since January 2011, but it does not show the account is disputed. The 
creditor has informed her that it would settle the account for $75. Applicant did not 
provide evidence of payments or a payment arrangement. (AE S; Tr. 79-80, 131-132)  
 
MEDICAL  
 
Allegations 1.g, 1.h: $253 each, UNRESOLVED. These debts went to collection 
status in September 2011. Applicant testified that they are related to her illness. She 
believes they should have been paid through her medical insurance. She is “80% sure” 
that the two debts are duplicates because the amount of the two debts is the same. 
Applicant's July 2012 credit report shows that one debt was assigned to collection in 
July 2011, and the other was assigned in January 2012; one debt was reported in 
September 2011, and the other in May 2012; the last activity occurred on one debt in 
December 2010, and the other in March 2011, and the debts have two different 
account numbers. However, Applicant's May 2013 credit report lists only one medical 
debt for this amount. Applicant testified that she is “in the process of making payment 
arrangements.” (GE 2; AE S; Tr. 80-82, 97, 132-135) 
 
 
 
8 
CELL PHONE 
 
Allegation 1.i - $406 – UNRESOLVED. Applicant opened a cell phone account in 
2011. It has been delinquent since February 2012, and has been in collection status 
since December 2012. Applicant disputes the amount because the company incorrectly 
applied roaming fees. She testified that she contacted the creditor, and that her credit 
repair company disputed the debt. However, she did not provide documentation 
showing her contacts. Her May 2013 credit report does not show the account is 
disputed. (GE 2, 5; AE S; Tr. 82-83, 135-137, 154-155) 
 
BANK FEES 
 
Allegation 1.j - $51. UNRESOLVED. Applicant’s bank charged her dormant-account 
fees. She testified that the bank is out of business and cannot be reached. Her credit 
report shows that the debt has been in collection status since May 2012. Applicant 
testified that she is “probably just going to have to pay it.” She intended to pay it the 
week after the hearing, and was provided with an opportunity to submit evidence of 
payment. After the hearing, Applicant forwarded a June 13, 2013 letter from the 
creditor showing the debt is in dispute. (GE 2; AE S, AA; Tr. 85-86, 92, 155-156) 
 
STUDENT LOAN 
 
Allegation 1.k - $1,734 – DEFERRED. Applicant financed her education using student 
loans. Her May 2013 credit report shows the most recent balance as $89,312.  She is 
currently enrolled in a doctoral program, and her loans are deferred. Her credit reports 
confirm her deferred status. (GE 2, 5; AE S; Tr. 83-85, 94-95) 
 
PERSONAL CONDUCT 
 
 When Applicant completed her security clearance application in August 2010, 
the financial section asked whether, within the previous seven years, she had any 
foreclosures, any debts that were either 180 days past due, or currently 90 days past 
due. Applicant answered “No” to all of the financial questions, except the one 
concerning debts that were currently 90 days past due. In response to that question, 
she disclosed the following: a mortgage of $250,000 that was “pending mitigation for 
modification” (Property C, allegations 1.a and 1.b), and a loan for $400,000 that she 
noted was “approved for short sale.” (Property E, not alleged in the SOR). She did not 
disclose that the Property B loan was 150 days delinquent as of March 2010; that she 
received a notice of intent to foreclose on Property B in May 2010; that the Property D 
loan was 90 days past due as of March 2010; or that foreclosure proceedings had 
been initiated on Property D. (GE 1, 5; AE S) 
 
 Applicant testified that she did not list all her property loans because she 
thought the questions on the application concerned only properties that she “was 
having financial issues with.” She disclosed Property C because it was not yet 
 
 
9 
resolved. She did not disclose Property D because it was about to go to short sale, and 
she considered it sufficiently resolved so that it was not a “financial issue.” However, 
she did disclose Property E, which was also about to proceed to short sale at that time. 
She testified she did not disclose Property B because the law firm she hired told her it 
would work out a loan modification, so she did not believe that Property B was a 
“financial issue.” Applicant also testified that she had not seen her credit report when 
she completed her security clearance application. (Tr. 97-106) 
 
 At her September 2010 security interview, Applicant stated she did not disclose 
her financial delinquencies on her application because she thought all of her 
delinquencies would be resolved by the time she was interviewed. At the hearing, she 
said she did not list all of her debts because she was rushed to complete the 
application while at work and her manager and co-workers would not help her with the 
application. (GE 4; Tr. 97-106) 
 
 At her 2010 security interview, Applicant discussed Properties B and E. She 
said Property B was not in collection status because she was working with the lender. 
Later in the interview, the agent asked Applicant about the properties that she had not 
disclosed earlier in the interview--Properties A and D. In each case, Applicant stated 
she had stopped making payments because she was trying to obtain either a loan 
modification or a short sale. (GE 4) 
 
Policies 
 
Each security clearance decision must be a fair and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, 
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.8 Decisions 
must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, 
commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept.  The presence or absence of a 
disqualifying or mitigating condition does not determine a conclusion for or against an 
applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines are followed whenever a case can 
be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or 
denial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the 
information presented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and 
adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations) and 
Guideline E (personal conduct).   
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest9 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial 
burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government 
                                                 
8 Directive. 6.3. 
9 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
 
 
10 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets 
its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government’s 
case. Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy 
burden of persuasion.10 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, 
the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national 
interests as her or his own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in 
favor of the Government.11 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially over-
extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . 
 
 Applicant's debts stem primarily from her real estate investments. The SOR 
alleges delinquent loans on three properties that she purchased between 2006 and 
2007 when the real estate values were climbing. Within a short period of about six 
months, Applicant assumed more than $1,000,000 in mortgage loans. When the 
market crashed and her rental properties were vacant, she could not meet the 
mortgage payments. However, I conclude that, as to Property B, Applicant was the 
victim of a mortgage servicer who engaged in fraudulent and unfair business practices. 
I find for Applicant as to that loan. The following disqualifying conditions apply under 
AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.

 The Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate 
security concerns. I have considered the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 20, especially 
the following: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant's debts are both numerous and recent. Two properties were sold only 
three months before the hearing through short sales. Of the small non-mortgage debts, 
two are resolved (allegations 1.e and 1.f) but the remaining five are not. As to 
recurrence, the housing crash and Applicant’s real estate ventures are unlikely to 
recur. However, her response to the housing bubble that preceded the crash is 
troubling. She overextended herself by buying multiple properties, within a short period, 
with little or no money down. Although the record does not include specific information 
on her income in 2007, her income was $92,000 in 2011, and likely less in the period of 
2006 to 2007, when she was investing heavily in real estate. She admitted during her 
security interview that she could not afford to pay for even two properties 
simultaneously. Applicant's conduct shows a lack of good judgment, and a willingness 
to engage in financially risky behavior. AG 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) concerns unforeseeable events that affect an applicant's ability to 
meet her financial obligations. Applicant was obviously affected by the depressed 
housing market, which made her properties difficult to rent or sell. Applicant could not 
predict or control this event, and it had a negative effect on her ability to pay her debts. 
She made efforts to resolve her property debts by seeking loan modifications and short 
sales from the lenders. Applicant was also diagnosed with a medical condition in 2010, 
which apparently affected her ability to handle her properties. She was unemployed in 
2010, which was also beyond her control. However, she was unemployed for only a 
 
 
12 
few months, and told the agent at her security interview that it did not cause her any 
difficulties. For full application of this mitigating condition, an applicant must act 
responsibly in relation to the unforeseen circumstance. She hired a law firm in 
September 2010, to assist with the Property B loan. She did not hire a firm to dispute 
debts on her credit report until mid-2011. Other than these actions, Applicant sought 
loan modifications or short sales for her delinquent properties for several years 
between 2009 and 2013. AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part.  
 
 Applicant did not seek formal financial counseling. She tried to resolve her 
mortgage debts by obtaining loan modifications or short sales. Foreclosure was 
initiated on Property A in 2010 and Property C in 2012. Both properties eventually 
short-sold in 2013, about two months before the hearing. It appears from the evidence 
that Applicant has taken no definitive action to pay or set up payment plans for five of 
the smaller debts in the SOR. They have been delinquent or in collection status since 
2011-2012. Applicant receives partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c). 
 
 Applicant retained a law firm and filed suit against Servicer A because of its 
unfair lending practices in regard to Property B. It appears from the evidence that 
Applicant's challenge was legitimate. The dispute is settled and the debt resolved. She 
also retained a firm to dispute other debts on her credit report in 2011. However, two of 
the non-mortgage SOR debts Applicant said she disputed are not listed in her 2012 or 
2013 credit reports as disputed. Applicant did not dispute one of the SOR debts until 
after the hearing. She provided no documentation to show the basis for her belief that 
her debts were not valid. Applicant receives mitigation as to Property B under AG ¶ 
20(e), but not as to her remaining debts. 
 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
 
 AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to 
provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance 
process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance 
process. 
 
The Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying condition under 
AG ¶ 16: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts 
from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
 
 
13 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
 The Government alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose all of her 
financial delinquencies on her 2010 security clearance application. She reported 
delinquent mortgage loans on two properties, but failed to report loans related to three 
other properties that were delinquent at the time. Applicant's statement on her 
application that she had only two properties, which were about to be resolved, 
presented a misleading picture of her financial status. She stated during her security 
interview that she did not list all of her debts because she thought they would be 
resolved by the time she had her security interview, indicating that she consciously 
decided not to reveal all of her mortgage delinquencies when she completed her 
application. AG ¶ 16(a) applies. 
 
The following mitigation conditions are relevant: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior 
is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
There is no evidence that Applicant informed any authorized government official 
that she wished to correct the answers on her security clearance application. 
Applicant's failure to be forthright with the government during a security clearance 
investigation cannot be considered minor. In addition, I cannot conclude that such 
conduct will not recur, because after failing to be forthright on her application, Applicant 
continued to state at the hearing that she failed to disclose all of her delinquent debts in 
2010 because she thought all but two properties were resolved. Applicant's conduct 
casts doubt on her trustworthiness and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 17(a) and (c) cannot be 
applied. 
 
Whole-Person Analysis   
  
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and all 
the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
 
14 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited 
guidelines, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of 
all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  
 
 Applicant is an intelligent, educated woman who has succeeded in several 
fields. However, during the housing bubble, she succumbed to high-pressure sales 
tactics at a real estate seminar, and followed a celebrity investor’s advice to “buy, buy, 
buy.” She engaged in risky financial behavior by obtaining loans on several properties 
over a short period in 2006-2007, with little or no money down. She became indebted 
for more than $1,000,000. When the housing market crashed, she did not have 
sufficient funds to cover her vacant rental units, and her loans became delinquent. In 
2009, Applicant bought another property for more than $400,000, despite her existing 
high mortgage debt. Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on several properties.  
 
 Applicant was not candid about the true state of her financial affairs when she 
completed her 2010 security clearance application. It also appears from the 
investigative agent’s summary of her security interview that she did not disclose 
several of her mortgage loans until after the agent confronted her with the details 
discovered during the investigation.  
 
 The record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant’s 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concerns raised by the cited adjudicative guideline.
