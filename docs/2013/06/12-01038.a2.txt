APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
15, 2012, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On January 29, 2013, after considering the record, Defense Office of
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant’s request for
a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  On March
22, 2013, we remanded the case to the Judge for a new Decision.  The Judge issued the new
Decision on March 29, 2013.  Applicant again appealed in accordance with the Directive.
Applicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge’s findings were supported
by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred by considering conduct not alleged in the
SOR; whether the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence; and whether the Judge’s adverse
decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  
The Judge’s Findings
The Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant
is a construction specialist working for a Defense contractor.  From 1995 to 2006 he ran his own
company.  
In the early 2000s, Applicant’s company had a disagreement with a customer over the scope
of work to be performed under a contract as well as over payments, including a $285,000 “draw”
needed to finance labor and equipment.  Applicant sued the customer, but the settlement of $171,000
was not sufficient to cover his bills, especially after deducting his lawyer’s fee.  As a consequence,
he was unable to obtain performance and payment bonds for his company, which limited his ability
to secure construction contracts.  From 2005 to 2006, he received inadequate payments, causing him
to fall behind on taxes.  
Applicant has experienced unemployment during the past few years, and his annual income
dropped dramatically in 2007 through 2009, although his wages in 2010 exceeded $136,000.  He
has also performed work on construction jobs overseas in support of U.S. military operations.  
Applicant owed money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for delinquent federal taxes.
The two SOR allegations addressing this liability assert debts of $14,891 and $4,231.  Although
Applicant claimed to have been making payments to the IRS, there is no record evidence of
payments after February 1, 2012.  In addition, the record contains evidence of a debt owed by
Applicant’s corporation to the IRS in the amount of $145,000 due to insufficient quarterly tax
payments.  Although Applicant contended that this debt had been reduced and was included in the
two debts alleged in the SOR, the Judge found that it was separate from them.  This debt was not
alleged as a security concern.
In addition, Applicant has a has a mortgage account that is delinquent in the amount of
$4,082.  He purchased the home in 1984 for $80,000, but he borrowed additional funds.  In 2010,
he applied for a loan modification.  From December 2009 until November 2010, he accrued a total
delinquency of over $26,000.  The lender approved the modification, and Applicant was current
through November 2011.  However, in December 2011 he applied for another loan modification,
which was approved a year later.  The record does not show the amount of the mortgage or of his
new mortgage payment.  
In December 2012, the creditor agreed to suspend foreclosure proceedings if Applicant made
payments of $1,802 a month for the following three months.  The record contains evidence of a
payment in January 2013. 
 
The Judge’s Analysis
Although he cleared Applicant on some of the SOR allegations, the Judge concluded that
Applicant had not mitigated concerns arising from his IRS tax debt and his delinquent mortgage
account.  He noted that Applicant had not demonstrated payments to the IRS after February 2012,
despite his having been employed since that time.  He stated that Applicant had not made payments
on his mortgage for most of 2010, although his income was apparently sufficient to have enabled
him to do so.  
The Judge concluded that Applicant’s payments under his most recent loan modification
constituted an insufficient track record to show responsible action in regard to his debts.  The Judge
stated that Applicant had not presented evidence of continuous contact with his creditors.  He stated
that Applicant’s income during the previous several years was such that he should have been able
to have made more than “minimal” progress toward debt resolution.  
Discussion
Applicant challenges the Judge’s statement that he had not made payments on his mortgage
throughout most of 2010.  We note evidence that, during 2010, Applicant accrued a mortgage
delinquency of over $26,000, which is consistent with the challenged statement.  Even if the Judge
had not made the statement, there is no reason to believe that the outcome of the case would have
been different.  The Judge’s  material findings of security concern are supported by substantial
record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-
10633 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2013).  
Applicant cites to evidence he submitted after the hearing, as well as to his contention that
he was making payments on his Federal tax debts and evidence regarding his most recent loan
modification.  The Judge discussed the evidence that Applicant has cited.  He noted that some of
Applicant’s claims of repayment were not corroborated, which is consistent with the record before
him.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the
record nor has he demonstrated that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
11-03302 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2013).  
Applicant challenges the Judge’s treatment of the $145,000 debt, arguing that it was not
alleged in the SOR and does not establish security concerns.  However, conduct not alleged in a
SOR may be considered for a number of reasons, including evaluating an applicant’s case for
mitigation or rehabilitation, his credibility, or the whole-person factors.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
10-03430 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2011).  The Judge’s explicitly stated that he was considering this
debt for these purposes.  Decision at 3-4, note 5.     
Despite Applicant’s arguments to the contrary, the Judge examined the relevant data and
articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.
“The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See
also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
