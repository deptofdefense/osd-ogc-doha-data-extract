Tuider, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges nine delinquent debts, totaling 
$24,808. Applicant’s spouse had unexpected medical expenses, and he had periods of 
unemployment. He paid three SOR debts, and his remaining SOR debts are in a 
payment plan. He paid over $4,000 to address his SOR debts in the previous 12 
months. Financial considerations are mitigated. He did not provide accurate and 
complete financial information on his security clearance application; however, when he 
submitted it, he disclosed the financial information was incomplete and he disclosed 
unrelated derogatory information on his SF 86. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 10, 2010, Applicant submitted an SF 86 (GE 1). On December 27, 
2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for 
a determination whether his clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On January 17, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR. On March 27, 2013, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 2, 2013, DOHA assigned 
Applicant’s case to me. On April 3, 2013, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for April 25, 2013. Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant offered seven exhibits. (Tr. 17-20; GE 1-5; 
AE A-G) There were no objections to my consideration of any of the documents, and 
they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 19-20) On May 3, 2013, DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing. After the hearing, Applicant submitted 13 exhibits, which were 
admitted without objection. (AE H-T) The record was closed on May 14, 2013. (Tr. 70)      
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant accepted responsibility for the debts listed in 
the SOR. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.i) He also explained what he had done and was doing to 
resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his security 
clearance application. (SOR ¶ 2.c) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old network systems engineer for a defense contractor. 
(Tr. 21-24; GE 1) He has worked for his current employer since December 2012. (Tr. 
21) He held a security clearance from 1999 to 2005. (Tr. 21) His secret clearance was 
renewed on December 11, 2012. (Tr. 23) He graduated from high school in 1984, and 
he has about 20 college credits. (Tr. 24) He has never served in the military. (SF 86) 
 
Applicant was divorced in October 2009. (Tr. 25) His children are ages 14, 16, 
and 20. (Tr. 24) His children live with his former spouse. (Tr. 24) His monthly child 
support payment was reduced from $1,400 to $1,100. (Tr. 24) He was unemployed for 
six months in 2010, and for four months in 2012. (Tr. 25) He has a child support 
arrearage of about $6,000. (Tr. 58) He is making $125 monthly payments to reduce the 
arrearage. (Tr. 58) As part of the divorce agreement, he accepted responsibility for the 
marital credit card debts. (Tr. 59) His former spouse received the house, a truck, and 
responsibility for the lien on the truck and mortgage on the house. (Tr. 59-60)   
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $79,000. (Tr. 25) In June 2010, he remarried. (SF 86) 
His spouse is disabled and has not been employed outside their home since January 
2011. (Tr. 25-26, 42) She has applied for Social Security disability. (Tr. 26) One of his 
wife’s children was living with Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 43) Her former spouse 
pays Applicant and his spouse $900 monthly in child support. (Tr. 43) 
 
In March 1987, Applicant was in a vehicle accident and broke his neck. (Tr. 36) 
The insurance company paid him an initial $12,000 payment; every five years he 
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
received $10,000; $20,000; $30,000; and in July 2007, he received a final payment of 
$135,000. (Tr. 37) He used the settlement payments to pay his delinquent debts. (Tr. 
37) Some of the final settlement was spent frivolously. He used $40,000 from the final 
payment to purchase a boat and about $5,000 for vacations. (Tr. 63-64) None of the 
final payment was saved, and he admitted he was immature about how he handled the 
settlement money. (Tr. 64) In 2011, he sold the boat for $22,000. (Tr. 64) He used the 
$22,000 to pay some debts. (Tr. 64) 
 
In 1996, he purchased a house for $165,000. (Tr. 38) Applicant turned the house 
over to his spouse during the divorce. (Tr. 41) In 2010, the house was foreclosed 
because of Applicant’s unemployment. (Tr. 39-40) He did not know whether the creditor 
sold the property or there was a deficiency. (Tr. 41)  
 
Applicant provided the following information on his nine SOR debts: 
 
1.a. Applicant owed a landlord $273 for unpaid rent. (Tr. 44-46) He moved out of 
the apartment in 2011. (Tr. 45) About a year ago, he asked the landlord to explain the 
debt; however, the landlord did not provide the necessary details. (Tr. 46) The landlord 
was unwilling to reduce the amount of the debt. (Tr. 45-46) On May 8, 2013, he paid the 
debt. (AE T) 
 
1.b. Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that 
he had a payment arrangement with the creditor; he owed $4,980 on a credit card debt 
from his previous marriage; and he was making $67 monthly payments. (Tr. 47) He said 
he made six or seven payments. (Tr. 47-48, 57)    
 
1.c and 1.d. Applicant had medical debts for $50 and $133. (Tr. 49) Applicant 
erroneously thought he paid the $50 debt, and his former spouse said she paid the 
$133 debt. (Tr. 49-50) On May 6, 2013, he paid the two debts. (AE I, J, R, S) 
 
1.e. Applicant told an OPM investigator that he had a payment arrangement with 
the creditor; he owed $1,582 on a credit card debt; and he said he was making $60 
monthly payments. (Tr. 50, 57) He made 12 payments in 2009-2010; however, he 
stopped making payments when he was out of work. (Tr. 50)  
 
1.f. Applicant admitted the debt in his SOR response. (Tr. 52) At his hearing, he 
said he was unaware of the basis for the collection debt for $1,000. (Tr. 51-52) His 
credit report indicates the account was opened in 1991 and was a joint revolving 
account. (Tr. 51)    
 
1.g. Applicant told an OPM investigator that he planned to arrange a payment 
plan with the creditor; he owed $5,730 on a credit card debt; and for the last month he 
had been communicating with the creditor about starting a $50 monthly payment plan. 
(Tr. 53)  
 
1.h. The SOR indicates the amount of the collection debt is $9,229. On 
September 29, 2011, the creditor obtained a judgment for $8,672. (AE G) He currently

owes the creditor $6,722; the creditor is garnishing 25% of his pay; and four $574 
payments were garnished over a two month period. (Tr. 53-54, 55, 57-58) The creditor 
offered to lift the garnishment, and Applicant promised to pay the creditor $274 monthly, 
using a credit counseling service (CCS). (AE H, L, N, O)    
 
1.i. He owes the creditor $1,813, and he said he could not afford to make any 
payments. (Tr. 57)     
 
At the time of his hearing, Applicant had not had financial counseling; however, 
his spouse is able to manage their finances. (Tr. 60) They have an 18-month plan to 
pay all of their debts. (Tr. 65) Their plan is not in written form. (Tr. 66) Applicant is 
current on his federal and state income taxes. (Tr. 61) He received a $2,800 federal 
income tax refund in 2013, and he used $1,900 to pay down his child support arrearage 
and part to address a delinquent utility debt. (Tr. 62) Because of the garnishment, 
Applicant’s expenses exceed his income every month by $500 to $600. (Tr. 66-67) 
 
I asked Applicant to provide a written budget, to provide proof of financial 
counseling, and documentation showing status and resolution for each SOR debt. (Tr. 
70-71) After his hearing, he provided 13 exhibits. (AE H-T) His budget showed he had 
$182 left after paying his debts and expenses. (AE L) His budget assumes the 
garnishment is released. (AE H, L, M) He also provided proof that he paid the three 
debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. (AE R-T) 
 
On May 8, 2013, Applicant opened an account with a credit counseling service 
(CCS), and he paid CCS $743. (AE M) CCS is scheduled to address six debts, 
including the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, and 1.e-1.i. (AE M, Q) His monthly payment to CCS 
is $743. (AE L, M) All of his debts are either paid or in a payment plan.     
  
Personal Conduct 
 
Section 26 of Applicant’s December 10, 2010 SF 86 asks whether he has debts 
currently delinquent over 90 days or delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years. 
(GE 1) He answered, “no” to these two questions. (Tr. 28; GE 1) He was rushed by his 
Human Resources office, and they did not give him sufficient time to collect the 
necessary information to fully complete his SF 86. (Tr. 28) He needed to go home to get 
the negative financial information; however, he did not believe he had time to leave his 
work place. (Tr. 31) He told Human Resources that he needed more time to collect 
information, and he was still told to submit his SF 86 by close of business. (Tr. 29)  
 
Applicant gave the same explanation about failing to disclose complete financial 
information, that he was rushed to complete his SF 86, when an OPM investigator 
interviewed him on January 21, 2011. (Tr. 29; GE 2) He knew when he submitted his SF 
86 that if he submitted his derogatory financial information “it would jeopardize [his] 
employment, [or] it could possibly jeopardize [his] employment with [his] employer.” (Tr. 
31) When he sent in his SF 86, he told the Human Resources person that he needed to 
update his SF 86 with correct data. (Tr. 32-33)  
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant disclosed on his December 10, 2010 SF 86 that he was terminated 
from a previous employment for conflict of interest and taking excessive lunch breaks. 
At his hearing, he verified that he was fired from his employment with a car dealership 
for these reasons. (Tr. 41-42) The conflict of interest related to operating a private 
business. (Tr. 41-42) 
 
Character evidence 
 
Five of Applicant’s friends have known him for many years both personally and 
professionally as well as through church and their neighborhood. (AE A-C, E-F) His 
supervisor also provided a very positive description of Applicant. (AE D) They describe 
him as honest, reliable, responsible, conscientious, diligent, helpful, intelligent, creative, 
energetic, and courteous. (AE A-F)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM interview, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s debts became delinquent several years ago. His SOR alleges nine 
delinquent debts, totaling $24,808. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Unexpected medical bills, divorce, unemployment, and insufficient income to 
support his family and pay his child support caused Applicant to have debts he could 
not afford to pay. His financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond 
his control. He paid three SOR debts, and his remaining SOR debts are in a payment 
plan. He paid over $4,000 to address his SOR debts in the previous 12 months.1  
 
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the applicant had $41,000 in delinquent 
                                            
1
 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. 
Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge 
issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently 
divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her 
former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child support to her. The Appeal 
Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that 
applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was 
issued. The Appeal Board also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability 
of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence2 of irresponsible behavior, poor 
judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay her creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before he has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Partial application of AG ¶ 20(c) is warranted. Applicant received some financial 
counseling, and he generated a budget. Although there is limited evidence of record 
that he established and maintained contact with his creditors,3 his financial problem is

 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a

being resolved or is under control. When he became employed and received his federal 
income tax refund, he paid down his delinquent child support. He paid three debts and 
started a payment plan to resolve his remaining SOR debts.    
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith.4 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not dispute any of his delinquent SOR 
debts.    
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts primarily because of insufficient 
income, his unemployment, divorce, his spouse’s disability and her unemployment, and 
to a lesser extent because of medical debts. He paid three of nine SOR debts. He made 
numerous debt payments and has established payment plans on all of his SOR debts. 
Applicant has a sufficient monthly remainder as shown by his PFS and budget to 
maintain his financial responsibility. It is unlikely that financial problems will recur. His 
efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
Assuming, financial considerations concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security 
concerns are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. 
  
                                                                                                                                            
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
One personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 16 is potentially 
applicable. This disqualifying condition provides:   
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.5 
  
AG ¶ 16(a) applies. The Government produced substantial evidence that 
Applicant’s answers were incorrect when he responded to Section 26 of his December 
10, 2010 SF 86, which asks about his debts currently delinquent over 90 days or 
delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years. He answered, “no” to these two 
questions. He did not disclose that he has several debts that were currently delinquent 
for more than 180 days. Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating 
conditions is required.    
 
AG ¶¶ 17(a) and 17(f), “the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts” and 
“the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability” are 
applicable. When Applicant submitted his SF 86, he was rushed, and he told Human 
Relations that it was incomplete. He did not have sufficient time to research and list his 
delinquent debts. His incomplete SF 86 should have been rejected. When he had his 
                                            
5
The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.

OPM interview six weeks after he completed his SF 86, he disclosed his delinquent 
debt. He did not have the intent to conceal his financial problems. He disclosed 
unrelated derogatory information on his SF 86 that he was terminated from previous 
employment for misconduct. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under Guidelines F and E, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old network systems engineer, who has worked for his 
current employer, a defense contractor, since December 2012. He held a security 
clearance from 1999 to 2005, and there are no allegations of security violations. He 
graduated from high school in 1984, and he has about 20 college credits. In June 2010, 
he remarried. His spouse is disabled and has not been employed outside their home 
since January 2011. She has applied for Social Security disability. He is sufficiently 
mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. There is every 
indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. Medical expenses, 
divorce, and underemployment contributed to his financial woes. I give Applicant 
substantial credit for admitting responsibility for his delinquent debts in his January 21, 
2011 OPM personal subject interview, responses to DOHA interrogatories, SOR 
response, and at his hearing. He received a strong endorsement from his supervisor 
and five character references from a neighbor and friends, who have known him many 
years. He has the financial resources to pay his debts.  
 
Even though he lacked financial resources because of his spouse’s disability, 
divorce, and periodic unemployment, Applicant made numerous payments to address 
his child support debt, and he paid over $4,000 in the last 12 months to address his 
delinquent debts. He paid three SOR debts, and he placed his remaining six SOR debts 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
into a payment plan. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-
person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands how to budget and what 
he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. Taking into account 
all of the evidence, Applicant appears trustworthy. He established a “meaningful track 
record” of debt repayment and he recognizes the importance of maintaining financial 
responsibility.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
and personal concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information 
is granted. 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
