GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 20, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On October 26, 2012, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
December 18, 2012.2 On December 28, 2012, the DOD issued him a set of e-mail 
interrogatories. He responded to the e-mail interrogatories on January 14, 2013.3 On 
February 11, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February

20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 
1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on February 19, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
March 8, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on April 23, 2013. The case was assigned to me on April 25, 2013. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 7, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on June 3, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 6) and eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE H) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 12, 2013. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. 
He submitted eight additional documents, which were marked as exhibits (AE I through 
AE P) that were admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 
12, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with an explanation, all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since March 
2011, has served as a full-time electrical systems engineer, and, since November 2010, 
has served as a part-time organizer and member of his own limited liability company 
(LLC).4 He was previously employed by other employers in various positions, including 
bank teller, sales associate, car salesman, quality assurance specialist, consumer 
solutions representative, and electrical engineer.5 Applicant has been unemployed on 
several occasions for varying periods. He has never served with the U.S. military.6 He

has held a secret security clearance since 2008, and is now an applicant for a top 
secret clearance.7 Applicant attended a combination of community college, university, 
and on-live courses, and received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in May 
2001, and a master’s degree in organizational leadership in 2009.8 He has never been 
married.9 Applicant has two sons, born in 1999 and 2006.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
Although Applicant contends that there was nothing unusual about his finances 
until about 2010, it appears that he was experiencing some financial difficulties as early 
as 2005 when one account became delinquent on three separate occasions.11 Other 
accounts also became delinquent in 2007 and 2008.12 In 2009, as a first-time home 
buyer, Applicant purchased a residence with $3,000 down plus financing for a total of 
$171,000.13 He had a fixed rate mortgage, and his monthly payments were initially 
$1,280, but in late 2010, because of increased taxes, they increased to $1,500.14 
Applicant’s father was diagnosed with throat cancer in June of 2010. Through 2011, his 
father underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. His father’s health struggles 
prompted Applicant to move from where Applicant worked and resided to where his 
father resided. Applicant moved in with his father to furnish assistance and finances.15 
The combination of considerable relocation expenses, increased mortgage payments, 
the lack of a renter, his father’s limited ability to work, and the financial assistance 
Applicant expended on behalf of his father, was overwhelming and resulted in a 
shortage of available funds, and an inability to maintain his various monthly payments.16 
As a result, accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or 
charged off.  
In July 2012, Applicant hired a law firm to assist him in his efforts to prevent a 
mortgage foreclosure and to facilitate a short sale.17 In August 2012, he engaged the 
services of another law firm to review his accounts and determine consolidation and 
repayment strategies. Two months later, he decided he did not need their assistance for

he could accomplish the same result by himself.18 He contacted his creditors and 
collection agents regarding his delinquent accounts, and tried to work out repayment 
arrangements. He settled some accounts and paid off others.19 He spoke with his 
mortgage holder and explored mortgage modifications and short sales, but nothing 
worked to his satisfaction.20 On January 29, 2013, nearly two weeks before the SOR 
was issued, Applicant finally rented his residence for $1,175 per month.21  
In response to the DOD interrogatories, in December 2012, Applicant provided a 
personal financial statement reflecting a monthly net salary of $6,185.68; monthly 
household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $2,098; and monthly debt 
repayments of $2,207.77; leaving a monthly remainder of $1,879.01 available for 
discretionary savings or expenditures.22  
The SOR identified three purportedly continuing delinquencies. There is a credit 
union credit card account with a high credit of $3,000 and an unpaid balance of $3,438, 
of which $393 was past due (SOR & 1.a.).23 The amount past due eventually increased 
to $186.24 Applicant contended that he called the creditor and learned that the 
remaining balance was $367.25 He made an initial payment of $55 in December 2012,26  
and a second payment of $367 in February 2013.27 According to the creditor, 
Applicant’s current balance has been reduced to $2,722.23, and the account is no 
longer past due.28 The account has been resolved. 
  
There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $651 and a balance of $541 
that was current but previously past due (SOR & 1.b.).29 The account was transferred or 
sold to a debt buyer. The high credit was raised to $740 and the past due balance was 
increased to $555.30 Applicant and the credit agent agreed to a repayment plan, and

commencing November 2, 2012, Applicant made preauthorized biweekly payments of 
$61.62.31 He made his last and final payment of $244.55 on February 26, 2013, and 
there is now a zero balance.32 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a home mortgage account with a high credit of $171,260 and an unpaid 
balance of $168,555, of which $4,695 was 90 days past due (SOR & 1.c.).33 Applicant 
was unable to continue making his monthly payments on time, and by mid-June 2011, 
he was about 90 days past due.34 He made some increased payments in order to 
reduce his delinquency status to 60 days past due.35 In February 2012, the bank 
account relations manager and a realtor advised him of his options. Following their 
guidance, he commenced the home payment modification process, otherwise referred 
to as the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and withheld monthly 
payments during the review process. Entry into HAMP was denied in June 2012, 
leaving Applicant with a larger delinquency.36 The foreclosure process started.37  
 
Applicant offered the house for short sales, but the two offers he received were 
rejected as being too low. His strategy changed from short sale to restoring the 
mortgage balance. On November 27, 2012, a reinstatement calculation was issued by 
the mortgage lender.38 Applicant was required to make 3 monthly payments of 
$1,565.15, and 14 monthly payments of $1,459.25, for a total of $20,747.20 (waiving 
certain fees).39 Another reinstatement calculation was issued on February 26, 2013, 
with an increased total payment of $25,124.95.40  
 
In February 2013, the mortgage loan was sold or transferred for servicing to 
another company.41 As of April 2013, the total amount due, including monthly payments, 
default costs, unpaid late charges, and past-due payments, was $30,670.12.42 A final 
reinstatement quote was issued in May 2013, reflecting a total amount due of

$29,371.46.43 With the money from his income tax refund and other available financial 
resources, Applicant anticipates resolving the deficiency by June 15, 2013.44 Applicant’s 
account was placed into a pay plan under which 50 percent of his mortgage payment is 
automatically deducted from his account two times per month.45 The account is in the 
process of being resolved, or conceivably already might have been resolved. 
 
Although Applicant has never received “traditional” financial counseling,46 he has 
received financial counseling and guidance from two law firms. He has no other 
delinquent debts.47 On May 1, 2013, Applicant, on behalf of his LLC, and an investor 
agreed that the investor would make an investment of $15,000 to the LLC within 30 
days.48 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2010, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties. Over the next few years, those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or sold. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.55  
                                                          
55
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
9 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2010 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. His father’s health struggles prompted Applicant to move to where 
his father resided so that he could furnish assistance and finances. However, the 
combination of considerable relocation expenses, increased mortgage payments, the 
lack of a renter for his house, his father’s limited ability to work, and the financial 
assistance Applicant expended on behalf of his father, was overwhelming and resulted 
in a shortage of available funds, and an inability to maintain his various monthly 
payments. Accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or 
charged off.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts.56 While he 
never received “traditional” financial counseling, he hired one law firm to assist him in 
his efforts to prevent a mortgage foreclosure and to facilitate a short sale, and another 
law firm to review his accounts and determine consolidation and repayment strategies. 
He contacted his creditors and collection agents regarding his delinquent accounts, and 
tried to work out repayment arrangements. He settled some accounts and paid off 
others. All of his SOR and non-SOR delinquencies have either been resolved or are in 
the process of being resolved. He no longer has any other delinquent debts. Applicant 
spoke with his mortgage holder and explored mortgage modifications and short sales. 
He applied for assistance under the HAMP, but that application was rejected. Nearly 
two weeks before the SOR was issued, Applicant finally rented his residence, and he 
now receives additional income in the form of rent. He is enrolled in a program to enable 
him to pay off his mortgage delinquency. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.57 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.58       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or sold, and his residence went into a foreclosure 
status. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, they were largely beyond Applicant’s 
control. Applicant contacted his creditors and collection agents, and sought the 
assistance of two law firms. While he was unable to commence making payments 
simultaneously on all of the accounts, Applicant did attempt to enter into repayment 
plans with his creditors. The result was positive. He resolved a number of accounts, 
including non-SOR accounts, well before the SOR was even issued. The one remaining 
delinquency was his home mortgage, and his initial unsuccessful efforts to seek 
modification under the HAMP and later to obtain a short sale, were followed by 
successful efforts to have the mortgage reinstated and paid. Applicant’s actions under 
the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:59 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is

not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
