GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 14, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On August 16, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on September, 
5, 2012.2 On September 21, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 3, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
October 4, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On January 3, 2013, Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2013. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 15, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on May 8, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and 10 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 16, 2013. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, and he 
submitted two additional exhibits (AE K and AE L) that were admitted into evidence 
without objection. The record closed on May 17, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.d.) pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since July 
2012, has served as a principal acquisition program management analyst.3 He was 
previously employed by other employers in various positions, including program analyst, 
acquisition program analyst, acquisition logistician, program manager, logistics 
manager, acquisition analyst, and combat systems engineer.4 He also experienced 
several lengthy periods of unemployment due to being laid off.5 He is a June 1979 high 
school graduate and a June 1981 technical college graduate with an associate’s 
degree. Applicant also attended the Defense Acquisition University where he received 
certifications under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA).6 He

a secret security clearance since 1987.9 
 
Financial Considerations 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
1993. Applicant had purchased a residence and accumulated “a lot of debts” when the 
interest rates “skyrocketed” to a level that made it “unaffordable” for him to remain 
current on his monthly payments. He consulted with an attorney who advised him to file 
for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He did so, and in October 
1993, approximately $30,000 in nonpriority, unsecured debts were discharged (SOR & 
1.d).10 Applicant offered no explanation for how he developed his financial problems 
other than that he was young, he had accumulated a lot of credit card debt and student 
loan debt, and the interest rates skyrocketed.11  
Following the 1993 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant’s financial situation improved 
and, with one exception, over the next decade, it was fairly stable, and he continued to 
pay his accounts on time.12 In September 2005, he was laid off from his position paying 
$115,000 per year. He decided to open a business, and in late 2005 or early 2006, 
withdrew $182,000 from his 401(k) retirement account to open two retail stores.13 He 
purchased one store, rented another store, had them repaired, purchased merchandise, 
had the stores stocked, and hired employees.14 In 2007, operating costs became too 
high due to the price of gasoline, freight, and inventory stock. His business debt rose to 
$200,000, and after nine months of operating, because of a lack of income revenue and 
operating capital, he was forced to close both businesses.15 Unable to maintain his 
business and personal monthly payments, accounts became delinquent and were 
placed for collection. Unemployed and penniless, and in an effort to save his home from 
foreclosure, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. He also accepted temporary 
positions with companies in an effort to make additional funds to address his finances.16 
He served in Afghanistan for several months in 2008, transitioning Humvees from the

U.S. Government and coalition countries to the Afghan National Police and the Afghan 
National Army.17 In July 2009, his business assets and inventory were sold off, and 
somewhere between $60,000 and $85,000 in nonpriority, unsecured debts were 
discharged (SOR & 1.c).18 
Since his 2009 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant managed to pay off his student 
loans and medical bills, and stopped using credit cards.19 With the exception of two 
accounts, discussed further below, Applicant is current on all his accounts.20 In 
September 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement. It reflected a net 
monthly income of $7,865, with $1,364 in monthly expenses, and an additional $1,520 
in debt payments.21 He claimed $4,981 left over each month for discretionary spending 
or savings.22  
As noted above, when Applicant decided to open his business in late 2005 or 
early 2006, he withdrew $182,000 from his 401(k) retirement account. As a result of that 
withdrawal, at the end of the year, he was assessed both a federal and a state tax on 
the amount.23 At the time, he was under the impression that the revenues from the 
stores would be sufficient to cover those expenses, but when the economy deteriorated 
and his business lost income, reality set in and he had insufficient funds to pay the 
taxes.24 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed against him a debt of $92,860 for 
the tax period ending in December 2007 (SOR & 1.a), and filed a lien in that amount.25 
The state assessed against him a debt of $24,254 for the same tax period in addition to 
another year (SOR & 1.b), and filed a lien in that amount.26 The tax assessments and 
liens are based solely on Applicant’s early withdrawal of his 401(k), and have nothing to

he failed to include in his monthly expenses a variety of expenses, including real estate taxes, homeowner insurance, 
medical expenses, automobile rental, and fuel. Those expenses would increase his monthly expenses and reduce his 
net remainder by an equal amount. Furthermore, as to his medical expenses, Applicant is afflicted with a condition 
that requires medication costing between $2,000 and $2,400 per month, but which can be reduced to $50 to $100 
when he has medical insurance. See Tr. at 43; AE K (Letter, dated May 15, 2013); AE L (Insurance Medication 
Transactions, dated May 9, 2013).

do with any other types of tax, such as payroll taxes (which were paid) or simple income 
taxes.27 
In September 2009, Applicant sought guidance from a tax attorney and a tax 
resolution specialist to assist him in resolving the two liens. They were paid $8,000 to 
represent him.28 The account with the IRS is presently in a “closed” status as “currently 
not collectible.”29 The account was closed by the IRS because it was determined that 
Applicant does not have the ability to pay the money he owes “at this time.”30 
Applicant’s tax attorney and tax resolution specialists have been working with the state 
in an effort to resolve that account, and they have submitted a number of offers of 
compromise, but all of those offers have, so far, been rejected.31 The state department 
of revenue informed him that a proposed offer could not be accepted because 
Applicant’s “age and earnings potential indicate more could be collected over the 
statutory period of collection than the amount proposed in settlement.”32  
Applicant received financial counseling when he went through his bankruptcies. 
Although he has engaged the services of professionals to assist him with the tax issues, 
they have not furnished him any financial guidance with respect to repayment plans or 
the consolidation of loans.33 
Character References  
 
 Applicant’s past and current colleagues are very supportive of his application to 
retain his security clearance. He has been described as honest, hardworking, 
conscientious, meticulous, dependable, diligent, very professional, and intelligent, with 
an attention to detail.34 It was noted that Applicant was the principal acquisition program 
analyst of the largest foreign military sale in U.S. history, worth over $29 billion, and he 
insured adherence to all U.S. policies pertaining to the transfer.35 Applicant was also 
described as a loving and caring son, furnishing continuing personal and financial 
support for a mother with Alzheimer’s disease and a father with dementia.36

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”38   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”41 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”42 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant initially started experiencing some financial difficulties 
shortly before his 1993 bankruptcy discharge. Financial problems resurfaced over a 
decade later, and in 2009, he again went through his second bankruptcy discharge.  
Applicant still has two pending tax assessments and liens. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.

8 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.43  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all partially apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties, initially since 
before 1993, and then since before 2009, with tax liens continuing until today, make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” His initial 
financial problems occurred 20 years ago, and were attributed to skyrocketing interest 
rates that made it unaffordable for him to maintain his monthly payments. Following the 
recommendation of an attorney, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, and in October 
1993, approximately $30,000 in nonpriority, unsecured debts were discharged. Over the 
ensuing decade, Applicant’s financial situation remained fairly stable.  
Applicant’s subsequent indebtedness was not caused by frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial 
problems were largely beyond Applicant’s control. In September 2005, Applicant was 
laid off from his position paying $115,000 per year. With $182,000 in his 401(k) 
retirement account, he decided to go into business for himself. After reviewing his 
business plan, he opened two retail stores. Unfortunately, by 2007, operating costs 
became too high due to the rising price of gasoline, freight, and inventory stock. With 
the economy entering a downward spiral, his business debt rose and with a lack of 
income revenue and operating capital, he was forced to close both stores. He was 
unable to maintain both his business and personal monthly payments, and accounts 
                                                          
43
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

again became delinquent. Applicant was unemployed, penniless, and caring for two ill 
parents. In an effort to save his home from foreclosure, he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 in 2009. Between $60,000 and $85,000 in nonpriority, unsecured debts were 
discharged. 
Applicant tried to obtain additional funds by accepting temporary positions. Since 
his 2009 bankruptcy discharge, he paid off his student loans and medical bills, and 
stopped using credit cards. With the exception of the two tax liens, he is current with all 
other bills. As of September 2012, Applicant had approximately $4,981 left over each 
month for discretionary spending. With the guidance received from his tax attorney and 
tax resolution specialists, Applicant is in the process of attempting to resolve the tax 
liens. The federal tax lien is currently considered not collectable, but this status will 
change when Applicant’s income increases. The state tax lien has not yet been 
resolved, but there are continuing negotiations to find a mutually acceptable offer in 
compromise. While there is evidence that Applicant received financial counseling 
associated with his bankruptcies, but no other financial counseling, there are clear 
indications that, with the exception of his two tax liens, his financial problems have been 
resolved and are under control.44 Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his 
delinquent accounts rather than avoiding them. Under the circumstances, Applicant’s 
actions do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.45 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
                                                          
44
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.46       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. Despite having 
those delinquent accounts discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993, financial 
difficulties reappeared over a decade later and new accounts eventually became 
delinquent, leading to another discharge in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 2009. 
Because of his early withdrawal of his 401(k) retirement funds, the IRS assessed 
against him a debt of $92,860, and filed a lien in that amount, and the state assessed 
against him a debt of $24,254, and filed a lien in that amount.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. As 
noted by Department Counsel, Applicant is the “quintessential victim of the economy.”47 
As a result of the deteriorating economy and a business downturn, Applicant not only 
lost his business and his retirement account, but also incurred the taxes for withdrawing 
those funds to set up his business. Applicant sought the assistance of a tax attorney 
and a tax resolution specialist; resolved several accounts through his bankruptcy 
discharges; and resolved other accounts by paying the creditors. The federal tax lien is 
currently closed, and the state tax lien is in the negotiating process which Applicant 
hopes will result in a mutually acceptable offer in compromise. Applicant has not 
generated any further delinquent accounts since the 2009 bankruptcy discharge. His 
only liability is due to his early withdrawal of his 401(k) retirement funds. Applicant 
intends to pay his two remaining creditors when he is able to do so. He possesses an 
excellent reputation in the workplace and is a loving and caring son for two ill parents. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:48 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and

unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts, 
albeit through bankruptcy in 1993 and again in 2009, and by paying off his student loans 
and medical bills. This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue his 
debt resolution efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his 
future eligibility for a security clearance.49 Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005);
