GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 11, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On March 16, 2010, he submitted another e-QIP 
version of a SF 86.2 On August 21, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December

29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 1, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
October 18, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 30, 2012, citing 
the Directive, Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural Guidance, ¶ E3.1.7., Department 
Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 13, 2012. The case 
was initially assigned to me on January 4, 2013, but because Applicant had been 
deployed overseas for an extended period of time, the case file was returned for future 
scheduling. In April 2013, Applicant’s attorney informed Department Counsel of 
Applicant’s return to the United States for a brief period of time. The case was 
reassigned to me April 9, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 9, 2013, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, by video teleconference, on April 15, 2013. 
Because of technical difficulties with the video teleconference system, only a portion of 
the hearing was completed. Another Notice of Hearing was issued on April 16, 2013, 
and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, by video teleconference, on April 17, 2013.3 
 
 During the two segments of the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE 1 through 
GE 5) and 18 Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE R) were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified. The first transcript (Tr. I) was received on April 24, 
2013, and the second transcript (Tr. II) was received on April 26, 2013. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, 
and he submitted one additional document which was marked as AE S, and admitted 
into evidence without objection. The record closed on April 26, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a portion of the sole factual 
allegation pertaining to financial considerations (¶ 1.a.). Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since March 
2010, has served as a linguist for U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. He was previously 
employed as a role player and cultural advisor during military training at facilities within 
the United States.4 He has a secret clearance that was granted to him in 2010.5

 Applicant specifically waived the 15-day notice of hearing requirement set forth in the Directive, Enclosure 
3, Additional Procedural Guidance, ¶ E3.1.8. See E-mail from Applicant’s Attorney, dated April 8, 2013; 1
st
 Tr. at 10.

Applicant was born in Afghanistan, immigrated as a refugee to the United States in 
1982, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1992. Applicant’s father is 
deceased; his mother and siblings all reside in the United States, and all are naturalized 
U.S. citizens. Several of his siblings serve as linguists or role players for defense 
contractors. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military or with any military service 
of another country. He was married in 1986, and divorced in 2007. He has four sons 
(born in 1987, 1991, 1994, and 2004 respectively).  
 
Financial Considerations 
In the late 1990’s, Applicant sustained workplace injuries to his neck, rotator cuff, 
and back, while he was employed as a machine operator. He underwent rotator cuff 
surgery, and received workers compensation payments, and then Social Security 
disability payments.6 There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances 
until about 2002. Through his ownership of a corporation in the early 2000s, Applicant 
worked both part-time and, on occasion, full-time at a restaurant he established in 
August 2001, primarily to provide a business opportunity for his son. While at the 
restaurant, Applicant sustained another injury to his neck and shoulder, and underwent 
neck fusion surgery. He continues to receive periodic injections of Cortisol to control his 
neck pain for up to three or four months.7 Because he was unable to continue helping 
run the business, the restaurant closed in mid-2002.8 There were substantial startup 
costs associated with the restaurant, and it had not been in operation long enough to 
generate income. Applicant’s available financial resources, including his wife’s income 
and his disability payments, were insufficient to enable him to maintain all of his 
accounts in a current status, and they became delinquent. In June 2002, Applicant filed 
for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. His unsecured debts 
totaling $129,894, were discharged.9 
Appellant was unemployed from the time of his 2002 injury until 2007.10 In 2006, 
Applicant’s corporation opened a liquor store, and he and his family operated it until 
2007, when it was sold.11  
When Applicant initially applied for Social Security disability benefits, he 
completed some paperwork and was required to be examined by physicians selected by

the Social Security Administration (SSA). The physicians supported Applicant’s claim for 
benefits, and SSA determined the monetary amount to be granted.12 Over time, every 
two or three years, Applicant was required to submit to additional medical 
examinations.13 His most recent examination was in 2007 or 2008.14 Applicant was also 
required to inform the SSA regarding any work performed by him, and he generally did 
so by telephone. In January 2010, the SSA inquired about his employment during 2008, 
and asked him to complete a work activity report to update the information in his file.15 
In July 2010, the SSA informed Applicant that the information he had previously 
furnished them had been forwarded to a representative to determine what effect the 
changes in his work will have on his disability payments.16  
In April 2011, the SSA determined that he was “no longer entitled to . . . disability 
payments for October 2009 through December 2009 and February 2010 through 
February 2011 because of substantial work.”17 The SSA added that Applicant’s 
payments continued during his trial work months while he tested his ability to work. His 
trial work period ended June 2009.18 Applicant was declared entitled to payments for 
January 2010 because his work was not substantial for that time, and he was deemed 
entitled to payments beginning March 2011 because he was no longer doing substantial 
work. He was informed he would receive $1,332 for April 2011 in about mid-May 2011, 
with payments continuing monthly thereafter for an undetermined period.19 SSA also 
stated that “[b]cause we did not stop your checks timely, you were paid $22,837.80 too 
much in benefits.”20 He was informed that the overpayment should be refunded with 30 
days, and if it was not, future benefits would be withheld until the overpayment is fully 
recovered.21 He was also advised that he could file an appeal or request a waiver.22 
Similar, but not identical, letters were sent in February 2011, May 2011, and June 
2011.23

In March 2012, the SSA reaffirmed its earlier decision and again requested 
payment of the $22,837.80.24 However, four months later, in July 2012, the SSA 
reversed an earlier decision made in April 2011, and decided that Applicant was not 
eligible for disability payments from March 2011 to May 2011, and declared that there 
had been an overpayment of $4,285.50 for that period.25 He was again informed that 
the overpayment, now in the amount of $27,123.30, should be refunded with 30 days, 
and if it was not, future benefits would be withheld until the overpayment is fully 
recovered.26 He was also advised that he could file an appeal or request a waiver.27 
Applicant acknowledged the situation, but he planned on disputing the overpayment 
because he felt the error was due to the SSA’s mistake.28 He subsequently modified his 
position, and now agrees that he needs to repay the disputed amount.29 
 
During the period in which Applicant received his Social Security disability 
benefits, he only applied for those benefits once, and thereafter, never reapplied for 
them. He simply furnished the SSA requested information, generally by telephone or in 
writing, but on occasion, in person, and the benefits continued.30 Communications with 
the SSA was extremely difficult for Applicant, especially while he is deployed. The SSA 
would send letters to Applicant’s home in the United States, and his son would either 
forward them to his father or wait until they had an opportunity to speak by telephone. 
While he is deployed, Applicant resides in a tent with three soldiers, and they do not 
have any form of communications, such as telephones or Internet.31 There is also a 
nine-hour time difference. The commander has an office telephone and several 
computers, and personnel are permitted to periodically use the telephone for 15 minutes 
per call, and the computers for about 20 minutes.32 Unfortunately, when Applicant has 
attempted to make some calls to the SSA, he might be placed on hold for longer than 
30 or 45 minutes.33 Applicant returns to the United States every six months for two 
weeks of home leave, and during those brief periods he generally attempts to resolve 
issues with the SSA.

On September 7, 2012, after discussing various payment options,34 Applicant 
and the SSA agreed that, effective October 2012, Applicant would have $300 per month 
deducted from his benefit amount until the balance is paid in full, and that if he is not 
currently receiving benefits, he would be responsible for mailing in his payments.35 He is 
making the payments, through his son in the United States, by check each month.36 In 
November 2012, the SSA acknowledged payments and a decrease in the balance from 
$22,837.80 and indicated the new balance was $3,985.50.37 However, confusing the 
entire situation, in December 2012, the SSA declared there was an unexplained 
increase in the balance from $3,985.50 to $26,223.30, while acknowledging 
payments.38 The balance as of February 2013, was $25,623.30.39 
 
In April 2010, Applicant completed a personal financial statement that indicated 
his monthly net income, including disability payments, was $4,040; his monthly 
expenses were $3,920; and his monthly net remainder available for discretionary 
spending or savings was $120.40 When Applicant started his current position, he started 
earning an annual salary of $215,000, and as of the date of his May 2012 counter 
intelligence interview, he had $120,000 in savings.41 
 
Work Performance and Character References 
 
 In recognition of Applicant’s “exceptional performance and dedication” while 
stationed in Afghanistan from April 2010 to January 2012, Applicant was presented with 
a certificate of merit and appreciation for his “selfless service.”42 His annual 
performance assessments reveal an employee whose rating general is “exceeds 
requirement,” while some of his ratings are of the higher level.43 He has been described 
as a valuable asset to any units he supported, as well as an “essential asset in the 
execution of key leader engagements, information operations, electronic support, and 
other operations.”44 Applicant accompanies the military units in the field on their 
missions. While he does not carry a weapon, he wears a helmet and flak jacket.45

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”46 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”47  
  
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”48 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.49

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”50 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”51 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In the late 1990’s, Applicant sustained workplace injuries and 
received workers compensation payments, and then Social Security disability 
payments. There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about

2002. His earlier injuries and additional subsequent injuries resulted in the closure of a 
business he had previously established. With substantial startup costs associated with 
the business, and insufficient income from the faltering business. Applicant’s available 
financial resources, including his wife’s income and his disability payments, were 
insufficient to enable him to maintain all of his accounts in a current status, and they 
became delinquent. In June 2002, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and his unsecured non-priority debts were eventually 
discharged.  
Applicant applied for Social Security disability benefits, and he was examined by 
physicians selected by the SSA. The physicians supported Applicant’s claim for 
benefits, and SSA determined the monetary amount to be granted. In April 2011, the 
SSA determined that he was no longer entitled to disability payments for periods in 
2009 through 2011 because of “substantial work.” Other periods were approved. He 
was informed that he had been paid $22,837.80 too much in benefits, and was informed 
that the overpayment should be refunded with 30 days. He was also advised that he 
could file an appeal or request a waiver. In March 2012, the SSA reaffirmed its earlier 
decision and again requested payment of the $22,837.80. However, four months later, 
the SSA reversed an earlier decision, and decided that Applicant was not eligible for 
disability payments for several months in 2011, and declared that there had been an 
overpayment of $4,285.50 for that period. He was again informed that the overpayment, 
now in the amount of $27,123.30, should be refunded within 30 days. He was also 
advised that he could file an appeal or request a waiver. Applicant acknowledged the 
situation, but he initially planned on disputing the overpayment because he felt the error 
was due to the SSA’s mistake. He subsequently modified his position, and now agrees 
that he needs to repay the disputed overpayment amount. Since his debts were 
discharged, other than the one debt to the SSA, there is no evidence that Applicant has 
experienced financial difficulties, or that he is unable to make routine monthly payments 
for his accounts. To the contrary, there is evidence that Applicant currently has 
$120,000 in savings, with an annual salary of $215,000. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.52

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
10 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply, and AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies. Applicant’s 
financial difficulties occurred in 2002 as a result of workplace injuries sustained in the 
late 1990’s and in 2002. Unable to work over extended periods, a business folded, 
leaving him with startup costs that were too burdensome for him to handle. Those 
factors – the unexpected medical emergencies, his loss of employment, and the 
business downturn – were largely beyond Applicant’s control. He filed for bankruptcy 
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and his unsecured debts were eventually 
discharged. There is no evidence of continuing financial difficulties since his debts were 
discharged approximately 13 years ago. 
There is, however, evidence that the SSA made periodic eligibility determinations 
regarding Applicant’s application for disability benefits, and that the SSA subsequently 
made several corrections to earlier eligibility determinations. Applicant was periodically 
examined by physicians selected by the SSA, and based on the recommendations of 
those physicians, as well as Applicant’s input regarding employment, SSA eligibility 
decisions were made. The evidence reflects that the SSA and Applicant maintained a 
continuing exchange of information over the years. Those decisions were reversed two 
or three years later, and the SSA informed Applicant that he had to refund $27,123.30 
within 30 days. Overseas, and in a combat zone with limited accessibility to 
communications, Applicant disputed the inconsistent decisions of the SSA and 
attempted to resolve the purported overpayment.  
While Applicant was disappointed and dismayed by the eventual changes by the 
SSA regarding his eligibility for disability payments covering certain periods, and his 
disappointment resulted in his initial refusal to resolve the disputed amount because it 
was due to the SSA’s errors, he subsequently modified his position, and agreed to 
repay the disputed amount. In so doing, Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his 
SSA debt. The SSA also advised him that he could file an appeal or request a waiver, 
but there is no evidence that he took either of those two options. In September 2012, 
after discussing various payment options, Applicant and the SSA agreed that, effective 
October 2012, Applicant would have $300 per month deducted from his benefit amount 
until the balance is paid in full, and that if he is not currently receiving benefits, he would 
be responsible for mailing in his payments. Applicant has been making his monthly 
payments since October 2012.53 Considering the fluid nature of the SSA positions, as 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

well as Applicant’s overseas employment and poor available communications, 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.54 While there is no evidence that 
Applicant has received or is receiving counseling for the SSA balance, now that there is 
an agreement in place, and the agreement is being followed, and with $120,000 in 
savings, with an annual salary of $215,000, there are clear indications that the 
“problem” is being resolved or is under control. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.55       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 2002, his 
unsecured non-priority debts totaling $129,894, were discharged in bankruptcy. Over a 
multiple year period, Applicant received an overpayment of disability benefits from the 
SSA totaling $27,123.30. The SSA advised him that the amount should be refunded 
within 30 days, and that he could appeal the determination. The overpayment was the 
result of an SSA reassessment that Applicant was not entitled to that amount, based on 
his other periodic “substantial work.” Although Applicant has $120,000 in savings, and 
an annual salary of $215,000, he opted to pay the SSA $300 per month, which was an 
arrangement that was satisfactory to the SSA.

13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
When Applicant initially applied for Social Security disability benefits, he was examined 
by physicians selected by the SSA, and they supported his claim for benefits. The SSA 
determined the monetary amount to be granted. Over time, every two or three years, 
Applicant was required to submit to additional medical examinations. He was also 
required to inform the SSA regarding any work performed by him, and he generally did 
so by telephone. In April 2011, the SSA determined that he was no longer entitled to 
disability payments for certain periods in 2009 through 2011 because of “substantial 
work.” Other periods were approved. He was informed that he had been paid 
$22,837.80 too much in benefits. In March 2012, the SSA reaffirmed its earlier decision 
and again requested the overpayment. However, four months later, the SSA reversed 
an earlier decision, and decided that Applicant was not eligible for disability payments 
for several months in 2011, and declared that there had been an overpayment of 
$4,285.50 for that period. He was again informed that the overpayment, now in the 
amount of $27,123.30, should be refunded within 30 days.  
 
Applicant is a linguist serving with U.S. military combat forces in Afghanistan, and 
is generally in harm’s way. Communications with the SSA was extremely difficult for 
Applicant, especially while he is deployed, because he resides in a tent with three 
soldiers, and they do not have any form of communications, such as telephones or 
Internet. There is also a nine-hour time difference. The commander has an office 
telephone and several computers, and personnel are permitted to periodically use the 
telephone for 15 minutes per call, and the computers for about 20 minutes. 
Unfortunately, when Applicant has attempted to make some calls to the SSA, he might 
be placed on hold for longer than 30 or 45 minutes. Applicant returns to the United 
States every six months for two weeks of home leave, and during those brief periods he 
generally attempts to resolve issues with the SSA. In September 2012, after discussing 
various payment options, Applicant and the SSA agreed that, effective October 2012, 
Applicant would have $300 per month deducted from his benefit amount until the 
balance is paid in full, and that if he is not currently receiving benefits, he would be 
responsible for mailing in his payments. Applicant has been making his monthly 
payments since October 2012. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting 
him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He 
possesses an excellent reputation in the workplace. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:56 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to

13 
                                      
 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination pertaining to the sole debt, an overpayment by the SSA. He has made some 
significant timely efforts to resolve this overpayment, but his efforts were made more 
difficult by the limitations on his availability of communications in Afghanistan. In 
addition, there was the fluid nature of the SSA decisions. While Applicant may have the 
resources to pay the entire overpayment balance in its entirety now, Applicant chose an 
option offered to him and approved by the SSA. The selected repayment plan is 
reasonable. I found Applicant to be credible, and his service in a combat zone warrants 
substantial credit. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
