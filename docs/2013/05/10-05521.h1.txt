FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 26, 2010, Applicant’s employer submitted a Joint Personnel 
Adjudication System (JPAS) incident report after Applicant’s fellow employees 
complained that he fraudulently sold candy for a school fundraiser and failed to deliver 
the candy. The JPAS incident report also stated that a review of Applicant’s credit 
bureau report (CBR) reflected numerous delinquent debts. (GX 7.) On January 3, 2013, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging 
security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.

 Applicant received the SOR on January 11, 2013; answered it on January 24, 
2013; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on March 18, 2013, and the case was assigned to me on March 
28, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of 
hearing on April 2, 2013, scheduling the hearing for April 24, 2013. I convened the 
hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence 
without objection. Department Counsel also submitted a demonstrative exhibit 
summarizing the Government’s evidence, and it is attached to the record as Hearing 
Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A, a collection 
of exhibits labeled Appendix A through G, which was admitted without objection. I kept 
the record open until May 10, 2013, to enable Applicant to submit additional 
documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX B through D, which were admitted 
without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX B through D are 
attached to the record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.d-1.g, 1.i, 1.r, and 1.t. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are 
incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He worked for other 
federal contractors from May 2004 to October 2011. He was fired for sleeping on the job 
in September 2007, which he attributed to sleep apnea. (GX 3 at 7.) He began working 
for another federal contractor in October 2007 and remained in that job until he was laid 
off due to a reduction in force in September 2011. (AX A at Appendix F.) Four days after 
being laid off, he was hired by his current employer, but his current pay is about 
$24,000 less (from $65,000 to $41,000) than he earned at his previous job. (AX A at 
Appendix G; Tr. 23, 46.) He has held a security clearance since April 2003. He 
submitted an application to continue his clearance in August 2008, and his clearance 
was continued in March 2009. (GX 1 at 28; GX 7.) 
 
 Applicant married in April 1999, separated in November 2005, and divorced in 
March 2007. (Tr. 46-47.) One child was born during the marriage. He has joint custody 
of this child and pays child support to the child’s mother. (Tr. 37-38.) When he divorced, 
he gave the family home and furnishings to his wife. (Tr. 42.) He has sole custody of 
another child, who was born out of wedlock in April 1997, and he receives child support 
of $500 per month from the child’s mother, who is on active duty in the U.S. Navy. (GX 
3 at 5-6.) 
 
 Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in April 1990 and served on active duty until 
November 1995. He was then transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve until he was 
honorably discharged in January 2000. (GX 3 at 6.) He attended college from February 
2004 to April 2005 but did not receive a degree.

 Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 1999. His total liabilities 
were about $31,794 and his assets were about $3,627. All of his debts were included in 
the bankruptcy except for a $5,000 student loan. (GX 9.) 
 
 During a personal subject interview (PSI) in October 2011, Applicant told an 
investigator that he began to have financial problems in late 2009. He admitted that his 
problems were caused by overspending and helping family members. (GX 3 at 9.) At 
the hearing, he testified that his financial problems began in 2007 or 2008. He gave 
money to his brothers, who were in financial distress. He was contemplating marriage to 
a woman who had four children, and they moved into a larger, more expensive house 
and split the rent. When they broke up, Applicant was solely responsible for the rent for 
the remainder of the lease, which expires in June 2013. (Tr. 88-91.) When Applicant’s 
grandmother passed away in November 2010, he contributed $2,500 for her funeral 
expenses. (Tr. 87-91; AX A at Appendix D.) 
 
In his PSI, Applicant explained that the incident in the JPAS report occurred 
because he sold candy for his daughter’s school fundraiser but that some deliveries 
were delayed. He refunded the purchase money. He received a written warning, 
because selling candy at work violated company policy. (GX 2 at 7-8; GX 3 at 7-8.) 
 
In August 2012, Applicant signed a contract with a debt management company, 
and several of his delinquent debts are included in his debt management program. The 
evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a: $252, credit card account referred for collection in November 
2006. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he intended to pay this debt in 
February 2013. At the hearing, he testified that he could not afford the full amount due 
and the creditor would not accept partial payments. He intends to add this debt to his 
debt management program, but he presented no evidence that the creditor will agree to 
participate in his program. (Tr. 53-54.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b: $625, credit card account charged off in October 2007. In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he intended to pay this debt in March 2013. At 
the hearing, he testified that he offered to pay $75 per month but the creditor demanded 
$150, which he could not afford. He intends to add this debt to his debt management 
program, but he presented no evidence that the creditor will agree to participate in his 
program. (Tr. 54-55.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c: delinquent personal loan charged off for $1,500 in June 2008. 
This debt is included in Applicant’s debt management program. (AX D.) He testified that 
this debt is included in the larger debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g (Tr. 57.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d: delinquent student loans for $17,741, referred for collection in 
September 2009. Applicant’s February 2010 credit bureau report (CBR) reflected that 
his student loans were either in deferment or being paid as agreed. (GX 6 at 12-16.) 
However, his June 2011 CBR reflected that his student loans had been referred for 
 
4 
 
collection in September 2009. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant began making reduced payments 
in October 2011 under a loan rehabilitation program, and the loans are now current. As 
of the date the record closed, he was waiting for his new lender to determine the 
amount of his new loan payments. (GX 3 at 8; AX A at Appendix B; AX C; Tr. 59-60.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e: delinquent account with unidentified creditor for $490, referred 
for collection in June 2007. Applicant testified that he does not know the identity of the 
original creditor. (Tr. 63.) However, this debt is included in his debt management plan. 
(AX D.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.t: delinquent debts to unidentified creditors, referred for 
collection for $95 and $168 in July and August 2007. These debts are included in 
Applicant’s debt management plan. (AX D.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g: charged off for $6,500 in June 2008.  Applicant testified that this 
debt includes the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c and the deficiency from an auto 
repossession alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Tr. 57.) It is included in his debt management plan. 
(AX D.) 
 
SOR 1.h: auto loan charged off for $21,159. This account is listed on 
Applicant’s credit bureau report as a closed or paid account with a zero balance. (GX 5 
at 3.) The amount alleged in the SOR appears to be the original amount of the loan. 
Applicant testified that he owes this creditor $4,000, the deficiency remaining after a 
repossession and sale of his auto. He testified that this debt is included in SOR ¶ 1.g. 
(Tr. 57.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i: credit card account for $617, referred for collection in March 
2007. This debt is included in Applicant’s debt management plan. (AX D; Tr.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.p: delinquent medical bills in varying amounts from $39 to 
$605, referred for collection between July 2005 and July 2009. In Applicant’s 
answer to the SOR, he denied all these debts and asserted that he had disputed them 
and they had been removed from his credit record. At the hearing, he testified that these 
debts, totaling about $1,394, had been referred to one collection agency and are 
included in his debt management plan. (Tr. 66, 70-71; AX D.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.q: bad check for $249, referred for collection in August 2005. In 
Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that this debt had been paid and removed 
from his credit report. It is listed on his June 2011 CBR as “checked,” and it does not 
appear on his December 2012 CBR. (GX 4; GX 6.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.r: delinquent cell phone bill for $1,142, referred for collection in 
January 2006. This debt is included in Applicant’s debt management plan. (AX D.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.s: delinquent credit card account for $1,571, referred for collection 
in January 2005. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he denied this debt. He stated that 
 
5 
 
he disputed it and it was removed from his credit record. It does not appear on his 
January 2013 CBR. (AX A at Appendix A.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.u: delinquent credit card account for $587, referred for collection 
in March 2005. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he denied this debt and stated that it 
was disputed and removed from his credit record. He testified that the account was a 
corporate credit card that he had while employed by a former employer, and that he 
cleared that account before he changed jobs. (Tr. 76-77.) The debt does not appear on 
his December 2012 and January 2013 CBRs. (GX 4; AX A at Appendix A.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.v-1.z: bad checks uttered to a military exchange, in various 
amounts from $80 to $561 in 2007 and 2008. Applicant’s June 2011 CBR reflects that 
these bad checks were redeemed shortly after they were reported to the credit reporting 
agencies. (GX 5.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.aa and 1.bb: health club membership fees for $812 and $248, 
referred for collection in October 2008. Applicant denied these debts in his answer to 
the SOR. He testified that he paid the debts in the 2002-2004 timeframe. He disputed 
the debts and they were removed from his credit record. (Tr. 78-79.) The debts are not 
reflected on his December 2012 and January 2013 CBRs. (GX 4; AX A at Appendix A.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.cc: cell phone account for $454, referred for collection in July 
2006. Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR. He disputed the debt and it 
was removed from his credit record. It does not appear on his December 2012 and 
January 2013 CBRs. (GX 4; AX A at Appendix A.)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.dd: cable account for $412, referred for collection in December 
2007. Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR. He disputed the debt and it 
was removed from his credit record. It does not appear on his December 2012 and 
January 2013 CBRs. (GX 4; AX A at Appendix A.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.ee: auto insurance bill for $118, referred for collection on an 
unknown date. Applied denied this debt in his answer to the SOR. He testified that he 
paid it in 2007. (Tr. 83.) He disputed the debt and it was removed from his credit record. 
It does not appear on his December 2012 and January 2013 CBRs. (GX 4; AX A at 
Appendix A.) 
 
Applicant’s current monthly gross salary is about $3,700. He lives in the house 
that he leased with his former fiancée. His current fiancée is living with him and sharing 
the rent. He estimates that his net monthly remainder is between $400 and $500 after 
paying all his living expenses. The monthly payments on his rehabilitated student loan 
have not yet been determined, and they will reduce his net monthly remainder. (Tr. 93-
96.) 
 
Three coworkers who have known Applicant for about four years submitted 
letters on his behalf, describing him as talented, dedicated, ambitious, responsible, and 
 
6 
 
a person of unwavering integrity. Another coworker who has known him for two years 
commented favorably on his outstanding work ethic, good judgment, and high integrity. 
(AX A at Appendices E and F.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
7 
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
The SOR alleges 31 delinquent debts. The concern under this guideline is set out 
in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant testified that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g includes the delinquent 
personal loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c and the $4,000 deficiency after a repossession to 
collect the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. The same creditor is alleged for all three debts. 
Applicant’s June 2011 CBR reflects that the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h is a paid or 
closed account with a zero balance, which is consistent with Applicant’s testimony that 
the amount due on the auto loan was combined with other debts owed to this creditor. 
When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of 
the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 
03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have 
resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.h in Applicant’s favor, and they will not be discussed further 
in the analysis below.  
 
 Applicant’s admissions, testimony at the hearing, and his CBRs establish the 
following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  
 
 
8 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, not yet 
resolved, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant encountered several conditions 
beyond his control, i.e., his separation in November 2005, divorce in March 2007, and 
pay reduction in September 2011. His loss of a second family income in November 
2005 preceded the delinquent debts in the SOR, but all the debts alleged in the SOR 
were delinquent before his pay reduction in September 2011. Furthermore, Applicant 
has not acted responsibly. Even after his pay reduction, he has a net monthly remainder 
of $400-$500, but he has not explained why he has not used all or part of that 
remainder to resolve his delinquent debts, especially the smaller ones. He did not start 
contacting his creditors until after the JPAS incident report in January 2010. He did not 
begin his student loan rehabilitation until October 2011. He did not begin working with a 
debt management agency until August 2012.  
 
9 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant is receiving counseling, but he has 
not yet included all his delinquent debts in his debt management plan, and insufficient 
time has passed for him to establish a track record of compliance with his plan. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not fully established. “Good faith” within the meaning of this 
mitigating condition means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 
1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-
collection procedure. It is focused on evaluating an individual’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not 
required to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement 
the plan. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments 
on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
However, evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts 
only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. The fundamental issue is not 
whether the debts are resolved, but whether an individual’s actions demonstrate 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. The record 
reflects that Applicant promptly redeemed his bad checks written to a military exchange 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.v-1.z), but he did not begin contacting his other creditors until after his 
employer filed the JPAS incident report in January 2010. Although Applicant has a plan 
and has taken significant actions to implement it, the timing of his efforts to resolve his 
financial problems indicates that they were motivated by concern for his security 
clearance rather than a sense of duty or obligation. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is 
established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.v-1.z, but not for the other debts alleged 
in the SOR.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.s, 1.u, and 1.aa 
through 1.ee, which Applicant successfully disputed. It is not established for the other 
debts alleged in the SOR.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
10 
 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Army and has worked for federal 
contractors for nine years. He has held a security clearance for all his federal service. 
He is devoted to his children. He has been generous with his siblings, to his own 
financial detriment. He has made considerable progress, albeit belated, in resolving his 
financial problems. On the other hand, he has a long track record of financial problems 
that began before his 1999 bankruptcy discharge, and he did not begin to seriously 
address his current financial problems until they triggered a JPAS incident report. He 
has not yet established a track record of compliance with his debt management plan. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial problems. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.d-1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.i-1.p:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.q:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.r:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.s:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.t:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.u-1.ee:    For Applicant 
 
 
11 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
