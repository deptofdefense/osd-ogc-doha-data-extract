GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 3, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on July 
6, 2012.2 On another unspecified date, the DOD issued her a request for a subject 
interview verification. She responded to the request on July 6, 2012.3 The DOD issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her on July 30, 2012, under Executive Order 10865,

Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 7, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated July 
30, 2012,4 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have her case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on February 28, 2013, and 
she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, 
to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on March 12, 2013, but, as of April 19, 2013, she had not submitted 
a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 23, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant essentially admitted all of the factual 
allegations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.k.) of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old full-time employee of a defense contractor who, since 
February 1977, has been serving as an office administrator. She has also held a part- 
time, weekend, position with a medical center as a unit secretary, since July 2000. She 
has never served in the U.S. military.5 She was granted a top secret security clearance 
in 2002.6  
 
A 1976 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate’s degree in an 
unspecified discipline in May 1990. She was married in August 1979, and was divorced 
in December 1998.7 She has two children, a daughter and a son, born in 1981 and 
1984, respectively.

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until April 16, 1997, when 
she filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code, listing $162,350 in assets (claimed as exempt) and $282,079.98 in liabilities.8 
The major assets were two residences worth $155,000. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy 
trustee concluded that the assets were inconsequential or were encumbered beyond 
value. The total value of Applicant’s personal property was reflected as $7,350, of which 
$1,750 was a motor vehicle, and $5,600 was for household goods, jewelry, and wearing 
apparel.9 The 15 listed creditor accounts were for mortgages, equity loans, lines of 
credit, retail accounts, credit cards, personal loans, and dental care.10 Applicant’s 
unsecured non-priority debts were discharged on August 18, 1997.11 Although Applicant 
attributed her financial situation to her divorce,12 without further explanation or 
elaboration, it should be noted that she was not divorced until December 1998, or 
approximately 20 months after she filed her bankruptcy petition. 
 
Applicant’s financial situation during the early years following the discharge of her 
debts is unclear. In November 2001, she indicated that two of her credit cards were 
“maxed out” the previous April.13 In November 2001, she also submitted a confusing 
financial statement essentially reflecting a net monthly income of $2,744.43, including 
her salary from both employers, alimony, and anticipated child support.14 She claimed 
$2,242.15 in monthly expenses and debt payments.15 Using her reworked numbers, she 
had $2.28 left over each month for discretionary spending or savings. In the four and 
one-half years since her bankruptcy discharge, Applicant’s assets increased 
dramatically. She listed $10,000 in jewelry, clothing, and tools; $45,000 in automobiles; 
and $205,000 in stocks and bonds.16 
  
By the early and mid-2000’s, however, some accounts were past due, placed for 
collection, or charged off.17 During her interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2012, Applicant denied being aware of

any financial problems until October 2007, when a wage garnishment judgment was 
filed against her.18 She attributed her financial problems to two $5,000 loans that she 
obtained in about 2001 or 2002 to assist a friend, whose identity she declined to reveal. 
The friend was supposed to repay the loans with monthly payments of $100, but after 
about six months, the payments stopped.19 As a single mother with two children in 
private school, following the garnishment, Applicant was unable to make payments on 
the loans.20 There is no evidence that Applicant ever took any legal action against her 
“friend” for defaulting on the loans, and claims that she is no longer in touch with the 
friend and has no way of contacting her.21  Exacerbating her financial situation were two 
additional events. A second garnishment was filed in September 2008, and renters in 
her rental property started missing their monthly rental payments.22  
 
There is also evidence that on one occasion in June 2010, Applicant visited a 
casino and made three deposits of $25,000 each, for a total deposit of $75,000.23 
Applicant denied ever engaging in any such transactions, but did acknowledge that in 
June 2010, she hit a slot machine jackpot for $2,500, which she purportedly reported as 
income with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).24 As correctly noted by Department 
Counsel, the law requires casinos to report transactions involving either “cash in” or 
“cash out,” of more than $10,000.25 “Cash out” transactions include redemptions of 
chips, tokens, tickets, etc., payments on bets, cashing of checks, and payment of 
contests and other promotions. “Cash in” transactions include the purchase of chips, 
tokens, bets of currency, etc. Jackpots received from slot machines or video lottery 
terminals need not be reported. Applicant’s explanations in this regard are unsupported 
by any documentation, and contrary to the information appearing in the public business 
records of the FinCEN of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It is unclear as to what 
the source of the $75,000 might have been, or why it was not used to resolve delinquent 
debts. 
 
In July 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a net 
monthly income of $2,100; $800 in monthly expenses, as well as $907 in debt 
payments; with $393 left over each month for discretionary spending or savings.26 In the

decade since her 2001 financial statement, Applicant’s assets decreased dramatically. 
She listed $20,000 in automobiles; and $17,185.47 in stocks and bonds.27 
 
Applicant did not receive any financial counseling or debt consolidation 
counseling after her bankruptcy.28 In January 2012, Applicant indicated she intended to 
address and resolve all of her delinquent accounts.29  
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies, totaling 
approximately $67,070. There is a loan in the amount of $5,000 (supposedly for the 
unidentified friend), placed for collection with an unspecified past due balance, that went 
to judgment in the amount of $6,177 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).30 The creditor obtained a wage 
garnishment for $11,022.75 in August 2010.31 The balance was finally paid off in August 
2011.32 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a loan in the amount of $5,000 (supposedly for the unidentified friend), 
placed for collection with an unspecified past due balance,  that went to judgment in the 
amount of $12,827 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).33 Applicant speculated the amount covered both of the 
loans, noted that the two creditors had merged, and contended she had paid off one 
half of the account.34 She offered no documentation to support her contention that the 
two loans were covered by the same judgment or that she had made payments on this 
particular judgment. During her OPM interview, Applicant acknowledged she had 
recently received a garnishment notice informing her that, effective January 23, 2012, a 
wage garnishment would commence in the amount of $450.35 In her Answer to the 
SOR, she made no mention of any wage garnishment, but noted that she was working 
with her bank, but had no documentation from the creditor to support her claim.36 The 
account remains unresolved.

There is a loan with the same creditor with a high credit of $8,639 and a past due 
unpaid balance of $11,557 that was placed for collection and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.c.).37 
Applicant admitted the SOR allegation, but added that the case had been settled,38 
without offering any further explanation. She submitted no documentation to support her 
contention. The account remains unresolved. 
 
There is a home mortgage with a high credit of $89,370, a past due balance of 
$7,035, and an unpaid balance of $67,491, that went into a foreclosure status (SOR ¶ 
1.d.).39 During her OPM interview, Applicant indicated she was waiting for a foreclosure 
notice from the mortgage lender to enable her to obtain an emergency loan from her 
401(k) retirement account to pay off her past due balance.40 The mortgage lender 
calculated the necessary reinstatement amount of $13,101.47 on May 8, 2012.41 On 
May 17, 2012, she withdrew $14,706.79 from her 401(k),42 and on May 23, 2012, she 
wired the mortgage lender $13,102.43 The foreclosure was rescinded on May 25, 
2012.44 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account with a high credit of $786, and a past due balance 
of $824, that was placed for collection and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.e.).45 During her OPM 
interview, Applicant indicated she fell behind in her monthly payments in January 
2011,46 but she was actually 30 days past due in August 2006,47 and on at least three 
more occasions in 2010.48 She indicated the creditor had offered to settle the account 
for $100 within a month, and she was going to make the payment.49 In August 2012, 
eight months after Applicant’s promise to pay the balance, and having failed to do so, 
the creditor offered her three payment options to resolve the account which by then had

a balance of $849.35.50 Applicant claimed that she accepted the first option, to pay 
$339.74 by August 22, 2012, and she wrote a note saying she had made the payment, 
but she did not submit any documentation to support her contention. Department 
Counsel noted the absence of documentary evidence in the FORM, but Applicant still 
did not submit any documentation. The account remains unresolved. 
 
There is a rental property mortgage with a high credit of $223,319, a past due 
balance of $24,497, and an unpaid balance of $218,498, that went into foreclosure 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.).51 In 2010, the mortgage lender reclaimed the collateral to settle the 
defaulted mortgage.52 Nevertheless, Applicant’s 2012 Equifax credit report continued to 
erroneously report that there was a deficiency or past due balance of $24,000.53 
Applicant is not liable for the deficiency, for under California law, there is a provision 
called the Anti-Deficiency Statute,54 which states in relevant part: 
 
No deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property 
or an estate for years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or 
her contract of sale, or under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the 
vendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price of that real 
property or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or mortgage 
on  a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure 
repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the 
purchase price of that dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the 
purchaser. 
 
Under this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a 
deficiency, the lender has no recourse regarding “purchase money loans,” also called 
“non-recourse loans,” the amount set forth in the mortgage used to finance the 
purchase of the dwelling. The collateral or dwelling is considered full satisfaction. 
However, there is a caveat, for the protection is afforded only if the borrower actually 
dwells in the property, a fact which has not been met for the rental property in this 
instance. However, there is another pertinent law, called the One Form of Action Rule,55 
which states in relevant part: “There can be but one form of action for the recovery of 
any debt, or the performance of any right secured by mortgage upon real property.” 
Accordingly, the comment in the 2011 combined credit report that the mortgage lender 
reclaimed the collateral to settle the defaulted mortgage56 is an accurate reflection of the 
facts, and there is no longer a deficiency. The account has been resolved.

There are four separate telephone accounts with the same creditor with past due 
unpaid balances of $139 (SOR ¶ 1.h.), $182 (SOR ¶ 1.i.), $209 (SOR ¶ 1.j.), and $190 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.), that were placed for collection in 2009 or 2010.57 During her OPM 
interview, Applicant attributed the delinquencies to the possibility that her children had 
failed to make the monthly payments on the phones for which she had “co-signed.”58  
However, the credit reports indicate these were “individual” rather than “joint” 
accounts.59 Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but added that the accounts, 
totaling $720, had been settled for $360.60 She also wrote a note saying she had made 
the agreement and the case is closed, but made no mention of a payment, and she did 
not submit any documentation to support her contention. Department Counsel noted the 
absence of documentary evidence in the FORM, but Applicant still did not submit any 
documentation. The four accounts remain unresolved. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”61 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”62   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

also two accounts with the same creditor, with different account numbers and different balances that were charged off 
in 2006. See Item 10, supra note 17, at 15. Without further information, it is impossible to determine if they are related 
to the ones alleged in the SOR.

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”63 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.64  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”65 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”66 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has a lengthy history of recurring financial problems 
commencing in 1997. Her unsecured non-priority debts were discharged in 1997, but by 
April 2001, she was again experiencing financial problems. Applicant had insufficient 
funds to make all of her monthly account payments. As a result, some accounts started 
to become delinquent, and were placed for collection or charged off. Garnishments 
followed judgments, one rental property was foreclosed, and another was in a 
foreclosure status before it was rescinded. Other accounts remain unresolved. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@67

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
 
11 
                                      
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 1997 make it difficult to conclude that it 
occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” In light of her substantial period of 
continuing financial problems, the repeated promises to resolve her delinquent debts, 
the unsubstantiated contentions that accounts had been resolved and paid, and the 
substantial inaction that followed those promises, it is unlikely that they will be resolved 
in the short term, and they are likely to continue. Under the circumstances, Applicant’s 
actions do cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant generally attributed her initial financial 
problems to a divorce that took place approximately 20 months after she filed for 
bankruptcy. She failed to indicate exactly how the divorce may have contributed to 
those earlier financial problems. Her more recent financial problems were attributed, in 
part, to the failure of her renters to continue making rent payments, and to the 
garnishment of her wages. The garnishment might have been avoided had Applicant 
taken some responsible action in addressing the delinquent account before the account 
went to judgment. There are also substantial unanswered questions regarding 
Applicant’s loans to the unidentified friend, the casino transactions, and the $205,000 in 
stocks and bonds she claimed to possess in November 2001. Under these 
circumstances it is unclear if Applicant acted responsibly.68  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply because Applicant did not receive any financial 
counseling after her 1997 bankruptcy in money management, debt management, debt 
repayment, or budgeting. Furthermore, considering Applicant’s general inaction 
following several promises, over several years, to resolve her accounts, the indications 
are that the financial problems have not been resolved and are not under control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply. Other than the one loan account that was resolved 
involuntarily by garnishment, following a judgment; one account that was resolved 
involuntarily by foreclosure; and the sole account for which Applicant furnished 
documentation to support her contention that her home mortgage was removed from 
foreclosure by her payment, out of her 401(k) account, of the past due balance, there is 
little evidence to indicate that Applicant initiated a voluntary or good-faith effort to repay 
her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. As described above, Department 
Counsel noted the absence of documentary evidence in the FORM, but Applicant still 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

did not submit any of the suggested documentation. Applicant’s statements regarding 
her future intent to resolve her debts, without corroborating documentary evidence 
supporting actual action to do so, are entitled to little weight. Her declarations of future 
intention to resolve her debts, after so much time where little positive efforts were 
voluntarily taken, do not qualify as a “good-faith” effort.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.69       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She resolved 
the deficiency on her home mortgage and saved it from foreclosure. She has 
acknowledged responsibility for her delinquent debts and promised to resolve them. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Of the three accounts that were resolved, one loan account was resolved involuntarily 
by garnishment, following a judgment; and one account was resolved involuntarily by 
foreclosure. There are unanswered questions regarding Applicant’s loans to the 
unidentified friend, the casino transactions, and the $205,000 in stocks and bonds she 
claimed to possess in November 2001. Applicant has never explained how or why her 
portfolio decreased to $17,185.47 in one decade; the casino transactions totaling 
$75,000 in one day; or the loans to her friend. The record is filled with guesstimates and 
general statements by Applicant as to when her general financial problems 
commenced; when specific accounts became delinquent; and that accounts had been 
settled, without submitting documentation to support her contentions. There is little 
evidence to indicate that Applicant initiated a voluntary or good-faith effort to repay her

overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. Applicant’s continuing inaction under 
the circumstances confronting her does cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. Her reputation in the workplace is unknown. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:70 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated the absence of a “meaningful track record” of debt 
reduction and elimination. There are delinquent debts, repeated promises of action to 
resolve those debts, and inaction by Applicant to do so. Instead, there are the 
bankruptcy, judgments, involuntary garnishment, and the involuntary foreclosure. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant 
has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
