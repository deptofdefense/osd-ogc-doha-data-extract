FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on May 23, 2011. On 
January 3, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 16, 2013; answered it on January 24, 
2013; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 26, 2013, 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s last name is spelled as she spelled it in her security clearance application and 
correspondence pertaining to this case, and not as spelled in the SOR.

Applicant requested an expedited hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed 
on April 1, 2013, and the case was assigned to me on April 5, 2013. On the same day, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, 
scheduling the hearing for April 15, 2013. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement in Directive ¶ E3.1.8. (Tr. 
12.) Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Department Counsel’s letter to Applicant, transmitting copies of GX 1 through 6, is 
attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified but presented no 
witnesses or documentary evidence. I kept the record open until April 26, 2013, to 
enable her to present documentary evidence. She timely submitted Applicant’s Exhibits 
(AX) A and B. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX A and B are attached to 
the record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 19, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her 
admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 55-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense 
contractor since May 2011. She previously worked for another defense contractor from 
March 2005 to January 2010. She was laid off and unemployed for 16 months until she 
began her current job. She received a security clearance in March 2006, which was 
administratively terminated in October 2007, when she transferred to another position 
that did not require a clearance. (Tr. 14) She served on active duty in the U.S. Navy 
from September 1982 to March 1984 and received an honorable discharge. She held a 
security clearance while in the Navy. 
 
 Applicant attended college from October 2003 to June 2006 and earned a 
bachelor’s degree. She attended an on-line art institute from August 2007 to March 
2011, preparing for a possible career in interior design, but she did not receive a 
degree. (GX 1 at 14-15.) She stopped the art institute classes after she was laid off, 
because she did not want to incur any more student loans. (Tr. 32.) While she was 
unemployed, she also attended evening classes to qualify as a certified school teacher, 
but she was unable to find any teaching positions. (Tr. 33.) Her only source of income 
from January 2010 to May 2011 was unemployment compensation of about $1,600 per 
month. (Tr. 34.) In her present job, she earns about $55,000 per year. (Tr. 34-35.) 
 
 Applicant married in February 1984 and divorced in November 2008. They had 
four children during the marriage, all of whom are now adults. The record contains no 
information about the reasons for her marital breakup. 
 
 Applicant and her then husband received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 
1993. The discharged debts included medical bills, credit card accounts, and a 
delinquent home loan. (GX 3 at 5.) The record contains minimal information about the 
circumstances leading up to the bankruptcy. 
 
 
3 
 
 Applicant’s testified that her current debts arose after her divorce because she 
did not earn enough by herself to pay her credit card debts and her student loans. (GX 3 
at 3; Tr. 42-43.) She receives no alimony or spousal support from her ex-husband. (Tr. 
44.) She incurred unreimbursed moving expenses of about $2,000 in April 2008, $3,000 
in May 2011, and $2,500 in January 2013. The April 2008 and January 2013 moves 
were to take another position with the same employer, but at a different geographical 
location. (GX 1 at 16-21; Tr. 44-45.)  
 
At the hearing, Applicant admitted that some of her debts were the result of bad 
decisions, such as spending about $5,000 for several cosmetic treatments, as alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.e. (GX 3 at 6, 17; Tr. 61-62.) She admitted incurring credit card and other 
debts without considering the long-term consequences. (Tr. 56.) The evidence 
concerning the status of the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (medical bill for $657). This debt arose because of an emergency 
room visit and was referred for collection in August 2008. In response to DOHA 
interrogatories in November 2012, Applicant stated that she intended to use a retention 
bonus to pay this bill in December 2012. (GX 3 at 17.) It is unpaid. (GX 4 at 1; Tr. 36.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b (cable bill for $106). This debt was referred for collection in April 
2011. In response to DOHA interrogatories in November 2012, Applicant stated that she 
intended to pay this bill with her retention bonus in December 2012. It is unpaid. (GX 4 
at 1; Tr. 36.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c (collection account for rent $1,961). This debt was incurred when 
Applicant was laid off and gave her landlord a 30-day notice that she was moving. The 
amount of the debt is the fee for terminating the lease. It was referred for collection in 
January 2010 and is unpaid. In response to DOHA interrogatories in November 2012, 
she stated that she disputed this debt, but she submitted no documentation of the basis 
for the dispute or its resolution. (GX 3 at 17; GX 4 at 1; Tr. 36.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d (collection account for $4,667). This debt is a delinquent credit card 
account. It was referred for collection in January 2008 and is unpaid. (GX 3 at 17; GX 4 
at 2; Tr. 37-38.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e (collection account for $5,920). This debt for cosmetic treatments 
was referred for collection in February 2008. It is unpaid. (GX 3 at 6, 17; GX 4 at 2; Tr. 
38.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f (student loan charged off for $2,084). Applicant testified that she is 
paying about $300 per month on her student loans, and she initially thought this student 
loan was included in her payments. She testified that she contacted the creditor and 
confirmed that this loan is not included in her student loan payments. She has not taken 
any steps to include it in her other payments. (GX 5 at 2; Tr. 39-41.) 
 
 
4 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g (credit card for $1,924). This debt was charged off in July 2008. It is 
unpaid. (GX 3 at 17; GX 4 at 2; Tr. 41.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h (medical bill for $3,496). This debt was referred for collection in April 
2011. It is unpaid. (GX 3 at 17; GX 6 at 20; Tr. 42.) 
 
 After receiving but before responding to DOHA financial interrogatories, Applicant 
contacted the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.h in October 2012, but she was 
not able to settle the debts. She attributed her lack of success to insufficient income. 
(GX 3 at 17.) She has not contacted any creditors alleged in the SOR since October 
2012. (Tr. 37.)  
 
Applicant currently has seven student loans with a total balance of about 
$29,108. (AX A; AX B.) About $15,000 of this balance is attributable to her children’s 
education, and the remainder is attributable to her. (Tr. 60.) In March 2009, she 
resolved a delinquent car loan by voluntarily surrendering the car. In May 2011, she 
paid off several student loans by withdrawing money from her retirement account. She 
owes federal taxes and penalties of about $20,000 for the early withdrawals from her 
retirement account. (GX 3 at 8, 13; Tr. 45.) She has been negotiating a resolution of her 
tax debt and expects to be required to pay between $400 and $500 per month. (Tr. 48-
49.) These debts are not alleged in the SOR. 
 
 Applicant submitted a personal financial statement to DOHA in November 2012. 
She listed net monthly income of $2,530, expenses of $1,920, debt payments (three 
student loans and fees paid to a tax relief agency) of $794, and a monthly shortfall of 
$184. (GX 3 at 19.) As of the date of the hearing, she had paid off the debt to the tax 
relief agency, but her rent had increased. She testified that she lives frugally and has a 
monthly remainder of “a few hundred dollars.” (Tr. 55.) She has not yet begun payments 
on her tax debt. 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
5 
 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, including two medical bills and one 
student loan, totaling about $20,815 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h). It also alleges a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge in 1993 (SOR ¶ 1.i). The concern under this guideline is set out in 
AG ¶ 18:  
 
6 
 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). Applicant’s 
admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 
19(b) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
unresolved, and not the result of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 
7 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. Applicant provided virtually no information about 
the circumstances leading up to her bankruptcy in 1993. After the bankruptcy, she 
encountered conditions beyond her control, such as her marital break-up, a significant 
period of unemployment, and the medical emergency underlying the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a. However, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g were delinquent 
and referred for collection before her divorce and her period of unemployment. 
Furthermore, she has not acted responsibly regarding the debts alleged in the SOR. 
She contacted the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.h once in October 2012, after she 
received the DOHA interrogatories, but she made no further contacts or efforts to 
resolve the debts, even though she has been employed continuously since May 2011.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant probably was required by the 
bankruptcy court to obtain counseling in 1993, and she has obtained professional 
assistance in resolving her current tax debt, but she has not shown “clear indications” 
that her financial problems are being resolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. The “good faith” required to establish this 
mitigating condition means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 
1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort 
to resolve her student loans, but she has no plan to resolve the debts alleged in the 
SOR, and she has taken no significant steps to resolve them. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. In her response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant 
asserted that she disputed the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, but she provided no evidence 
showing the basis for her dispute or any resolution. She has not disputed the remaining 
debts alleged in the SOR.  
 
 Applicant provided minimal information regarding the circumstances leading to 
her 1993 bankruptcy discharge. She has not shown that any of the mitigating conditions 
under this guideline apply to her bankruptcy. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
8 
 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy. She has worked for defense 
contractors and held a security clearance for many years. She was candid, sincere, and 
credible at the hearing. She has shown good faith in repaying her student loans and 
appears to be committed to resolving her tax debt. However, she has a pattern of 
incurring debt without considering the consequences, and she has reacted passively to 
her current financial situation. She has not demonstrated the sense of obligation 
expected of persons entrusted with a security clearance.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on her financial situation. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
