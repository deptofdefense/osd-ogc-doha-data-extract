GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 10, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
October 17, 2012.2 On an unspecified date, the DOD issued him another set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on October 17, 2012.3 On January 
3, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as

amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 14, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
February 6, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on March 27, 2013. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2013. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 17, 2013, and I convened the hearing by video 
teleconference as scheduled on May 15, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and ten 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 23, 2013. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, 
and he submitted five additional documents which were marked as exhibits (AE K 
through AE O) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on May 
23, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a. and 1.b.) pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since April 
2011, has served as an electronics technician. He was previously employed by other 
employers as a fiber optics contractor, fiber optic technician, and restaurant manager.4 
Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Air Force Reserve from February 
1985 until August 1997, and received an honorable discharge.5 He was called to active 
duty on several occasions, including a January 1991 deployment for Operation Desert 
Storm.6

During his military service he was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal, 
the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service Award (with one 
device), the Air Reserve Meritorious Service Medal (with two devices), the Air Force 
Training Ribbon, the Southwest Asia Service Medal (with one device), the National 
Defense Service Medal, the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Rifle), the 
Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, the Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award (with four devices), and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.7 
Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in 1985.8  
 
A 1985 high school graduate, Applicant attended a junior college from October 
1985 until June 1987, but did not receive a degree.9 He was married the first time in 
February 1991, divorced in August 1993, and married the second time in August 2009, 
and divorced in May 2012.10 He and his first wife have one son, born in August 1991. 
 
Financial Considerations 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
February 2008. During the years leading up to that point, he was essentially debt free.11 
Applicant’s second wife, with whom he resided for 14 years before they got married,12 
was a recovering alcoholic with a gambling problem, working at a casino and then at a 
small restaurant. She stole alcohol from the restaurant, and there was apparently a 
mutual agreement that she would leave her job.13 Applicant travelled often with his job, 
and he was unable to pay sufficient attention to his finances.14 His girlfriend, who later 
became his second wife, had no credit in her name, and Applicant permitted her to use 
his accounts. Without his knowledge or permission, she drained funds from Applicant’s 
individual accounts, forged his name on checks, obtained cash advances, hid funds to 
use for purchasing alcohol and gambling, and “maxed out” the balances of other 
accounts in Applicant’s name.15 In December 2009, his second wife was convicted of 
driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and Applicant incurred a bill of $3,100 which 
he paid on her behalf. When the economy started to stagnate, his earnings 
diminished.16 With insufficient funds to continue covering her expenses and making his

monthly payments, his accounts became delinquent, were placed for collection, charged 
off, or went to judgment. 
Applicant and his second wife separated in April 2011.17 In an effort to reduce 
expenses and stabilize his financial situation, he moved in with his mother, to whom he 
does not pay rent, but for whom he pays utilities and does work around the house.18 He 
contacted his creditors, but because of the large amounts they required to resolve the 
accounts, he was not able to immediately attempt to pay them. He developed a 
repayment plan, withdrew funds from his 401(k) retirement account, and sold his truck. 
With those funds and his salary, he started paying his creditors.19 He complied with the 
marital settlement agreement that was incorporated into the divorce decree, and paid off 
and gave his second wife title to an automobile, paid her $2,000 in alimony, $750 in 
legal fees, and $990 for health insurance.20 With time and effort, Applicant was able to 
dig himself out of the financial hole largely created by his second wife.21 Applicant was 
able to address the remaining accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they have 
either been settled, paid off, or are in the process of being paid.22  With the exception of 
one account which is currently in a repayment plan, Applicant has no other delinquent 
accounts.23 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial 
statement reflecting a monthly net salary of $2,975.92; monthly household, utility, 
transportation, and food expenses of $1,552; and monthly debt repayments of $565; 
leaving a monthly remainder of $858.92.24 Although there have been some changes in 
the various line items, with some expenses no longer existing, and some increasing, 
Applicant estimates that his monthly remainder is still about $800.25   
The SOR identified two purportedly continuing delinquencies. There is a credit 
card account with a credit limit of $6,900 and an unpaid balance of $7,316 that was 
placed for collection and charged off (SOR ¶ 1.a.).26 Although the attorney representing 
the creditor has referred to the account as a final judgment,27 there is no other evidence

to confirm that assertion. Applicant had repeatedly attempted to resolve the account, but 
the creditor required a payment in full, something Applicant was unable to do at the 
time.28 On February 12, 2013, the creditor agreed to settle the account for $4,920, 
provided monthly payments of $820 were made commencing on or before the 25th day 
of the month.29 Applicant made his first payment on February 25, 2013, and made 
subsequent payments in March and April 2013.30 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account with a credit limit of $13,500, a past due balance of 
$2,222, and an unpaid balance of $13,141 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).31 After numerous unsuccessful 
attempts to resolve the account,32 in March 2013, Applicant and the creditor finally 
agreed to settle the account for $8,000, and that payment was received by the creditor 
on March 29, 2013.33 The account has been resolved. 
 
Applicant has never received any financial counseling. Nevertheless, now that 
his formerly delinquent accounts have been settled, paid off, or are in the process of 
being paid, Applicant’s financial problems have been resolved and his finances are 
under control. 
  
Work Performance and Character References 
 
 Applicant’s work performance and character have been described by senior 
company officials in extremely positive terms. The facility security officer, project 
manager, and the chief of the section, all refer to his integrity, maturity, dedication, 
resolve, reliability, trustworthiness, upbeat attitude, dependability, and work ethic. 
Applicant is considered an integral part of the teams deployed all over the world.34 A 
former coworker, who has known Applicant since 2008, characterized him as loyal, 
honest, considerate, and supportive.35 He also was aware of Applicant’s financial 
situation, and stated that Applicant “was always focused on paying his bills and trying to 
get himself out of debt. Just when things would be going his way, [Applicant’s second 
wife] would start drinking and spending money. [Applicant] was always trying to fix the

negative situations [Applicant’s second wife] would get herself into.”36 A friend of 
Applicant’s mother has known Applicant for approximately 30 years, and she was aware 
of his marriages, finances, and family activities. She is now retired after a career in the 
banking industry. She considers Applicant to be trustworthy.37 A high school classmate, 
who is now a master-level mental health therapist, has kept in touch with Applicant over 
the years, and they have shared life’s events. She considers Applicant to be fair, 
generous, frugal, responsible, and dependable, with a strong sense of duty.38 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and 
has emphasized that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”39 As Commander in 
Chief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to 
have access to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified 
information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
do so.”40   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”41 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
 
7 
                                      
 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.42  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”43 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”44 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

 Cir. 1994).

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2008, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties, and over the next few years those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or went to 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.45  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s indebtedness was not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. 
Instead, his financial problems were caused by circumstances largely beyond his 
control. Without his knowledge or permission, Applicant’s second wife drained funds 
from his individual accounts, forged his name on checks, obtained cash advances, hid 
funds to use for purchasing alcohol and gambling, and “maxed out” the balances of 
                                                          
45
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

other accounts in Applicant’s name. When the economy started to stagnate, his 
earnings diminished, and he had insufficient funds to continue covering his second 
wife’s expenses and making his monthly payments. Applicant and his second wife 
separated, and in an effort to reduce expenses, and get his financial situation stabilized, 
he moved in with his mother. He contacted his creditors, developed a repayment plan, 
withdrew funds from his 401(k) retirement account, and sold his truck. With those funds 
and his salary, he started paying his creditors. He complied with the marital settlement 
agreement that was incorporated into the divorce decree. With time and effort, Applicant 
was able to dig himself out of the financial hole largely created by his second wife. 
Applicant was able to address the remaining accounts, including non-SOR accounts, 
and they have either been settled, paid off, or are in the process of being paid.46  With 
the exception of one account which is currently in a repayment plan, Applicant has no 
other delinquent accounts. While Applicant never received any financial counseling, his 
financial problems have been resolved and his finances are under control. Furthermore, 
now that Applicant has divorced his second wife, her actions can no longer impact his 
finances. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.47 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
                                                          
46
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.48       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
permitted his second wife to gain access to his accounts, knowing she was an alcoholic 
and a gambler. As a direct result of her actions, a number of accounts became 
delinquent. As a result, accounts were placed for collection or went to judgment.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. A 
veteran of the Gulf War, Applicant is highly thought of by his colleagues and friends. His 
indebtedness was not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not 
spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were caused by the actions of 
his second wife. He contacted his creditors, developed a repayment plan, gathered his 
available assets, and started paying his creditors. Applicant’s delinquent accounts have 
either been settled, paid off, or are in the process of being paid.  His financial problems 
have been resolved and his finances are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:49 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his [or her] 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(“Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to

Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶¶ 2(a)(1) through AG  2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
