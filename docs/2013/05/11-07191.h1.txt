FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on October 28, 2010. On 
October 15, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on November 27, 2012 and requested a 
determination on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the 
Government’s written case on February 15, 2013. On February 20, 2013, a complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
 2
Government’s evidence. Included with the FORM was an amendment to the SOR, 
adding two additional allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q). Applicant received the FORM 
and amended SOR on March 8, 2013; and she responded on April 4, 2013. The case 
was assigned to me on April 23, 2013.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 
and 1.k. She denied the remaining allegations. Her admissions are incorporated in my 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 59-year-old senior software configuration analyst employed by a 
defense contractor since September 2000. She was laid off from a previous job in June 
2000 and was unemployed until she began her current job. Her current job pays about 
$20,000 less than her previous job. (Item 3 at 1.) Since October 2004, she also has 
worked as a part-time, self-employed representative of a private company. She earned 
a bachelor’s degree in 1976. She has held a security clearance since February 2001.  
 
 Applicant married in September 1974. She and her husband have two adult 
sons. In a personal subject interview (PSI) in November 2010, she told an investigator 
that her husband began having serious health problems in 2000. He became disabled 
and medically retired in 2004, causing him to lose his “tax business”1 and his job as a 
high school teacher and coach. He was diagnosed with a degenerative disease in 2007. 
His illness caused unexpected bills for medical care and prescription drugs. (Item 5 at 
5.) For reasons unrelated to his illness, they failed to file timely federal and state tax 
returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010. The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the 
SOR is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (Chapter 7 bankruptcy). Applicant and her husband filed a joint 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2005, because their reduced income and 
increased medical expenses caused them to fall behind on their house payments and 
other financial obligations. They listed assets of $257,481 and liabilities of $374,078. 
They received a discharge in November 2005. (Item 5 at 4.)  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f (medical bills for $275 and $400). Department Counsel 
conceded that these two bills are for the same debt. (FORM at 5.) On April 1, 2013, 
Applicant made a $25 payment on this debt pursuant to a payment agreement, leaving 
a balance due of about $227. (Response to FORM, SOR ¶ 1.b Exhibit.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c (collection account for $405). Applicant paid this debt in full on April 
13, 2013. (Response to FORM, SOR ¶ 1.c Exhibit.) 
 
                                                          
1 The nature of the “tax business” is not clear. If Applicant’s husband was an experienced tax preparer, 
then it is more likely that Applicant and her husband understood the consequences of failing to timely file 
their tax returns. 
 
 3
 SOR ¶ 1.d (non-medical account for $690, charged off in January 2010.) 
Applicant admitted this debt in her answer to the SOR and stated that she would contact 
the creditor after her tax liability payments were determined. She has submitted no 
evidence of a payment agreement, any payments, or any attempts to contact the 
creditor. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e (medical collection account for $1,965). Applicant began making 
monthly $84 payments on this debt in May 2011. Her most recent payment was on 
March 29, 2013, leaving a balance of $96. (Response to FORM, SOR ¶ 1.e Exhibit.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g (medical bill for $341). Applicant’s November 2010 credit report 
reflected that this debt was paid. (Item 9 at 108.2) 
  
 SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.n (medical bill for $725 and collection account for $1,966). 
Department Counsel conceded that SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.n pertain to the same debt. 
(FORM at 5.) Applicant asserts that these debts are included in SOR ¶ 1.e, discussed 
above. (Item 3 at 2; Response to FORM, Table at 2.) The invoice from the creditor 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n reflects that the current creditor is the same creditor as alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.e and the debt is within one dollar of the amount alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. I 
conclude that SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.n are included in SOR ¶ 1.e.  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j (collection accounts for $497 and $808). These debts were 
included in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Item 7 at 3; Item 9 at 108-09.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k (non-medical collection account for $707). Applicant admitted this 
debt in her answer to the SOR. She stated that she had contacted the creditor and 
intended to begin making payments once her tax liability was determined. She has 
submitted no evidence of a payment agreement or any payments. The debt is 
unresolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l (medical bill for $850). Applicant submitted evidence of monthly 
$57.22 payments from December 2012 to March 2013. (Response to FORM, SOR ¶ 1.l 
Exhibit.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m (property damage to rental property, $4,500). After receiving a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant and her husband attempted to negotiate a 
loan modification on their home but were unsuccessful. The mortgage on their home 
was foreclosed in January 2008, and they moved into a rental property. In November 
2008, Applicant’s husband’s doctor failed to timely file his disability certification, causing 
her husband’s disability payments for November and December 2008 to be delayed. 
They were evicted for non-payment of rent in December 2008, and they moved into 
another rental property, where they now reside. Their landlord who evicted them 
claimed that they had caused damage worth $40,000 to the property. They negotiated a 
settlement for $3,735.21, which they paid in monthly $250 installments. They overpaid 
the amount of the settlement by about $515, requested a refund of the overpayment, 
                                                          
2 The pagination of Item 9 begins with page 101.

and found that the landlord had filed a petition for bankruptcy and listed them as a 
creditor for the amount of the overpayment. (Item 5 at 5; FORM Response Exhibits 2 
and 3.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.o, 1.p, 1.q (failure to file federal and state income tax returns; 
federal tax debt of $25,463; state tax debt of $4,787). In a personal subject interview 
(PSI) in November 2010, Applicant told the investigator that she and her husband were 
unable to timely file their 2008 income tax returns because her husband’s computer 
malfunctioned, causing them to lose their tax data. She stated that they were also 
unable to timely file their 2009 returns because they still had not retrieved their tax data. 
She told the investigator that they had filed requests for extension of time to file their 
returns for 2008 and 2009. (Item 5 at 4.) However, the record contains no 
documentation of any requests for extensions. Applicant has submitted no explanation 
for failing to timely file her 2010 return.  
 
In response to DOHA interrogatories on June 11, 2012, Applicant stated that they 
had filed their federal and state income tax returns through tax year 2007 and were in 
the process of completing the returns for the remaining years. (Item 6 at 2.) Applicant’s 
response to the DOHA interrogatories indicates that she filed her tax returns at some 
time after June 11, 2012. The IRS billing notices sent to Applicant in October 2012 
reflect that a failure-to-file penalty was assessed in addition to the failure-to-pay penalty 
for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 returns, indicating that the returns were not filed by the 
due date or within any extensions of time to file. The failure-to-file penalties for 2008, 
2009, and 2010 total $3,649, the failure-to-pay penalties total $2,335, and the accrued 
interest totals $1,650. (Item 3 at 10, 11, and 12.) The IRS billing notice for 2011 
assessed a $76 failure-to-pay penalty and $35 in interest, but no failure-to-file penalty, 
indicating that the 2011 return was timely filed. (Item 3 at 13.)  
 
On November 20, 2012, shortly before Applicant answered the SOR, she and her 
husband made a payment agreement with the state providing for monthly $133.67 
payments, and they made the required payments in December 2012 through March 
2013. (Response to FORM, SOR ¶ 1.q Exhibits 1 and 2.) In January 2013, Applicant 
and her husband made a payment agreement with the IRS for the taxes due for 2008 
through 2011, providing for monthly $350 payments. They made a $1,000 payment in 
January 2013, and $350 payments in February and March 2013. (Response to FORM, 
SOR ¶ 1.p Exhibits 1 and 2.) 
 
 The record does not contain a personal financial statement from Applicant. 
However, the unsigned and undated copies of tax returns submitted with Applicant’s 
answer to the SOR reflect that Applicant and her husband had gross income of $91,230 
in 2008; $93,930 in 2009; $90,813 in 2010; and $93,878 in 2011. (Item 3 at 15-45.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
 
 5
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
 
 6
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The amended SOR alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a), 13 delinquent 
debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.n), failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
2008 to 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.o), a federal tax debt (SOR ¶ 1.p), and a state tax debt (SOR ¶ 
1.q.). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially 
applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Department Counsel conceded that the delinquent debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b 
duplicates the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h duplicates 
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n. Applicant’s evidence in response to the FORM reflects 
that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.n are included in SOR ¶ 1.e. When the same 
conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, the duplicative 
allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. 
 
 7
Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Thus, I will resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 
and 1.n in Applicant’s favor, and they will not be discussed further in the analysis below. 
 
 Applicant’s admissions in her answer to the SOR, her admissions during the PSI, 
and the credit bureau reports and bankruptcy records submitted by Department Counsel 
establish AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). The tax records and Applicant’s response to DOHA 
interrogatories reflect failure to timely file federal and state tax returns for 2008, 2009, 
and 2010, thereby establishing AG ¶ 19(g).  
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous and not 
yet resolved. Her husband’s illness and disability were circumstances that are unlikely 
to recur, but their impact on her financial situation is continuing.  
 
 The first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) (conditions beyond Applicant’s control) is 
established by the evidence of Applicant’s temporary unemployment and subsequent 
reduction in income in 2000, her husband’s illness and disability that caused loss of 
income and medical expenses, the interruption of her husband’s disability payments, 
and the malfunction of their personal computer containing their 2008 tax data. The 
second prong (responsible conduct) is established for the bankruptcy alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.a and the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j, which were included in the bankruptcy. 
It is established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, 1.l, and 1.m, which are paid or 
are being resolved by payment plans.  
 
 However, the second prong of AG ¶ 20(b) is not established for SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 
1.d, 1.k, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. Applicant took no action to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
and 1.c until she received the FORM. In her answer to the SOR, she stated that she 
would contact the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.k when her tax liability was determined. 
 
 8
However, she presented no evidence of attempts to contact the creditors, payments, or 
payment agreements in her April 2013 response to the FORM, even though her federal 
tax liability was determined in October 2012, her state tax payments were determined in 
November 2012, and her federal tax payments were determined in January 2013. 
Applicant has not adequately explained why the loss of 2008 tax data prevented her 
from timely filing her tax returns in 2009 and 2010. While Applicant offered a plausible 
and reasonable explanation for not filing the 2008 returns on time, she has not 
explained why she did not file the 2008, 2009, and 2010 returns until after she 
responded to the DOHA interrogatories on June 12, 2012. Even if she was unable to 
pay the tax due for those years, she could have avoided the failure-to-file penalties by 
timely filing in 2009 and 2010 and seeking a payment plan for the taxes due.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant presented no evidence of financial 
counseling, although it likely was required in connection with her Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
in 2005. She has paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, and 1.m. She is making payments 
on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, 1.l, 1.p, and 1.q. However, she has not shown that the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.k are being resolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) requires a “good-faith” effort to resolve debts. Good faith means 
acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty 
or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 
1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under 
pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required, as a matter of law, to 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a 
plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR 
be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the bankruptcy alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a 
and the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ in 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m. It is not established for 
the debts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d and 1.k, which are unresolved. The timing of the 
payments on the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, the filing of the tax returns for 
2009 through 2010, and the payment plans for the tax debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 
1.q indicates that Applicant was motivated more by concern for protecting her security 
clearance than by a sense of obligation. Thus, I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is not 
established for the failure to timely file tax returns for 2008 through 2010 and for the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, 1.p, and 1.q. 
 
 
 9
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment.  
 
 Applicant has worked for defense contractors and held a security clearance for 
many years. Her husband’s illness and disability caused them a serious financial 
setback. She initially acted responsibly to resolve their debts through bankruptcy and 
attempted to save their home from foreclosure. However, she has not acted responsibly 
regarding her federal and state taxes and several delinquent debts. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the 
evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude she has 
not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.j:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l-1.n:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o-1.q:    Against Applicant 
 
 10
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
