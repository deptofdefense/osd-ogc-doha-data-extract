GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 4, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
August 29, 2012.2 On October 15, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 23, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
November 8, 2012,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have 
his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on March 21, 
2013, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the 
FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant received the FORM on March 27, 2013, but, as of May 23, 2013, he had not 
submitted a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one (¶ 1.a.) of the two factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since March 
2011, has been serving as a quality assurance specialist.4 He previously worked for 
other employers as a restaurant server, freelance writer, scoring evaluator, associate 
editor, sales associate, student assistant, copy editor, cashier, and sandwich artist.5 He 
is a May 2004 high school graduate and a May 2008 college graduate with a bachelor’s 
degree in journalism.6 He has never served in the U.S. military,7 and has never been 
married.8 Applicant has never been granted a security clearance.9

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties, 
although there are some indications that those problems may have started as early as 
2009 when he failed to file his 2008 federal income tax return. The SOR identified three 
purportedly continuing delinquencies.  
 
There is a credit card account with a high credit of $10,040 and an unpaid 
balance of approximately $11,500 that was past due, charged off, and placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.a.).10 Applicant had used the credit card for routine purchases, but 
in March 2010, he fell behind in his monthly payments. A collection agent contacted him 
in February 2011, and a settlement offer was made to Applicant under which the debt 
(which was then for $11,202) would be settled for $6,721, provided Applicant started 
making payments by April 2011. No agreement was reached because Applicant was 
unable to pay the required amount.11 The collection agent filed a lawsuit against 
Applicant, alleging breach of contract, and Applicant’s attorney was able to have the suit 
dismissed on a motion to dismiss when the collection agent failed to appear.12 
Applicant’s position is that the creditor has refused to offer him a “reasonable payment 
plan/settlement offer,” and since the negative account information is already on his 
credit report, he “will be taking no further action in regard to this issue.”13 Although 
Applicant had previously indicated he was trying to negotiate affordable terms with the 
creditor to satisfy the debt,14 he has submitted no documentation to support his claim, 
and there is no other evidence that Applicant made any effort to resolve this account. 
The account remains unresolved. 
 
As noted above, Applicant failed to file his 2008 federal income tax return as 
required by law (SOR ¶ 1.b.). There is no evidence that the return was filed by the 
established April 2009 deadline or by any approved deadline extension.15 Applicant

 The willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, is covered by 26 USC § 7203:   
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by 
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any 
information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction 
thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned 
not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.

claimed that he was employed by a startup company that failed to properly handle 
payroll and taxes, and that he had been made an independent contractor with a Form 
1099 rather than an employee with a W-2. He also disputed the earnings received, as 
well as an assessment by “someone who reviewed his earnings” that he owed $1,300 in 
federal tax, an amount he was unable to pay.16 Applicant did not identify the individual 
who furnished that assessment, or indicate that individual’s expertise. In August 2012, 
16 months after being interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2008. The return 
reflected an adjusted gross income of $9,079. Penalties were assessed for filing a tax 
return after the due date ($135), late payment of tax ($52.60), and interest for late 
payment ($52.10).17 The account has been resolved. 
 
Applicant failed to file his 2009 federal income tax return as required by law 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.). There is no evidence that the return was filed by the established April 
2010 deadline or by any approved deadline extension, another potential violation of 26 
USC § 7203. Applicant claimed that his employers failed to furnish him either a Form 
1099 or a W-2. He contended that without those documents, he was unable to file his 
federal income tax return.18 This account has not been resolved. 
 
In August 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
net monthly income of $2,500. He claimed $800 in monthly expenses, with zero debt 
payments or rent payments, leaving $1,700 for discretionary spending or savings. He 
also indicated $6,000 in bank savings.19 Applicant has never received financial 
counseling.20 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”21 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”22   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”23 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.24  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”25

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”26 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In addition, AG ¶ 19(g), failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same, may raise security 
concerns. Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for 2008 and 2009, as 
required by law. He also was unable to initially pay his credit card, but now that he is 
able to pay it, he has refused to do so. His financial difficulties remain unresolved. AG 
¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce

or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.27  
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e), do not apply, and AG ¶ 20(d) minimally 
applies. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties since 2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was 
so infrequent.” In light of his continuing inability to resolve his 2009 income tax issues 
and his refusal to resolve the delinquent credit card account without terms more 
favorable to him, Applicant’s financial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the short 
term, and they are likely to continue. He has never received financial counseling, and 
his dispute with the credit card creditor is seemingly without a reasonable basis. While 
Applicant has contended his income tax difficulties were caused by the actions of his 
employers in either furnishing him a Form 1099 rather than a W-2, or furnishing him 
neither form, it is difficult to attribute Applicant’s failures to file his income tax returns as 
required by law to conditions that were largely beyond Applicant’s control. The 
responsibility to file is the taxpayer’s alone, and Applicant’s dispute over correct 
paperwork is no justification for his failure to file on time. Applicant’s eventual filing of his 
2008 federal income tax return in 2012, after so much time where little positive efforts 
were taken, especially since he had sufficient funds to do so, does not qualify as a 
“good-faith” effort. Accordingly, Applicant failed to mitigate his financial situation, and 
under the circumstances, his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.28   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                                          
27
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.29       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: He finally filed 
his 2008 federal income tax return in 2012. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant failed to file his 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns as required by law. 
There was no evidence that the returns were filed by the established April deadlines or 
by any approved deadline extensions. He attributed his income tax difficulties to the 
actions of his employers in either furnishing him a Form 1099 rather than a W-2, or 
furnishing him neither form. Applicant’s actions were violations of 26 USC § 7203. 
 
Applicant used his credit card, but was eventually unable to maintain his monthly 
payments. His position with regard to the delinquent credit card is that the creditor has 
refused to offer him a “reasonable payment plan/settlement offer,” and since the 
negative account information is already on his credit report, he “will be taking no further 
action in regard to this issue.” Applicant could have made some more reasonable timely 
efforts to file his income tax returns and resolve his delinquent credit card account, but 
he has not done so. Applicant has demonstrated the absence of a meaningful track 
record in addressing his delinquent credit card account or his federal income tax return- 
filing responsibilities. Applicant’s actions indicate a lack of judgment, which raises 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
