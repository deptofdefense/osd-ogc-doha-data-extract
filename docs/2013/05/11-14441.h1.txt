GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 26, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories 
on July 13, 2012.2 On September 12, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining

Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on September 20, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
September 26, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on October 31, 2012. The case was initially assigned to 
Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro on November 13, 2012, and reassigned to 
Administrative Judge Robert Tuider on November 20, 2012. It was reassigned to me on 
January 4, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 17, 2013, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on February 11, 2013.3 
 
During the hearing, 8 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 8) and 25 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE Y) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 20, 2013. 
I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity, and on February 22, 2013, he submitted 28 additional documents.4 AE 
Z through AE AAA) were admitted into evidence without objection. One additional 
document was submitted on May 8, 2013, and admitted into evidence (AE BBB) without 
objection. The record closed on May 8, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.), and one of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct (¶ 2.c.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He previously 
served with various employers as a base expeditionary target surveillance system

 At the close of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, Department Counsel offered no rebuttal, and 
arguments were about to commence, when Applicant’s attorney noted that the courthouse was about to close. The 
parties were given the opportunity to make oral argument at another segment of the hearing or to submit written 
arguments. The parties eventually chose to submit written arguments, and those submissions were received in April 
2013. 
 
4
 Some of Applicant’s post-hearing submissions were mismarked by him as exhibits P through QQ, but he 
failed to realize that AE P through AE Y were already admitted into evidence during the hearing, and the newly 
proposed P through Y were not duplicates of those exhibits already in evidence. Accordingly, to avoid confusion, I 
have remarked several of the proposed exhibits as follows: Proposed exhibits P through Y have been remarked as 
AE RR through AE AAA, respectively. AE Z through AE AAA) were admitted into evidence without objection.

operator, operations program manager, supply clerk, and information systems quality 
assurance and quality control. For nine years he was an information technology (IT) 
technician and owner of a company.5 He served on active duty with the U.S. Army in an 
enlisted status from September 1987 until June 1988; and with the National Guard from 
1990 until 1992 or 1993.6 He received honorable discharges. He received a top secret 
security clearance in 1987.7 Applicant graduated from high school in June 1987. He was 
married in 1992, and he has two daughters (born in 1988 and 1999, respectively) and a 
son (born in 1992). 
 
Financial Considerations 
Applicant’s 2011 credit report indicates that a tax lien was filed against him in 
2002; an account was periodically past due in and before 2006; and various collection 
actions were taken through the ensuing years.8 Nevertheless, he attributed his financial 
difficulties to “a slowing economy” in 2006.9 From 2003 to 2008, Applicant owned a 
business that specialized in security systems, custom home theatres, and cable and 
satellite installation and service. The business owned several vehicles and had a sales 
team. When the economy started to decline, many of the vendors he depended on for 
work slowed or stopped his company’s installation services. Unable to secure other 
contracts or gainful employment, he was eventually unable to meet his monthly 
business expenses, operating costs, and household payments, and accounts became 
delinquent, and were either placed for collection or charged off. Vehicles were 
repossessed.10 Because of the equity he had built up in some of the vehicles, when they 
were auctioned off, there were no deficiency balances.11  
Applicant contacted a number of his creditors and collection agents regarding his 
delinquent accounts, tried to seek validation of those accounts, and tried to work out 
repayment arrangements for those accounts he recognized. He also disputed a number 
of accounts for various reasons, including those with creditors that he did not recognize, 
and unauthorized charges or debits. A number of such disputed accounts were 
subsequently either corrected or removed from his credit reports.12 Applicant was able

 Applicant disputed a number of accounts for various reasons, and the credit reporting agencies responded 
to his disputes. Unfortunately, the responses directed him to view the details on their website, and did not identify the 
accounts in question, or indicate the actual results. Applicant’s attorney submitted those superficial responses, but 
failed to connect the accounts to the disputes or share the results of those disputes, except to provide confirmation 
numbers for the disputes. The documentation submitted as “evidence” is virtually useless for any purpose except to 
confirm a dispute was filed. See  AE Z (E-mail from Equifax, dated April 28, 2012); AE AA (E-mail from Experian,

to resolve several other accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they have either 
been settled, paid off, or were in the process of being paid.  
 
Applicant completed financial management training in creating wealth, building 
savings, controlling debt, consumer strategies, managing income and expenses, credit 
reports, setting goals and priorities, and money and values.13 He also engaged the 
services of a company to monitor the information appearing in his credit reports, 
whether it was new inquiries, new account openings, or delinquencies.14  
In response to the DOD interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial 
statement reflecting a monthly combined family net income of $13,000; monthly 
household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $1,400; and monthly debt 
(mortgage, automobile financing, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) payments of 
$1,900; leaving a monthly remainder of $9,700.15 He listed total assets of $27,000.16  In 
January 2013, he submitted another personal financial statement reflecting a monthly 
combined family net income of $8,000; monthly household, utility, transportation, and 
food expenses of $1,200; and monthly debt payments of $1,350; leaving a monthly 
remainder of $5,500.17 He listed total assets of $120,000, including $8,000 in savings.18   
The SOR identified 12 purportedly continuing delinquencies. Those accounts are 
either already paid off, in the process of being resolved, or otherwise already resolved 
or removed from his credit reports. There is very limited evidence of payments by 
Applicant. 
  
There is a federal tax lien entered against Applicant in October 2002 in the 
amount of $4,583.14 (SOR & 1.a.).19 The lien arose over a dispute that occurred in 
1995, when Applicant was on his way to purchase some property in another state with 
$26,000 in cash derived from savings and the sale of a motor vehicle. He was stopped 
by police and the funds were confiscated. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
dated July 3, 2012); AE CC (E-mail from Equifax, dated January 30, 2013); AE EE (E-mail from Equifax, dated

appearing in AE P (Equifax Report, dated February 6, 2013).

confiscated the money and levied tax on the funds.20 Applicant hired an attorney to 
resolve the issue, but it took over a decade to do so. Applicant contended he had paid 
the tax prior to the money being returned to him, but it remained on his credit report.21 
The lien was finally “self-released” on September 25, 2012.22 Department Counsel has 
argued that the lien was released because the IRS chose not to refile the lien, and not 
because the lien amount was paid by Applicant.23 She is correct, but under the 
circumstances, the release of the lien, whether it was through payment or dispute, 
cannot be discounted. The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a loan with a bank for about $24,000 to finance the purchase of a motor 
vehicle used in Applicant’s business. The vehicle was subsequently repossessed with a 
remaining balance of about $9,000. It was sold at auction, leaving a deficiency of less 
than $800.24 Applicant provided several inconsistent explanations for the delinquency 
and how it was subsequently handled. He said he was under the impression that the 
balance had been written off, but then stated that when he called the creditor to pay the 
remaining balance, the creditor declined to accept the payment because the account 
had been charged off.25 Applicant later disputed the $9,000 balance, claiming he had 
paid the creditor $3,000 after the vehicle was repossessed to resolve the issue.26 He 
offered no documentation to support his contention that he had paid the $3,000 or that 
the account had been resolved. The account was placed for collection and transferred 
or sold, in turn, to two collection agents or debt buyers who initially reported the 
outstanding balance was $10,226.27 The unpaid balance was increased one year later 
to $12,017 (SOR & 1.b.).28 Applicant sought validation of the account with the collection 
agent,29 and disputed the account with both the collection agent and Equifax. The initial 
collection agent acknowledged the information it furnished the credit reporting agencies 
was inaccurate.30 The current collection agent ceased collection efforts and closed the

 A lien usually releases automatically 10 years after a tax is assessed, if the statutory period for collection 
has not been extended and the IRS does not extend the effect of the lien by refiling it. When a lien is self-released, 
the Notice of Federal Tax Lien itself is the release document. A lien is self-released if the date for refiling has passed 
and the IRS has not refiled the original Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See IRS Publication 1468 (Rev. 3-2010), at 3.

account.31  While there is no evidence that Applicant paid the deficiency balance, the 
account has been resolved. 
 
There is an account with a rental company from which Applicant rented vehicle 
parts for his business. There was an unpaid balance of $4,390 that was placed for 
collection, and sold to a factoring company (SOR & 1.c.).32 Applicant attempted to 
validate the account with the factoring company, but that attempt was unsuccessful 
when his letter was returned as “not deliverable as addressed – unable to forward.”33 
Applicant denied that he owed any balance and claimed the account had been “closed 
and satisfied,” and referred to a credit report to support his claim.34 A review of the 
credit report does not support his contention, for the account is not listed in the report. 
Applicant contended he had complied with the terms of the rental agreement when he 
returned the rented items to the vendor.35 He also said he spoke with the corporate 
office and was told the debt was a mistake and had been resolved.36 While the account 
is no longer listed in the two 2013 credit reports, Applicant has not submitted any 
documentation to support his contention that the account has been resolved. 
Nevertheless, since the basis of the SOR allegation was the unfavorable listing of the 
account in the 2012 credit report, and Department Counsel conceded that there is proof 
of resolution, I conclude the account has been resolved. 
 
There is another account with the same rental company from which Applicant 
rented vehicle parts for his business. There was an unpaid balance of $3,972 that was 
placed for collection, and sold to a factoring company (SOR & 1.d.).37 Applicant 
attempted to validate the account with the factoring company, but that attempt was also 
unsuccessful when his letter was returned as “not deliverable as addressed – unable to 
forward.”38 Applicant denied that he owed any balance and claimed the account had 
been “closed and satisfied,” and referred to a credit report to support his claim.39 A 
review of the credit report does not support his contention, for the account is not listed in 
the report. Applicant contended he had complied with the terms of the rental agreement 
when he returned the rented items to the vendor.40 He also said he spoke with the

corporate office and was told the debt was a mistake and had been resolved.41 
Applicant also argued that the two accounts were actually the same account, although 
there were separate account numbers for each account. He has submitted no 
documentation to support his position. While the account is no longer listed in the two 
2013 credit reports, Applicant has not submitted any documentation to support his 
contention that the account has been resolved. Nevertheless, since the basis of the 
SOR allegation was the unfavorable listing of the account in the 2012 credit report, and 
Department Counsel concedes that there is proof of resolution, I conclude the account 
has been resolved. 
 
There is a medical account with unidentified medical provider in the amount of 
$100 that was placed for collection (SOR & 1.e.).42 Applicant acknowledged the original 
charges were for an emergency room visit for his son, and the unpaid balance was the 
remaining co-pay.43 Applicant disputed the account information listed in his credit 
report,44 but in September 2012, he paid the $100.45 The creditor acknowledged the 
payment and instructed the credit reporting agencies to delete the account.46 The 
account has been resolved. 
 
There is a loan with a finance company for about $26,877 to finance the 
purchase of a motor vehicle. The vehicle was subsequently repossessed and sold at 
auction with a remaining balance of about $9,002 (SOR & 1.f.).47 Applicant provided 
several inconsistent explanations for the delinquency and how it was subsequently 
handled. He initially said the vehicle was purchased for his daughter,48 but later his 
attorney argued that it was a vehicle purchased for the business. Applicant also said 
that when the vehicle was sold, the original amount of the debt was satisfied.49 He told 
the OPM investigator in April 2011 that he would follow up with the creditor and if there 
was an unpaid balance he would may payment arrangements to resolve the account.50 
But first, Applicant disputed the account with Equifax.51 He offered no documentation to

support the basis for his dispute. The creditor offered to settle the account for $2,800, 
starting in October 2012,52 but later that month, the creditor reduced the settlement offer 
to $2,200, provided Applicant made 22 consecutive monthly payments of $100.53 
Applicant made several payments, for by January 2013, the remaining balance was 
$1,900.54 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
There is an account with a telephone company in the amount of $651 that was 
placed for collection (SOR & 1.g.).55 Applicant was unaware of the account, claiming he 
never had an account with that particular company.56 Applicant disputed the account, 
and it was apparently deleted from his credit reports, as the listing is no longer on the 
2012 or 2013 credit reports.57 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a bank checking account in the amount of $664 that was placed for 
collection and either transferred or sold to a collection agent (SOR & 1.h.).58 Applicant 
explained that while he was working in the Gulf region during the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina, he went to a telephone provider to purchase a cell phone. After having the 
funds debited from his account, he was informed that he could not obtain the phone with 
a number from another state. The charge was reversed, but upon arriving back in his 
home state, he discovered the account had not been credited as the vendor had 
reprocessed the charge without Applicant’s permission.59 He disputed the account with 
the credit reporting agency and the listing was deleted.60 While the account is no longer 
listed in the 2012 or the two 2013 credit reports, Applicant has not submitted any 
documentation to support his contention that the account has been resolved. 
Nevertheless, since the basis of the SOR allegation was the unfavorable listing of the 
account in the 2011 credit report, and Department Counsel conceded that there is proof 
of resolution, I conclude the account has been resolved. 
 
There is an account with a pizza shop reflecting a returned check from August

with the creditor, and in September 2012, the creditor confirmed that it was no longer 
attempting collections on the check, and was asking the credit reporting agencies to 
delete the entry.63 It appears that the debt was no longer collectable as the statute of 
limitations had expired. The account has been resolved. 
 
There is an account with an insurance company with an unpaid balance of $424 
that was placed for collection in September 2005 (SOR & 1.j.).64 The account was 
eventually transferred or sold to a collection agent. Applicant acknowledged having had 
coverage with the particular creditor, but claimed he had cancelled the coverage in favor 
of another company with more favorable rates.65 Applicant sought validation from the 
creditor,66 and the collection agent replied that it was no longer reporting the account to 
the credit reporting agencies.67 He also disputed the account with the credit reporting 
agency.68 The account is no longer listed in the 2012 or the two 2013 credit reports. 
Applicant contended the collection agent reported that the debt “was incorrect and it 
was removed,”69 but that statement is inaccurate for no such comment appears in the 
letter to which he referred. Instead, it appears that the debt was no longer collectable as 
the statute of limitations had expired. The account has been resolved. 
 
There is an account with a telephone company in the amount of $391 that was 
placed for collection (SOR & 1.k.).70 Applicant claimed he was not familiar with the 
account, claiming he “was in Afghanistan at the time this account went into collection.”71 
He subsequently indicated he was working to resolve the account in an attempt to reach 
a negotiated settlement, and if was unable to do so, he would pay the balance in full.72 
Applicant disputed the account.73 The creditor acknowledged that Applicant has a zero 
balance on an unspecified account,74 but he contends the communication refers to the

Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct 
 
There is a corporate travel card account that Applicant was issued to make 
purchases while employed by his government contractor-employer. Applicant was 
expected to use the card for food, lodging, transportation, entertainment, rental cars, 
clothing, etc., while traveling.76 Upon Applicant’s termination of employment, for 
disputed reasons as discussed further below, there was a purported outstanding 
balance on the card of $7,630.08, which allegedly included unauthorized purchases. 
There was a deduction, not otherwise described, of $2,192.99, leaving a balance of 
$5,466.09 (SOR & 1.l.).77 Applicant’s corporate director of outside the contiguous United 
States (OCONUS) Operations reported to the security manager that, based on his 
review of the travel card transactions, Applicant was in Dubai on July 31, 2011 and in 
California on August 1, 2011.78 Furthermore, as Applicant allegedly never reported to 
his theater lead at the overseas air base as instructed, those charges, and others might 
be unauthorized. Applicant’s corporate travel card account billing statement for the 
period between April 21, 2011 and August 2, 2011, reflects a $7,630.08 balance.79  
 
Applicant and a colleague were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2011. When they 
arrived in Dubai, they obtained plane tickets to a facility in Afghanistan, but the 
salesperson made a mistake and charged both tickets to Applicant’s corporate travel 
card.80 As early as June 2011, there was substantial continuing controversy regarding 
Applicant’s difficulties in obtaining a travel authorization, a travel request, a new 
common access card (CAC), timely reimbursement of past authorized expenses, and 
access to a printer/scanner to upload necessary receipts and other required 
paperwork.81 This was especially true while he was at a forward operating base, also 
referred to as a combat outpost or COP, because his CAC was expiring and he had 
limited communication availability.82 As a result, he was unable to upload the receipts

required for him to obtain reimbursement for transportation and lodging. In addition, his 
salary was “significantly” short.83 That same month, there were several e-mails between 
Applicant and various corporate personnel, including Applicant’s theatre lead and the 
travel accounting office, and between various corporate personnel regarding Applicant’s 
corporate travel card account.84 Applicant requested permission to return to the large Air 
Force base where he could resolve the various corporate travel card account issues 
and get his CAC renewed, but his theatre lead directed him not to leave his COP “for 
any reason.”85 The corporate travel accounting office acknowledged Applicant’s inability 
to upload, mail, or fax necessary paperwork, and reported the situation to Applicant’s 
corporate director of OCONUS Operations.86 Because the established company 
process for reimbursement of expenses on the corporate travel card called for the 
employee to scan and upload receipts to be sent to the company, then for the employee 
to pay the bill received from the card issuer, and then for the reimbursement to be paid 
to the employee,87 Applicant was unable to catch up to balance the account.  
 
In July 2011, Applicant and his theatre lead exchanged e-mails regarding 
Applicant’s failure to issue daily status reports and Applicant replied that 
communications, including Defense Switching Network (DSN), cell, and Internet were 
repeatedly down. Applicant was promised a scanner, but it was never sent.88 Applicant 
obtained permission from his military commander to travel down to the large Air Force 
base to resolve the various corporate travel card account issues and get his CAC 
renewed, but Applicant’s theatre lead again denied him permission to do so.89 Upon 
receiving the denial, Applicant notified his theatre lead in person that he was resigning, 
and that upon getting access to the internet and a computer, he would e-mail his 
intentions to the corporate deputy program manager of business operations and the 
corporate director of OCONUS Operations. Applicant also called the corporate deputy 
program manager of business operations and told him the two reasons for resigning 
were the unresolved payroll and transportation issues and the “ineffective leadership,” 
and sought guidance on out-processing. He was referred to someone else.90  
 
On August 2, 2011, the theatre lead informed the corporate director of OCONUS 
Operations that he had “no idea where (Applicant) is located,” and opined that Applicant 
had “been lying to [him] for quite some time about numerous things in addition to the

other items we have discussed.”91 On August 5, 2011, the theatre lead again indicated 
he had not heard from Applicant, and he intended to report Applicant as a missing 
contractor.92 On August 6, 2011, when he arrived in Dubai and gained access to a 
computer, Applicant sent his corporate director of OCONUS Operations a message:93 
 
Due to ongoing unresolved payroll and administration issues (sic), I would 
like to submit my letter of resignation. I would like to thank [various 
corporate employees] for the opportunity you all provided me to work with 
[the corporation] on the [program]. I wish you all success with current and 
future endeavors. I will proceed to out process thru [a particular office or 
contractor] and return all [corporate materials to the [corporate] office. 
 
The corporate director of OCONUS Operations forwarded the message to those 
corporate employees to which Applicant referred.94 Two days later, the corporate 
director of OCONUS Operations, essentially repeating what the theatre lead had told 
him, reported Applicant “never did report to the theatre lead . . . as instructed and left 
country without processing or without authorization.”95 On August 10, 2011, Applicant’s 
status was reported as an unfavorable incident in the Joint Personnel Adjudication 
System (JPAS), and the incident report was repeated on November 18, 2011.96  
 
On August 12, 2011, Applicant wrote the corporate offices and requested out-
processing guidance.97 He received a return message advising him to call another 
individual who would “get [Applicant] squared away.”98 Unfortunately, as Applicant 
noted, the telephone number furnished only contained nine digits.99 On September 14, 
2011, Applicant contacted corporate personnel, including the corporate director of 
OCONUS Operations, and requested guidance, which he still had not received. He 
                                                          
91
 GE 8 (E-mail, dated August 2, 2011). The theatre lead offered no examples regarding the assertion that 
Applicant had been lying to him for some time, and no statement or other evidence was offered in which the theatre 
lead disputed Applicant’s assertions regarding their relationship or that Applicant had personally informed him that he 
was resigning. This information directly contradicts the report by the theatre lead that Applicant was “supposed (sic) 
to report to work in Afghanistan but failed to report to in theatre lead. . . He did however arrive in country according to 
[military air] records.” See GE 8 (E-mail, dated August 8, 2011).

wanted resolution of the travel issues and payroll issues.100 A corporate response came 
the following day, stating that the information was being collected, that a conference call 
would be set up, and the documentation would be forwarded to Applicant.101 
 
With the exception of another unfavorable incident pertaining to the allegations 
related to the corporate travel card account placed in JPAS on March 1, 2012,102 the 
record is silent as to what occurred between September 15, 2011 and July 13, 2012. On 
that date, Applicant stated:103 
 
The purchases I made were authorized. . . . I contacted everyone in my 
supervisory chain of command and explained my inability to [unreadable] 
the documents due to the remote location. . . . I am open to any avenues 
necessary to resolve this. I have travel expenses that have not been paid 
by [the corporation], to include lodging, air fare, meals, and per diem. I 
also was not paid the 35% danger and 35% hazard pay during my 
deployment, as specified by the Department of State. I have made several 
attempts to resolve this and I am willing to do whatever is needed to 
finalize. . . . I will do whatever is necessary to resolve this. 
 
In early August 2012, Applicant called the security supervisor and “discussed the 
same items as before.” Applicant was instructed to contact the corporate legal 
department to set up a repayment plan.104 On November 1, 2012, there was still 
controversy regarding Applicant’s account and his status. Applicant stated a concern to 
the strategic human resources (HR) business partner that the JPAS entries were 
incorrect because the disputed amount had not yet been accurately determined and that 
the assertion that he had failed to report to work was false. He also noted that he was 
wrongfully denied a referral bonus.105 The strategic HR business partner also recounted 
the corporate position:106

 GE 2, supra note 96. The security supervisor reported that Applicant had made purchases that were not 
approved, and that he had terminated his employment without paying the money back or setting up a payment plan. It 
also reported that the corporate legal department had sent Applicant a collections letter, but that Applicant had still 
not made a payment or acknowledgment of the issue. There is no evidence that pre-approval of purchases was ever 
required. Other than the opinion of the security supervisor, there is little evidence to support the conclusion that the 
purchases were “not approved” or “unauthorized.” Instead, Department Counsel has argued that because the JPAS 
entry said the charges were not approved, that entry constituted evidence sufficient to prove the charges were 
unauthorized. See Tr. at 113-114. The evidence reflects merely an unpaid balance on the account. See Tr. at 110.

You were expected to report to [the theatre lead] in Afghanistan on or 
about August 2, 2012. All of the status reports you provided to me are 
from July – none of them addressed where you were after you were 
supposed to arrive in country and report to [the theatre lead] on August 2. 
According to management you never checked in with [the theatre lead] in 
Afghanistan and it was only by checking your credit card was it discovered 
that you had left country without out-processing (sic) and without proper 
authorization. That is why they claim you abandoned your post. 
 
Applicant disputed the account, and reiterated that he was in Afghanistan working since 
May 2011; that the statement regarding his travel itinerary, and especially his presence 
in California, were false; and that the theatre lead was the cause of the problems.107 
 
 Applicant was informed that if he paid his overdue corporate travel card 
expenses as instructed, the security flags would no longer be a concern.108 Although 
Applicant continued to dispute the amount, he realized that the stand-off was causing 
him to be unable to work. Accordingly in early November 2012, he sent a check for a 
partial payment to the corporation.109 He did not submit documentation to confirm that 
payment. On November 11, 2012, Applicant and the corporate payroll operations 
supervisor agreed to a monthly repayment plan of $250.110 He has made the agreed 
monthly payments since November 19, 2012.111 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
 The SOR also alleged an additional incident that occurred in May 1995, the 
giving of a false name, address, or birthdate to a law enforcement officer – a 
misdemeanor. Applicant was convicted of the charge in July 1995, and fined $250.112 
Applicant explained that a former client for whom he had done construction work, but 
who was also a drug dealer, had issued a contract on Applicant’s life at the time. 
Following the arrest, Applicant was placed in protective custody for one year.113 The

dealer.114 Applicant considered the incident a “turning point in my life.”115

Work Performance and Character References 
 
 Applicant’s work performance and character have been described by his 
combined joint task force commander in Afghanistan in extremely positive terms. He 
has been described as vital to the unit’s success. Applicant has “worked tirelessly” to 
improve the ability of the COP to provide early detection of an attack, and he is a valued 
member in enhancing the unit’s maneuverability and operability in the area.116 A senior 
non-commissioned officer in the unit described Applicant’s attributes as loyalty, honesty, 
duty, dedication to detail, work ethic, highest degree of professionalism, and respect, 
and supported Applicant without reservation.117 A former coworker, who has worked 
with Applicant for over 20 years, also gives Applicant his highest recommendation. 
Applicant is described as a team player who is reliable and intelligent, and a person who 
could always be counted on to put in more than his share of the work.118 The individual 
who flew with Applicant to Afghanistan in May 2011 also had positive things to say 
about him. He noted that Applicant has always displayed a “high degree of integrity, 
responsibility, and ambition. He is also the most dependable team player that I have 
ever had the opportunity to work with. His good judgment and mature outlook ensure a 
logical and practical approach to any endeavor.”119 A retired four-star general, now the 
president of a company, has known Applicant for about five years. Applicant has worked 
for him on various projects. Applicant has a positive, can-do attitude and desire to excel, 
with outstanding team leadership and technical competency, and tireless dedication to 
project timelines, as well as an impeccable character.120 Applicant was awarded a 
certificate of appreciation from the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command 
Forward – Afghanistan in recognition of outstanding support to the mission that was 
critical to the successful accomplishment of the mission.121 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”122 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access

to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”123   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”124 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.125  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”126 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”127 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Although there was a tax lien filed against Applicant in 2002, that lien 
was related to cash he had on hand derived from savings and the sale of a motor 
vehicle. Commencing in 2006, Applicant started experiencing some financial difficulties, 
and over the next few years those difficulties increased to the point where he was 
unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or sold. 
Repossessions occurred. With respect to those accounts and the purported outstanding 
balance on the corporate travel card of $5,466.09, AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or

occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.128 In addition, it is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) when the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2006 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Commencing in 2006, and continuing over the next few years, the national economic 
recession occurred – a situation that was largely beyond his control – and it caused him 
financial problems that made it difficult for him to remain current on all of his accounts. 
When the economy started to decline, many of the vendors he depended on for work 
slowed or stopped his company’s installation services. Unable to secure other contracts 
or gainful employment, he was eventually unable to meet his monthly business 
expenses, operating costs, and household payments. Vehicles were repossessed and 
auctioned off, but because of the equity he had built up in some of the vehicles, there 
were no deficiency or small balances.  
Applicant contacted his creditors and collection agents, tried to seek validation of 
accounts, and tried to work out repayment arrangements for those accounts he 
recognized.129 He also successfully disputed a number of accounts for various reasons, 
                                                          
128
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outs ide 
his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-

including those with creditors that he did not recognize, and unauthorized charges or 
debits. A number of such disputed accounts were subsequently either corrected or 
removed from his credit reports. It is of some interest that the older credit report reflects 
a number of delinquent accounts that found themselves included in the SOR, but those 
same accounts, no longer included in more recent credit reports, remain in the SOR. As 
noted above, Applicant completed financial management training. Applicant’s 
indebtedness was not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not 
spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were caused by 
circumstances largely beyond his control. Applicant was able to resolve all but one of 
his accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they have either been settled, paid off, 
or were removed from his credit report. There are two remaining accounts. One account 
related to the repossessed motor vehicle is in the process of being resolved under an 
agreed a repayment plan. The other account, pertaining to his corporate travel card, is 
also in the process of being paid after a lengthy period of controversy and dispute. 
Under the circumstances, Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent 
accounts, and his actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.130 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(c), it is potentially disqualifying if there is: 
 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

20 
                                      
 
It is also potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(d), if there is: 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government 
or other employer’s time or resources. 
 
In May 1995, Applicant gave a law enforcement officer a false name, address, or 
birthdate. He was convicted of the misdemeanor charge in July 1995 and fined $250. 
Thereafter, with the exception of the alleged conduct relating to his employer in 
Afghanistan and the use of the corporate travel card, there are no SOR allegations of 
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. As to this 1995 incident, AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(d) apply. 
 
 Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2011. There was substantial 
continuing controversy regarding Applicant’s difficulties in obtaining a new CAC, timely 
reimbursement of past authorized expenses, and access to a printer/scanner to upload 
necessary receipts and other required paperwork. As a result, he was unable to upload 
the receipts required for him to obtain reimbursement for transportation and lodging. 
Applicant requested permission to return to the large Air Force base where he could 
resolve the various corporate travel card account issues and get his CAC renewed, but 
his theatre lead directed him not to leave his COP “for any reason.” The corporate travel 
accounting office acknowledged Applicant’s inability to upload, mail, or fax necessary 
paperwork, and reported the situation to Applicant’s corporate director of OCONUS 
Operations. Applicant was promised a scanner, but it was never sent. Applicant 
obtained permission from his military commander to travel down to the large Air Force 
base to resolve the various corporate travel card account issues and get his CAC 
renewed, but Applicant’s theatre lead again denied him permission to do so.  
 
Upon receiving the newest denial, Applicant notified his theatre lead in person 
that he was resigning, and that upon getting access to the internet and a computer, he 
would e-mail his intentions to the corporate deputy program manager of business 
operations and the corporate director of OCONUS Operations. Applicant also called the 
corporate deputy program manager of business operations and told him the two 
reasons for resigning were the unresolved payroll and transportation issues and the 
“ineffective leadership,” and sought guidance on out-processing. He was referred to 
someone else. On August 2, 2011, the theatre lead informed the corporate director of 
OCONUS Operations that he had “no idea where (Applicant) is located,” and opined 
that Applicant had “been lying to [him] for quite some time about numerous things in 
addition to the other items we have discussed.” As noted above, the theatre lead offered 
no examples regarding the assertion that Applicant had been lying to him for some time, 
and no statement or other evidence was offered in which the theatre lead disputed 
 
21 
                                      
 
Applicant’s assertions regarding their relationship or that Applicant had personally 
informed him that he was resigning. This information directly contradicts the report by 
the theatre lead that Applicant was “supposed (sic) to report to work in Afghanistan but 
failed to report to in theatre lead. . . He did however arrive in country according to 
[military air] records.” From that point on, there is a proliferation of misinformation by 
and among the various corporate offices related to Applicant. It is clear that, contrary to 
the SOR allegation, Applicant did, in fact, report for duty in Afghanistan in May 2011, as 
opposed to August 2011. The remaining portion of the SOR allegation is that Applicant’s 
employment was terminated for his alleged failure to report for work.  
 
When he finally gained access to a computer, Applicant sent his corporate 
director of OCONUS Operations a message confirming his resignation, and indicating 
that he would out-process and return all corporate materials to the corporate office. That 
action merely confirmed Applicant’s earlier oral resignation. Nevertheless, the corporate 
director of OCONUS Operations, relying on the input from the theatre lead, erroneously 
reported Applicant “never did report to the theatre lead . . . as instructed and left country 
without processing or without authorization.” On August 12, 2011, Applicant wrote the 
corporate offices and requested out-processing guidance, but it was not furnished. The 
evidence does not support the allegations that Applicant failed to report for work in 
August 2011, or that he was terminated for his failure to report for work. As to those 
allegations, AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(d) have not been established. 
 
The remaining SOR allegation is that Applicant made unauthorized purchases, 
totaling $5,466, on his corporate travel card. As noted above, the security supervisor 
reported that Applicant had made purchases that were not approved and that he had 
terminated his employment without paying the money back or setting up a payment 
plan. It also reported that the corporate legal department had sent Applicant a 
collections letter but that Applicant had still not made a payment or acknowledgment of 
the issue. There is no evidence that pre-approval of purchases was ever required. Other 
than the opinion of the security supervisor, there is little evidence to support the 
conclusion that the purchases were “not approved” or “unauthorized.” The JPAS entry 
that the charges were not approved is insufficient to prove the charges were 
unauthorized. Furthermore, the characterization as applied to erroneous interpretations 
such as a charge in California clearly indicate Applicant had substantial reason to 
dispute the position of the corporation. The characterization of “unauthorized” or “not 
approved” without a scintilla of evidence to support that characterization, other than the 
JPAS entry, is insufficient to show questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Nevertheless, since that dispute has 
continued to the present, as to the corporate travel card, AG ¶ 16(d) only minimally 
applies, but AG ¶ 16(c) has not been established. 
 
 The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(c) may apply if the offense is so 
minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened 
under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Also, AG ¶ 17(f) may apply 
if the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. 
 
22 
                                      
 
 
 With respect to the 1995 incident, based on the evidence, the conduct was 
relatively minor, 17 years have passed since it occurred, the action was isolated, and it 
happened under such unique circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, as 
to this incident, AG ¶ 17(c) applies.  
 
 As to the entire environment and circumstances involving the issues that 
included Applicant’s use of his corporate travel card and his resignation, I conclude the 
information was unsubstantiated or from sources of questionable reliability. Regarding 
the circumstances surrounding both issues, there is conflicting evidence. For the 
government, there is documentation containing conclusions which are based largely on 
interpretations of Applicant’s actions and sometimes based on the input by the theatre 
lead. Those interpretations were sometimes supported by documentation, and 
sometimes not. While an employer’s decisions and characterizations of events are 
generally entitled to some deference, I am not bound by those characterizations if they 
are contradicted by other internally inconsistent or implausible evidence and are 
erroneous.131 This is not to say that I have uncritically accepted Applicant’s version of 
what had taken place. However, under the circumstances presented by the evidence, 
Applicant’s version seems more reasonable than the mere allegation of misconduct. 
 
 There is substantial evidence, including documentation and testimony from 
Applicant supporting Applicant’s explanations regarding his frustrations over the theatre 
lead’s actions and corporate intransigence in failing to facilitate Applicant’s efforts to 
resolve the various issues confronting him, especially while he was assigned to the 
COP. That frustration was exacerbated by the theatre lead when he refused to allow 
Applicant to come to a facility where there were scanners or other means of 
communication available. Furthermore, the theatre lead’s veracity is questioned when 
he informed the corporate director of OCONUS Operations that he had no idea where 
Applicant was located, and that Applicant had been lying to him for quite some time 
about numerous things in addition to the other items were discussed. This characteristic 
stands in stark contrast to Applicant’s continuing efforts, commencing in June 2011, and 
continuing even until today, to resolve the issues confronting him. Applicant used his 
corporate travel card when traveling, and he resigned when he could not obtain 
corporate support in resolving the issues. He was not terminated for failure to report to 
work. The disparaging remarks and negative characterizations by the theatre lead, as 
repeated by other corporate personnel, stand in stark contrast to the positive 
characterizations made by Applicant’s character witnesses – individuals who have 
known and worked with him over a number of years. There is no “questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that Applicant may not properly 
safeguard protected information.” To the contrary, there is abundant evidence from the 
joint task force commander in Afghanistan and other character witnesses that Applicant 
possesses characteristics directly opposite to those characterizations. Based on all of 
the above, AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(f) apply.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.132       
According to Applicant’s combined joint task force commander and a senior non-
commissioned officer in the unit in Afghanistan, Applicant was vital to the unit’s success. 
Applicant “worked tirelessly” to improve the ability of the COP to provide early detection 
of an attack, and he was a valued member in enhancing the unit’s maneuverability and 
operability in the area. Applicant’s attributes are loyalty, honesty, duty, dedication to 
detail, work ethic, highest degree of professionalism, and respect. Applicant was 
described by coworkers as a team player who is dependable, reliable, and intelligent, 
and a person who could always be counted on to put in more than his share of the work. 
A retired four-star general described Applicant as having a positive, can-do, attitude and 
desire to excel, with outstanding team leadership and technical competency, and tireless 
dedication to project timelines, as well as an impeccable character. 
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or sold. He furnished false information to law 
enforcement authorities in 1995. He engaged in continuing controversy with his 
employer, and finally resigned before resolving his corporate travel card balance.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has been described by those who have worked with him as honest, 
dependable, and reliable. He contacted his creditors and collection agents, tried to seek 
validation of accounts, and tried to work out repayment arrangements for those 
                                                          
132
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
24 
                                      
 
accounts he recognized. He also successfully disputed a number of accounts for 
various reasons. A number of such disputed accounts were subsequently either 
corrected or removed from his credit reports. Applicant completed financial 
management training. Applicant’s indebtedness was not caused by frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial 
problems were caused by circumstances largely beyond his control. Applicant was able 
to resolve all but two of his accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they have either 
been settled, paid off, or were removed from his credit report. The two remaining 
accounts, including the one pertaining to his corporate travel card, is in the process of 
being paid despite continuing controversy and dispute. The other remaining account is 
being paid under a repayment agreement. Under the circumstances, Applicant acted 
responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts, and his actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:133 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts, 
but his efforts regarding his corporate travel card were essentially delayed by 
mischaracterizations and distortions made by corporate personnel. The allegations 
regarding failure to report for work, making unauthorized purchases on his corporate 
travel card, and being terminated, are all without foundation or credible support. Overall, 
the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has

mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶
