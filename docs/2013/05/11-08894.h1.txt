GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 14, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On July 6, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on July 20, 
2012.2 On December 12, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG)

applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, 
effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 14, 2013. In a sworn undated 
statement,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on March 14, 2013, and he 
was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on March 22, 2013, but, as of May 7, 2013, he had not submitted a 
response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 8, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.g.) pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR. 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since February 
2011, has been serving as an audio/visual technician.4 He previously worked for other 
employers as an electronics technician.5 Applicant was born in Uganda in 1964, and he 
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985.6 Nothing is known about his primary or 
secondary education. He attended a correspondence school and was awarded a 
diploma in TV and VCR Repair in May 1987.7 He has never served in the U.S. military,8 
and has never been granted a security clearance.9 He was married in 1986, and he and 
his wife have four children, born in 1988, 1990, 1995, and 1998.10

Financial Considerations 
 
Although there was a judgment against Applicant filed in 2006, about which there 
is further discussion below, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 
mid-2010 when his employer started to lose business and altered Applicant’s pay 
structure. In August 2010, Applicant was earning between $1,000 and $1,200 per week, 
but with his altered pay structure, during Applicant’s final week with his employer in 
February 2011, his income dropped to a little over $100.11 Applicant attempted to 
reduce his expenses by cutting back on his telephone, satellite television, utilities, and 
other services.12 Because of the substantial decrease in income, he was unable to 
continue making his monthly payments, and accounts became delinquent, were placed 
for collection, charged off, or went to judgment.  
 
The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing delinquencies, but several of 
the accounts alleged are duplicates of other accounts. There is an automobile loan with 
a credit union with an unpaid balance of $18,098, of which $2,238 was past due, placed 
for collection, and charged off. The account went to judgment against Applicant and his 
nephew (who is also referred to as Applicant’s cousin) in the state district court in the 
amount of $19,062 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).13 Based on that judgment, the creditor filed a lien 
against Applicant and his nephew in the state circuit court in the amount of $19,116 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.).14 Applicant had previously co-signed on the note financing an automobile 
for his nephew, with the understanding that the nephew would pay all the payments 
after the first month. Applicant was unaware that his nephew had failed to make a single 
payment on the vehicle before he wrecked it. The vehicle was repossessed by the 
creditor at the junk yard where it was taken after the accident.15 The creditor obtained a 
garnishment against Applicant’s nephew, and $30.38 is taken from his salary each 
week.16 As of December 3, 2012, the balance had been reduced to $14,431.23.17 The 
account is in the process of being resolved.

 Item 6 (Personal Subject Interview, dated April 15, 2010), at 11. On February 10, 2011, Applicant received 
a letter from his employer stating: “Due to a lack of service work due to low sales volume of consumer electronics, the 
economy, and the fact that televisions are not needing major service, your job position will be eliminated until further 
notice.” See Item 6 (Letter, dated February 10, 2011).

 Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated March 23, 2011), at 5, 12; Item 
7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 8, 2012), at 1; Item 9 (State Judiciary Judgments and Lien Search, dated March 
7, 2013). The entry in Item 8, at 5, contains an erroneous statement that the plaintiff in the judgment was “medical.”  
The information appearing in Item 9 disputes that allegation. 
 
14
 Item 9, supra note 13. Applicant contended the two allegations in the SOR (¶ 1.a. and ¶ 1.b.) refer to the 
same account, and the information appearing in Item 9 supports his contention.

There is a telephone account with a high credit, unpaid balance, and past due 
balance of $164 that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.f.).18 The account was 
eventually transferred or sold to another collection agent, and that collection agent and 
Applicant agreed to a settlement based on a payment of $81 (SOR ¶ 1.c.).19 That 
payment was made, and the account was closed with a zero balance.20 The account 
has been resolved. 
 
There is an account for a home security system with a high credit of $1,871, and 
an unpaid past due balance of $1,590 that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d.).21 The 
account was subsequently transferred or sold to another collection agent, but it no 
longer appears on Applicant’s 2012 Equifax credit report. He contends he contacted the 
new collection agent in an effort to set up a repayment plan, but he has not submitted 
any documentation to support his contention. The account has not yet been resolved. 
 
There is an airline-affiliated bank credit card account with an unpaid balance of 
$16,698, of which $3,799 was past due (SOR ¶ 1.e.).22 Applicant contacted the creditor 
and they agreed to permit him to enroll in their Hardship Program, provided he made a 
monthly payment of $186.23 He contends he started making monthly payments of $250 
in February 2011.24 His minimum monthly payments were increased to $480,25 and as 
of January 3, 2013, he had a past due amount of $384, and was credited with a 
payment of $96 and unspecified credits of $300, for the previous month.26 Applicant’s 
remaining balance as of January 3, 2013, was $14,660.51.27 The account is in the 
process of being resolved. 
 
There is a charge account with a large home improvement retailer with a high 
credit of $4,384, an unpaid balance of $3,398, and a past due balance of $699 (SOR ¶ 
1.g.).28 Applicant initially contended that the account was satisfied in January 2011, but 
subsequently revised his position and acknowledged that he entered a repayment plan 
at that time, and he has been making pre-authorized monthly $60 payments under the

plan.29 In July 2012, Applicant claimed the remaining balance had been reduced to 
$2,498,30 and when he submitted his Answer to the SOR, he contended it had been 
reduced further to $2,078.31 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
In July 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
family net monthly income of $5,317. He claimed $5,278 in monthly expenses, including 
debt payments, leaving $39 for discretionary spending or savings. He also indicated 
$100 in bank savings, $2,000 in cash on hand, and $5,000 in stocks and bonds.32 
Applicant has never received financial counseling.33 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”34 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”35   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”38 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”39 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. There is an isolated delinquent account that was charged off and 
went to judgment in 2006. In mid-2010, Applicant was unable to continue paying his 
normal monthly bills, and accounts became delinquent, placed for collection, or charged 
off. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.40 In addition, it is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) when the individual has 
                                                          
40
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
 
8 
                                      
 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s purported financial difficulties 
since 2006, with special emphasis since mid-2010, and continuing for several years 
thereafter, make it difficult to conclude that they occurred “so long ago” or were “so 
infrequent.” His initial financial problem, related to the co-signed motor vehicle loan and 
the subsequent judgment and lien, were essentially the result of the actions of his 
nephew in failing to make agreed payments and then wrecking the vehicle. The 
nephew’s actions exposed Applicant to financial liability. The subsequent financial 
problems were attributed to the abrupt loss of his business income due to the poor 
economy and a lack of service work. Both circumstances were clearly largely beyond 
his control.  
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the credit reports referred to several accounts that were either incorrectly reported or no 
longer accurate after the status of the account had changed. The Appeal Board has 
previously held that “adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard.” However, when the information in the credit report is 
refuted by documentation from the actual creditor, and the credit reporting company is 
furnished the correct information but still refuses or fails to correct its entries in a timely 
manner, one can conclude that the information in the credit report – actually a summary 
or secondary evidence pertaining to an account – is less accurate, trustworthy, or 
reliable than the other evidence of record.41 
Applicant reduced his expenses in an attempt to remain current on a number of 
his accounts. In an effort to address and resolve his accounts, he contacted his 
creditors and collection agents regarding the alleged delinquent accounts. He managed 
to pay off one account, and he is in the process of resolving two other accounts under 
agreed repayment plans. His nephew is in the process of resolving the lien under a 
garnishment of his wages. The sole remaining account is no longer on Applicant’s 2012

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
41
 In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the substantial 
evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent 
allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

credit report, and he contends he has attempted to set up a repayment plan, but has not 
yet received any documentation from the creditor or collection agent. Applicant 
successfully disputed two accounts, furnishing sufficient documentation to conclude that 
those two accounts are actually duplicates of other accounts alleged in the SOR. While 
Applicant never received financial counseling, there are clear indications that his 
financial problems are being resolved and are under control.42 Applicant’s actions under 
the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.43 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.44       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He allowed 
several accounts to become delinquent, placed for collection, charged off, or to become 
a judgment and a lien. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. As 
a good and perhaps overly trusting uncle, Applicant co-signed on a motor vehicle loan

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-

attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

for his nephew and received the brunt of the financial liability created when that nephew 
failed to make any agreed payments and wrecked the vehicle. Applicant’s indebtedness 
was not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond 
his means. Instead, his financial problems were caused several years later when 
Applicant was laid off with no notice because of a poor economy and a lack of work. He 
struggled to continue making his payments, but eventually was unable to continue doing 
so. He contacted his creditors, developed a repayment plan, gathered his available 
assets, and started paying his creditors. With one exception, Applicant’s delinquent 
accounts have either been settled, paid off, or are in the process of being paid. The one 
exception is the account that is next in line to be resolved. Applicant’s financial 
problems are in the process of being resolved and his finances are under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:45 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his [or her] 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(“Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶¶ 2(a)(1) through AG  2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
       
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
