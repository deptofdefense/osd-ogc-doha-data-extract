RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the Government’s security concerns under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 21, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on April 16, 2013, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2013. The Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 9, 2013. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled on August 29, 2013. The Government offered 
 
2 
 
 
exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and they were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified, and she offered exhibits (AE) A through K, and they were admitted 
into evidence without objection. The record was held open until September 11, 2013, to 
provide Applicant the opportunity to present additional exhibits, which she did. They 
were marked AE L and M and admitted into evidence without objection.1 DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2013.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows:  
  
 1.x-the amount alleged is $4,100, it is changed to $6,800. 
 1.y-the amount alleged is $754, it is changed to $729. 
 1.z-the amount alleged is $522, it is changed to $156.2 
 
There was objection and the motion was granted.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant denied all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review 
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 52 years old. She is not married and has no children. She earned a 
bachelor’s degree in 1993. She has worked for her employer, a federal contractor, for 
22 years and has held a security clearance since at least 1997. She has lived at her 
current residence since 1998.3  
 
 The SOR alleges Applicant has 27 debts totaling approximately $38,000. 
Applicant attributes her financial problems to medical conditions. They caused her to 
have several extended hospital stays; numerous surgeries; expenses for co-payments; 
and out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions, medical supplies, in-home care, and 
oxygen. She continues to suffer from severe asthma and other medical maladies. In the 
past three years, she has had 12 medical procedures or surgeries. She accumulated 
many medical bills beginning in 2002, but her medical problems became extreme in 
2010. Applicant has medical insurance with a $2,150 deductible. She has a $5,000 
deductible for non-network provider services. She has a healthcare spending account 
that helps defray some of her out-of-pocket expenses. She continues to receive her full 
pay when she is out on disability and unable to work. Applicant provided a list of

medical bills she has been paying that are not reflected on the SOR. She also attributed 
her financial problems to costly repairs she had to make on her home.4  
 
 The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is a medical debt ($821). Applicant disputes the 
debt. In December 2011 she paid $350 to the original creditor, a hospital. She wrote the 
creditor a letter, and they provided an itemized bill that does not reflect her payment. 
Through her post-hearing submissions, she indicated the creditor advised her that the 
account is being managed by another creditor. The new creditor advised Applicant the 
account shows a zero balance. Applicant provided a bank statement with her notations 
showing $5.53 was paid to the original creditor listed on SOR ¶ 1.a. It is unclear if this 
satisfies the remaining amount owed. Applicant is actively attempting to resolve this 
debt.5 
 
 At her hearing, Applicant testified that she had a payment settlement plan with 
the creditor to pay $50 a month for the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c through 1.p.6 
In Applicant’s post-hearing submissions, she indicated that the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.c through 1.l and 1.n through 1.p are being settled through the plan. Applicant made 
an initial payment of $74.55 and then will make 18 monthly payments of $50 to satisfy 
the debts. She provided proof she made the initial payment.7 The medical debt in SOR 
¶ 1.m ($103) was paid in August 2013.8 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($255) is a credit card account. Applicant testified the 
account had been turned over to a collection company. Through her post-hearing 
submission, she indicated the collection firm also owns the debt in SOR ¶ 1.y ($729). 
She made $75 payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b throughout 2012. She provided a 
letter indicating the debt was settled in full. In May 2013, she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.y 
with two payments of $379. Both debts are resolved.9 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($8,323) is a charged-off credit card debt. The collection 
firm that is handling the account had another delinquent credit card debt that it was 
attempting to collect from Applicant. Applicant indicated that the firm agreed to settle the 
other credit card debt for $3,000 and advised her that she would receive an IRS form 
1099C for the amount of the debt that was canceled. Applicant paid the $3,000 
settlement in December 2012. Applicant indicated in her post-hearing submission that 
the collection firm indicated that because she paid the $3,000 and was also paying two 
other delinquent debts (one of which was SOR ¶ 1.q) through their firm that they would

dismiss the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q without prejudice. She will receive an IRS form 1099C for 
this debt. She provided the supporting documents.10 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.r ($10,018) is a charged-off credit card debt. Applicant has 
a settlement payment plan with the creditor. She began the plan in February 2013. The 
settlement payment plan calls for her to pay $450 a month for ten months. She has 
made all of her monthly payments to date and will complete the plan in November 2013. 
She has been advised that an IRS form 1099C will be issued for the amount of the debt 
that is canceled.11  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.s ($2,106) is a charged-off credit card debt. Applicant paid 
$1,790 on August 5, 2013. She indicated the creditor accepted this amount as paid in 
full for the debt. She provided supporting documentation of her payment.12 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.t ($2,628) is a charged-off credit card. Applicant paid $2,981 
on August 2, 2013. The debt is paid in full. She provided supporting documentation.13 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.u ($4,843) is a charged-off credit card debt. Applicant 
provided a letter stating the debt was settled on May 31, 2013. It does not reflect how 
much was paid.14 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.v ($244) is for a charged-off store account. Applicant paid 
the full amount owed on the account on August 22, 2013.15 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.w ($1,214) is for an account placed for collection. She made 
two payments of $380, and the account was settled in August 2013.16 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.x ($6,800) is a store account placed for collection. Applicant 
made monthly payments of $150 beginning in early 2013. She then made two payments 
of $1,000 to settle the debt. The debt was settled in March 2013. She will receive an 
IRS form 1099C for the amount of the debt canceled.17

 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.z ($156) is for a charged-off account. Applicant disputed 
that the debt indicating she paid the debt in full in November 2011. She requested the 
credit bureaus remove the debt from her credit report. She requested a letter to confirm 
that the debt was paid in full, but has not yet received it. She provided a confirmation 
number.18 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.aa ($810) is for an account placed in collection. Applicant 
made four payments of $202 from May through August 2011. She provided proof of the 
payments.19 
 
 Applicant took out a $9,400 loan from her 401k pension account in July 2013 to 
help pay her debts. Over the years she spent a lot of money to do necessary repairs on 
her house. She is making $100 installment payments to the IRS for her 2012 federal 
income taxes. She owed $2,800 for the 2012 tax year. She maintains a written budget 
to track her expenses. She recently purchased a new vehicle for $37,000. Her monthly 
payments are $479. Her current annual salary is approximately $94,000.20 
 
 Applicant had her mortgage modified in March 2012 due to her medical 
conditions, which lowered her payments and allowed her to pay some of her delinquent 
debts.21 In 2011 and 2012, Applicant worked with a debt payment company, but found 
that it charged exorbitant fees and then did not follow through on what it promised. She 
canceled her account with the company in January 2013.22  
 
 Applicant has received numerous awards throughout her career.23 She received 
positive performance evaluations.24 She provided character letters that reflect she is a 
person of good moral character. She conducts herself with integrity. She is hardworking, 
dedicated, respected, trustworthy, reliable, motivated, a self-starter, and 
conscientious.25 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief

introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  
 
7 
 
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following two are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant had 27 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $38,000, that she was 
unable or unwilling to pay. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
8 
 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established because Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, 
and some are still being resolved. Applicant attributed her history of financial problems 
to her numerous medical issues, surgeries, and out-of-pocket expenses. She also 
attributed her financial problems to costly repairs she had to make on her home. These 
things were beyond her control. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must 
have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant was receiving her full pay 
while she was out of work, so her income was not impacted. She has a high deductible 
for her medical insurance, but she also earns a substantial salary and is single. 
Applicant had more than ten credit cards that were past due, delinquent, or charged off. 
Although her medical problems had an impact on her ability to manage her finances and 
caused her to have out-of-pocket medical expenses, she was also using her credit 
cards beyond her ability to make timely payments. She made an effort to pay some of 
her bills before she received the SOR, but she did not act completely responsibly with 
her finances. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
 
 Applicant has paid, settled or resolved many of her delinquent debts. She has 
payment plans in place for all but one of the remaining debts. There are clear 
indications her financial problems are being resolved and under control. AG ¶¶ 20(c) 
and 20(d) apply. Applicant is actively disputing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. She has 
contacted the original creditor and the collection company. AG ¶ 20(e) applies.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 
9 
 
 
Applicant is 52 years old. She has had numerous medical problems and 
surgeries over the past several years. Some of her medical expenses were not covered 
by insurance, and she had out-of-pocket expenses. She had to make substantial repairs 
to her home. Her serious medical conditions affected her ability to manage her finances 
for a period of time. Applicant incurred numerous credit card debts that were charged 
off. She has now paid most of her delinquent debts. She has a payment plan for her 
medical expenses. She has settled or paid in full her other debts. She has a legitimate 
dispute with one medical creditor. Applicant has gained an understanding about the 
importance of maintaining her finances. She is acting responsibly toward resolving her 
remaining debts. Her finances are not a security concern. Overall, the record evidence 
leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security 
concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.aa:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
