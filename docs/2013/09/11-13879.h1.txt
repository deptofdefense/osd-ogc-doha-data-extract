HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts were caused by the decline in real estate values and 
his tenants’ failure to pay their rent. His statement of reasons (SOR) lists a discharge 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code of Applicant’s debts in November 1992, and in 
October 2012, he filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In May 2013, 
the Bankruptcy Court confirmed his Chapter 13 repayment plan. He made sufficient 
progress resolving his financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 22, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86) 
(Item 4). On June 5, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On July 4, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived his 
right to a hearing. (Item 3) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated July 29, 2013, was provided to him on August 8, 2013. He was afforded an 
opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.1 On August 31, 2013, Applicant responded to the FORM. The case was 
assigned to me on September 12, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.b, and he explained why he had financial problems. (Item 3) His admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old equipment test technician, who has worked for the 
same defense contractor since 1987.3 He served as an enlisted sailor in the Navy active 
reserve from 1985 to 2002, and he received an honorable discharge. He married in 
1980, and he divorced in 1989. His son was born in 1985. He was convicted of driving 
under the influence of alcohol in December 2006.4 There is no other evidence of alcohol 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated July 30, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 8, 
2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s June 22, 2007 SF 86 is the basis for the facts in this 
paragraph. (Item 4) 
 
4Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he drove under the influence of alcohol in December 2006. 
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). His December 2006 DUI is not recent, and it will not be considered for any purpose 
because Applicant has not had adequate notice and a full opportunity to collect and present evidence of 
mitigation regarding this allegation.

abuse or use of illegal drugs. He did not disclose any financial delinquencies on his 
June 22, 2007 SF 86. 
 
Financial considerations 
 
In 1992, Applicant’s unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter 
7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Applicant explained that this bankruptcy was caused by a 
year-long layoff while he was in the midst of building a home. (Item 3) 
 
Applicant’s September 26, 2011 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
personal subject interview (PSI) provided a detailed description of his finances. (Item 8 
at 8-10) In October 2010, a credit card creditor obtained a judgment for $20,122 against 
Applicant. (Item 8 at 9) In June 2011, a credit card creditor obtained a judgment for 
$8,000 against Applicant. (Item 8 at 9) In August 2011, a credit card creditor began 
collecting a $1,200 monthly garnishment to address a debt. (Item 8 at 9) He also had 
the following collection debts: a $2,800 credit card debt; a $5,741 credit card debt; a 
$527 credit card debt; and a $15,773 personal loan. (Item 8 at 9)  
 
On October 30, 2011, he satisfied a judgment of unspecified amount. (Item 8) In 
June 2012, he received a garnishment summons for a $23,082 debt. (Item 9)      
 
Applicant explained the origin of his financial problems. He purchased two rental 
properties, and as long as they were rented, he was able to pay his debts. (Item 8 at 10) 
Over the 2009-2011 period, his renters periodically refused to pay rent, and he was 
eventually able to evict the tenants. (Item 3) He was also plagued with unexpected 
repair bills on his rental properties. (Item 3) 
 
On October 30, 2012, Applicant filed his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Plan, which 
indicate: (1) he had assets of $280,200 in real property and $20,400 in personal 
property; (2) he had liabilities of $388,266 in secured claims, $4,060 in unsecured 
priority claims, and $20,234 in unsecured nonpriority claims; (3) his monthly income was 
$5,109; and (4) his monthly expenditures were $6,556. (Item 6 Summary of Bankruptcy 
Schedules; Item 7) In October 2012, he paid a $505 retainer for filing of his Chapter 13 
Bankruptcy petition, and $375 for fees and costs. (Item 6) Attorney fees of $2,245 were 
to be paid by the bankruptcy trustee. (Item 6) In sum, he had total assets of $300,600 
and total liabilities of $412,650. (Item 6 Summary of Bankruptcy Schedules) The 
unsecured priority debt relates to federal income taxes from 2011. Applicant received 
financial counseling, and he generated a budget as part of the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy 
process. On May 23, 2013, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed Applicant’s Chapter 13 
Payment Plan. (Item 7) 
 
Applicant’s federal income tax returns show the following income from wages 
and salaries: 2009 ($67,528); 2010 ($55,205); 2011 ($72,311); and 2012 ($44,048). 
(Item 8) His federal income taxes were paid in full each year except for 2011, and he 
currently owes the federal government $4,060 for 2011, as indicated on his Chapter 13 
Bankruptcy Plan.

In Applicant’s FORM response, he said he had a 15-year track record of paying 
his debts after his 1992 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. He repeated his previous statements 
about his tenants’ failure to pay rent on his rental properties being the cause of his 
financial predicament, and he added that he labored to make repairs on his rental 
properties. He was unable to make required credit card payments because credit card 
fees, required payments, and interest charges accelerated. He unsuccessfully 
attempted to refinance his home and consolidate his debts. He said, “In late 2011, . . . I 
chose to file CH13 to arrive at a plan to get relief and pay what [I] can on my de[b]t. I 
have a plan in place[.] I have paid [$]450.00 per month since November 2011.” It is 
unclear where the $450 monthly payments were paid. He noted his federal tax debt is 
included in his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Plan and will be paid, as it is a priority debt. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his OPM PSI, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Plan, SOR response, and 
FORM response. The record establishes Applicant has a history of delinquent debts, 
debts in collection, financial judgments, delinquent federal income taxes, and 
garnishments. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The FORM makes three arguments against mitigating financial considerations 
concerns. First, Applicant’s purchase of two rental properties was irresponsible because 
it overextended him financially, and it was foreseeable that tenants would not pay their 
rent. He had insufficient financial reserves for such contingencies. Second, his Chapter 
13 Bankruptcy materials do not show a track record of payments, as it was only 
confirmed in May 2013. Third, Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of his 
attempts to divest himself of the rental properties and of his attempts to earn more 
income. These arguments have some merit; however, they are insufficient to disqualify 
Applicant from access to classified information. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Investment in two rental properties does not show lack of financial 
responsibility. The profound decline in real estate values from 2007-2011 was 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
unprecedented in the last 50 years. This decline caused the rental market to become 
unstable, and made it impossible for Applicant to sell his properties for the amount of his 
mortgages. Sophisticated mortgage lenders and real estate investors made the same 
assumptions Applicant made about the expectation of continued increase in real estate 
values. Applicant had every reason to believe he would have a steady stream of rental 
income, and the purchase of the two properties would not result in delinquent debt. 
Over the last 50 years, with the exception of 2007-2011, investment in real estate is one 
of the most conservative, prudent avenues to financial success. When he sustained 
losses on his two rental properties, he was unable to pay his credit cards, and charges 
and interest rates rapidly increased. His financial problems were affected by 
circumstances largely beyond his control. He paid off one judgment in 2011, and he 
said he was paying $450 per month since November 2011 to address his delinquent 
debts.6 He had insufficient income to pay his debts and chose to file for protection under 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  
 
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the applicant had $41,000 in delinquent 
credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. 
Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge 
issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently 
divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her 
former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child support to her. The Appeal 
Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that 
applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was 
issued. The Appeal Board also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability 
of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence7 of irresponsible behavior, poor 
judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay her creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
                                            
6 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). 
 
7 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Partial application of AG ¶ 20(c) is warranted. Applicant received some financial 
counseling, and he generated a budget as part of the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy process. 
Although there is limited evidence of record that he established and maintained contact 
with his creditors,8 his financial problem is being resolved or is under control. He has a 
bankruptcy court-approved payment plan to resolve his remaining debts.    
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith.9 AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Applicant did not dispute any of his delinquent SOR 
debts.    
 
                                            
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts primarily because of the decline in the 
real estate market, failure of his tenants to pay rent, increased credit card fees and 
interests, and insufficient income. The Bankruptcy Court has assessed his ability to pay 
his creditors and determined his monthly payment. He began the bankruptcy process 
prior to his receipt of the SOR. He has established his financial responsibility. It is 
unlikely that financial problems will recur. His efforts are sufficient to fully mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns. Assuming, financial considerations concerns 
are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are mitigated under the whole-
person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old equipment test technician, who has worked for the 
same defense contractor since 1987.  He served as an enlisted sailor in the Navy active 
reserve from 1985 to 2002, and he received an honorable discharge. He is sufficiently 
mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves 
substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a 
contractor, and as a sailor in the Navy. There is every indication that he is loyal to the 
United States and his employer. The decline in real estate prices and the failure of his 
tenants to comply with their rental contracts and pay rent contributed to his financial 
woes. I give Applicant substantial credit for utilizing Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code 
and paying what he is able to his creditors.    
 
If Applicant fails to make his court-ordered bankruptcy payments, his bankruptcy 
will be dismissed, and all money paid under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy may be applied as 
partial payment towards interest and penalties. He would then likely discover that he 
owed more after making the payments than he owed before the bankruptcy was filed.

His attorney fees, trustee fees, filing fees, and some other charges will also be forfeited. 
I am confident Applicant will keep his promise to continue resolving his debts and 
comply with bankruptcy court’s payment plan. The Appeal Board has addressed a key 
element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust him. He paid $450 monthly 
since November 2011, and he has established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-
payment. I am confident he will keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts and 
comply with his Chapter 13 payment plan.10 He is an asset to his employer, or he would 
not have retained his employment since 1987.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
                                            
10 Of course, the government can revalidate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case 
No. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary 
security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her 
financial problems.” and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
