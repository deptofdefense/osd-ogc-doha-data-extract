RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, financial considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 21, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. The action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on January 27, 2013. On May 2, 2013, Applicant 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
June 14, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of 
hearing on July 10, 2013. I convened the hearing as scheduled August 14, 2013. The 
 
2 
 
 
Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, and they were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified, and he offered exhibits (AE) A and B, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open until August 28, 
2013, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which he did. They were 
marked as AE C through G and admitted into evidence without objection.1 DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 22, 2013.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the 
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 58 years old. He holds a bachelor’s degree in business. He was 
previously married from 1972 to 1976 and has one child from the marriage, who is 40 
years old. He remarried in 1979, and he and his wife have two children, ages 31 and 21. 
Their youngest child, a son, is in college.2  
 
 Applicant experienced two periods of unemployment. In May 2008, he was laid 
off from a job where he was earning approximately $115,000 annually. He began 
working again in April 2009 until March 2010, earning about $70,000, when he was 
again laid off. He was unemployed until February 2011, when he started working for his 
present employer. Applicant’s wife has been consistently employed as a school teacher 
during this time, earning approximately $77,000. During the periods of unemployment, 
Applicant was able to pay the first and second mortgages on his home, but used credit 
cards to help pay other expenses. He was receiving unemployment benefits when he 
was unemployed.3 Applicant currently earns about $107,000 in gross salary.4 
 
 Applicant explained that after he lost his job the interest rates on his credit cards 
increased drastically, and it was impossible to keep up with the payments. He and his 
wife stopped making minimum payments on all of their credit cards in April 2010. They 
contacted the credit card companies to explain their financial situation. They have been 
making $10 payments on all of their credit card debts to show the creditors that they 
intend to pay the debts.5

Once Applicant got a job, he and his wife decided the best way to retire their 
delinquent debt was to save their money, and when they accumulated a certain amount, 
they would contact the creditor that they owed with the smallest balance and negotiate a 
settlement agreement.6  
 
The SOR lists ten credit card debts totaling approximately $169,445. Applicant 
settled the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($19,811) for $9,200 in August 2012. He received an 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1099-C for $9,445 for the amount canceled on this 
debt.7  
 
 The credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($33,009) was used by Applicant in 2010 to 
purchase his son a car and for other expenses that he could not recall. The 2006 car 
cost approximately $6,000. The debt is charged off. Applicant pays the insurance on his 
son’s vehicle, which is approximately $1,000 annually. His son began college in 2010 
and uses student loans to pay for his education. Applicant provides him between $500 
and $1,000 a semester. Applicant stopped paying the minimum payment on this debt in 
April 2010, when he began paying $10 a month on it. The debt is not paid. Applicant 
indicated he intended to pay the debt in 2014.8  
 
 The credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($6,635) is not paid and is charged off. 
Applicant’s plan was to pay this debt in 2012, but had unexpected repairs to make on 
two of his vehicles and additional college expenses for his son. He used the money he 
would have used to pay this debt to pay the other expenses. He indicated he intended 
to pay the debt in 2013.9  
 
 The credit card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($25,676), 1.e ($23,987), 1.f ($6,300), and 
1.g ($8,927) are charged off. The credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($23,597) is in collection 
and not paid. Applicant stated he intended on paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h in 2013, but 
he has now moved that date to 2014. He intends to pay the debts in ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g in 
2013.10  
 
Applicant stated the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($9,434) was settled for $2,818 
in October 2011. He received an IRS 1099-C form noting that $6,577 of the debt and 
$866 of interest was canceled.11

 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($12,369) was in collection. Applicant settled the debt in 
December 2011 for approximately $6,160. He received an IRS 1099-C form noting 
$4,002 was canceled. Applicant indicated he has paid other debts that were not listed 
on the SOR.12  
 
 Applicant and his wife own three older model cars. They keep the third car in 
case the other two need repairs. They maintain the minimum insurance required on the 
third car. They also own a second home in another state. It was Applicant’s wife’s family 
home, and they bought out her siblings’ interests in the home in 2000. Applicant 
estimated they pay about $1,200 a year in property taxes and about $120 a month for 
utilities.13  
 
 Applicant borrowed about $3,000 against his life insurance policy in 2002 and 
$27,000 in 2008. He and his wife refinanced their home in approximately 2006 or 2007. 
He indicated he took equity out of the house, but he could not recall how much. He and 
his wife used about $36,000 of the money to pay his wife’s sisters for the family home. 
He could not recall what they used the rest of the money for. Applicant stated he 
contributes money to a 401k retirement account. He estimated he has about $350,000 
in 401k accounts. He has an Individual Retirement Account 72T program that provides 
him with $1,200 month as conditional income for five years. He began receiving the 
payments in July 2010. He indicated that when his wife retires in 2015, she will be 
entitled to a lump-sum payment of $250,000 that will help them pay their delinquent 
debts. He intends on retiring all of his delinquent debt in 2015.14 
 
 Applicant and his wife continue to hold three credit cards. He indicated they have 
balances under $500 on two cards and about $800-$900 on a third card. He indicated 
they are current with their payments on the cards. They have about $17,000 in savings 
they have accumulated that they intend on using to settle debts. They have not settled a 
debt since August 2012. He indicated he received financial counseling beginning in 
2010 and was counseled at different times, including in 2012. He was advised to save 
his money until he had enough to settle his debts, starting with the smallest.15  
 
 Applicant provided a 2008 credit bureau report that shows he had more than 
$100,000 in consumer debt before he lost his job. These credit card debts were not 
delinquent. He was making monthly payments on them. When he lost his job, and the 
interest rates increased, he had difficulty paying them. He admitted that he did not have 
any reserve money saved at that time.16

Applicant provided a character letter from the facilities security officer of his 
employer. His commitment to the adherence of corporate policies and security is 
described as commendable. He has shown great initiative and is a dedicated 
hardworking member of the corporate team. Applicant is an integral component of the 
employer’s security program and is constantly seeking to improve the safeguarding 
capabilities of their technology. He is vigilant in identifying and reporting unauthorized 
attempts to access data. He has no history of security violations.17 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
                                                          
17 AE A.

classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following two are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant has numerous delinquent debts totaling more than $100,000, from at 
least 2010 that he is unable or unwilling to pay. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise 
the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
7 
 
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established because Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, 
and unresolved. Applicant attributed his history of financial problems to two periods of 
unemployment. His unemployment was beyond his control. The interest rates on his 
credit cards increased due to his inability to maintain payments on the cards because of 
his unemployment. He used credit cards to subsidize his expenses during his periods of 
unemployment. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b) Applicant must have acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Prior to his unemployment periods, Applicant had 
a large amount of consumer debt that was not delinquent and he was making monthly 
payments on. He had minimal cash reserve. When he lost his job the consumer debts 
became unmanageable. In 2010, he purchased a car for his son. He was aware he was 
already experiencing financial problems during that time. He used a credit card to make 
the purchase. He stopped paying all of his credit cards, except for $10 a month, in April 
2010. His wife was employed during his periods of unemployment and he received 
small unemployment benefits. He also has been receiving $1,200 a month from his IRA. 
Applicant was able to pay his mortgage expenses and maintain the property taxes and 
maintenance expenses on a second home. He did not abandon his debts. He contacted 
his creditors advising them he intended to pay the debts. He settled and paid three 
debts. He is saving to resolve others, but he has not been compliant with his plan 
because of unexpected expenses. Applicant’s unemployment impacted his finances, but 
his large amount of consumer debt reflects spending beyond his means. I find there 
were conditions beyond Applicant’s control that attributed to his financial problems. 
However, Applicant was also making poor financial decisions that negatively impacted 
his ability to pay his bills. I find AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies.  
 
 Applicant’s financial position is improving, but it is not sufficiently stable and 
under control to conclude it is no longer an issue. He has a plan for resolving his debts, 
but has not followed it because other expenses were more pressing. He has not 
abandoned his debts, but paying $10 a month on some delinquent debts of over 
$25,000 is not considered a good-faith effort to repay the creditors or resolve the debt. 
Applicant’s wife was working during his unemployment. He borrowed on his life 
insurance and owes approximately $33,000 on it. He is receiving payments from his 
IRA. He also took equity from his home when he refinanced it. Yet he is still in financial 
difficulty. He stated he has received financial counseling. Applicant has made some 
efforts to resolve his debts. Although he stated he intends to resolve all of his debts by 
2015, he still has over $100,000 in consumer debt, and at this juncture, I am not 
confident that there are clear indications that his financial problems are under control. 
 
8 
 
 
Applicant needs more time to aggressively pursue decreasing his delinquent debts. I 
find AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) partially applies.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 58 years old. He has over $100,000 of consumer credit card debt 
that is unpaid and unresolved. When he became unemployed the interest rates on his 
credit cards escalated, and he was unable to pay them. He was carrying an 
extraordinary amount of consumer debt even before he experienced periods of 
unemployment. He has resolved some debts, and stated he intends to pay the 
remaining ones. It appears Applicant was living beyond his means and the escalated 
interest rates made it impossible to continue to pay his creditors. It is too early to 
conclude that Applicant’s finances are no longer an issue and that there are clear 
indications that his finances are under control. They remain a security concern, and he 
has not met his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph   1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.h:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.i-1.j:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
