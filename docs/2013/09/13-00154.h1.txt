Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. There is substantial evidence
establishing a history of financial problems or difficulties, but he presented sufficient
evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. In addition, he did not
deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant facts when he answered a question about
his financial record on a November 2012 security clearance application. Accordingly,
this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On or about April 12, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations
and Guideline E for personal conduct.   
Applicant answered the SOR on May 15, 2013. Neither Applicant nor Department
Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the written record.2
Thereafter, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material information
that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant material (FORM) was3
mailed to Applicant, who received it July 23, 2013. He replied within the 30-day period
allowed under the Directive, and his reply marked and admitted without objections as
follows: (1) Exhibit A–one page memorandum, dated August 24, 2013; (2) Exhibit
B–letter of recommendation, dated August 22, 2013; (3) Exhibit C–letter of
recommendation, dated April 6, 2013, with military certificate of appreciation; (4) Exhibit
D–Transunion credit report, dated October 28, 2012; and (5) Exhibit E–Experian credit
report, dated October 28, 2012. The case was assigned to me September 10, 2013.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR is mixed. He admitted the three delinquent debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.c; he denied the six delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d–1.i
and stated that those debts were resolved; and he denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a
that he falsified his response to Question 26 concerning his financial record. His
admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In addition,
the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance for his job as a foreign-language linguist and cultural advisor
working in support of the U.S. armed forces. His educational background includes an
associate’s degree awarded in 2009 and a bachelor’s degree awarded in 2011. His first
marriage ended in divorce, and he married his current spouse in 2001. He is the father
of three children, born in 1999, 2003, and 2010. His spouse is a school teacher. 
Applicant’s employment history includes working in sales and management for a
jewelry store from 1999 to early 2012, when he was laid off. He was then unemployed

from February 2012 until the end of November 2012, a period of about ten months.
During this time, his family relied on his spouse’s salary and unemployment
compensation, which amounted to about $1,944 monthly.  This allowed Applicant to4
provide for his family’s basic needs, but he fell behind on credit card accounts and
medical bills. His job as a linguist, which he began in about December 2012, has
allowed him to repay his delinquent debts. Since then, he has worked overseas in
support of a Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan. He has performed his
duties, which include going on combat operations, well as evidenced by two letters of
recommendation from U.S. special forces officers.    5
While going through the in-processing requirements with his company, Applicant
was tasked to complete a security clearance application. He signed the application on
November 12, 2012.  In completing the application, he disclosed four  delinquent6
accounts in response to a question asking about delinquency involving routine
accounts. He disclosed a $63 medical bill that went to collection in 2008, but was paid in
2009; he disclosed a $1,096 medical collection account (alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a); he
disclosed a $2,522 medical collection account (alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b); and he disclosed
a credit card account that was more than 120 days past due in the amount of $193
(alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c) He did not disclose any other adverse financial accounts,
including the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d–1.i. 
Applicant has explained that he made an honest mistake by not disclosing the
additional delinquent accounts.  He further explained that when he completed the7
security clearance application, he relied on credit reports that he obtained on October
28, 2012,  which he provided in reply to the FORM. The first credit report contains nine8
adverse accounts of which only three were listed as 120 days past due.  The second9
report contains eight adverse accounts of which one is listed as 120 days past due.10
And those are three of the delinquent accounts he disclosed in his security clearance
application.    
The SOR alleged nine accounts in amounts ranging from $213 to $2,522 for a
total of about $8,710 in some form of delinquency. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant
addressed each account and provided documentary information showing that he had

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As12
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt13
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An14

unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  15
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting16
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An17
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate18
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme19
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it22
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 24
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  25
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more26 27
than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions.  
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  Given the evidence here,28
I have considered the following:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to replay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.

 AG ¶ 15. 31

Applicant’s financial problems are related to his unemployment, a ten-month
period that immediately preceded completion of the security clearance application.
Indeed, losing a job is one of the most common reasons for falling behind on bills and
defaulting on financial obligations. Once he began working for his current employer in
about December 2012, he took prompt and reasonable steps to address his financial
problems. He resolved six of the nine delinquent debts in February 2013 (a few months
before the SOR was issued), and he resolved the remaining debts a few months later in
May 2013. Given these circumstances, Applicant earns substantial credit under the two
mitigating circumstances mentioned above. 
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and29
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.30
Based on the available evidence, I am persuaded that Applicant has taken enough
significant actions to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. 
Under Guideline E for personal conduct, the concern is that “[c]onduct involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and
ability to protest classified information.”  In addition to those general matters, “[o]f31
special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security
clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance

process.”  A statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An32
omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if, for example, the
person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the
question, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be reported.
Here, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his November 2012 security
clearance application by failing to disclose several delinquent debts. I have considered
the arguments of Department Counsel, and I am not persuaded that Applicant
deliberately omitted, concealed, or falsified material facts when answering the relevant
question. I reach this conclusion based on the following: (1) he answered Question 26 in
the affirmative and disclosed four delinquent debts, one of which had already been paid;
(2) he disclosed three debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.c) based on two credit reports he obtained
in late October 2012; and (3) he provided copies of those credit reports thereby
confirming his reliance on those reports. Given these circumstances, it is difficult to
believe Applicant was endeavoring to hide or misrepresent his adverse financial record. 
After weighing the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating
the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant presented33
sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the security concerns. In doing
so, I gave Applicant credit for his favorable character evidence and his work in support
of the U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan. Accordingly, I conclude he has met his ultimate
burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.i: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant
Subparagraph 2.a: For Applicant

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
