Decision
______________
HENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) on August 3, 2011. The Department of Defense (DOD) issued
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 29, 2013, detailing security
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February
20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the
Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information
(AG), implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
W hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the Government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient1
to prove controverted allegations. Directive, ¶ E3.1.14. “That burden has two components. First, the
Government must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took
place. Second, the Government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and
events and a legitimate security concern.” See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),
(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection
between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See
ISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,
2009).

Applicant received the SOR on April 8, 2013, and he answered it on April 30,
2013. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge with the Defense Office of
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July
22, 2013, and I received the case assignment on July 25, 2013. DOHA issued a Notice
of Hearing on August 7, 2013, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 29,
2013. The Government offered exhibits (GE) marked as GE 1 through GE 5, which
were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and his wife
testified. He submitted exhibits (AE) marked as AE A through AE J, which were
received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing
transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2013. I held the record open for Applicant to submit
additional matters. Applicant timely submitted AE K - AE U, which were received and
admitted without objection. The record closed on September 20, 2013.
Procedural Ruling
Motion
At the hearing, Department Counsel made an oral Motion to Strike SOR
allegation 1.f because the debt had been resolved in 2007. Applicant, through his
representative, did not object. The motion was granted. SOR allegation 1.f is stricken
from the record. (Tr. 9-10)
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-
1.k of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for1
eligibility for a security clearance. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence
of record, I make the following findings of fact.  
Applicant, who is 32 years old, works as a network engineer for a DOD
contractor. He began his current employment almost four years ago. His supervisor,
who is also a friend through church, describes him as hardworking and honest. He
further opines that Applicant acts with integrity and honor and has high morals. A long-
time family friend also wrote that Applicant showed a strong work ethic, a sense of

responsibility, great leadership skills, dependability, and honesty. Neither individual
indicated an awareness of his financial problems.2
Applicant and his wife married in August 2003. They have two daughters, ages 8
and 3, and a son, age 7. One year ago, at the suggestion of his parents, Applicant and
his wife decided to move into his parents’home for financial reasons and to help with the
care of Applicant’s grandmother.3
Applicant currently attends college part time, working towards a bachelor’s
degree. He expects to graduate in February 2014. At the present time, his student loans
are in deferment. Because of work-related travel and a heavy workload, Applicant did
not attend school from August 2012 until August 2013. From October 2012 until August
2013, he made the $180 monthly payments on his student loans, which he had
consolidated.4
Applicant currently earns $5,944 a month in gross income and receives $4,059 a
month in net income. His wife does not work. Since he started living with his parents, he
does not pay rent.  Because his parents live in a more rural area and he had two old5
vehicles which did not operate well on the road to his parents home, he purchased a
newer vehicle one year ago. After the hearing, Applicant and his wife refinanced their
car loan, which reduced the monthly payment from $475 to $380.  Applicant’s other6
monthly expenses include $525 for groceries, $350 for utilities, $155 for cell phone, $95
for television, $100 for daughter’s medical (dental) bill, $50 for internet, $500 for
gasoline, $412 for church tithing, $94 for car insurance, $150 on credit card debts, $100
into savings for debt payments, $230 on miscellaneous items, and $255 towards old
debt,for total monthly expenses of approximately $3,500. He has a remainder of $500
for periodic or unanticipated expenses such as car maintenance or repairs and for his
student loans as the payments will resume once he graduates from college.7
The SOR identified 11 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit
reports from 2011 and 2013, totaling approximately $49,742. Some accounts have been
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts
are referenced repeatedly in both credit reports, in many instances duplicating other
accounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agency name or under a
SOR; AE L; AE M; AE Q; Tr. 9-10, 62-65.8
Applicant and his wife testified that SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e were the same debt. Confusion about these two9
debts and SOR § 1.a persisted throughout the hearing. Applicant’s hearing documentation and his post-
hearing documentation clarified these debts. AE F; AE N; AE O.
The credit reports dated January 25, 2013 and July 10, 2013 reflect that Applicant disputed this debts. GE10

different creditor or collection agency name. Some accounts are identified by complete
account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some
instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.
The Government acknowledged that the $1,370 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f had
been paid in 2007. This debt is resolved, and at the Government’s request, it has been
stricken from the record. The $23,186 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c and the $10,267 debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d are for two vehicle repossessions. Applicant and his wife bought
two cars when they were young. They could not afford the car payments, and the cars
were repossessed. His wife contacted the creditor for both debts. The creditor for the
smaller debt advised that their total debt is now $9,836 and that it would be willing to
work out a payment plan. Applicant and his wife plan to start payment in March or April
2014. Applicant’s wife also spoke with the collection agent for the largest SOR debt.
This company indicated that it would accept $100 a month payment for six months
before it would discuss payoff options. Applicant cannot begin these payments until the
middle of 2014.8
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e are the same debt.  The three credit reports dated9
August 25, 2011, January 25, 2013 and July 10, 2013 show that the $2,000 debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a had been sold or transferred and that the original creditor, as listed in SOR ¶
1.a, listed the account as closed with a zero balance. Applicant’s August 7, 2013 credit
report reflected this same information, and in addition, it showed that this account was
sold to the collection agency identified in SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,087) who changed the account
number. The collection agency identified in SOR ¶ 1.e is no longer in business. The
August 7, 2013 credit report indicated that the collection agency in SOR ¶ 1.b ($4,150)
purchased this debt. The account number in SOR ¶ 1.b is the same as the account
number SOR ¶ 1.a.  The August 7, 2013 credit report and the August 7, 201310
settlement offer show the name of the original creditor as the name identified in SOR ¶
1.e. Applicant and the collection agency in SOR ¶ 1.b have agreed to settle this debt for
$1,250. Applicant began paying $250 a month in August 2013 with a final payment due
in December 2013. He also resolved one small debt not listed in the SOR.11
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($725) and 1.k ($938) are also held by the collection
agency identified in SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant agreed to a three-month payment of $316
beginning in January 2014 to resolve these debts. Applicant also contacted the creditor
for the medical debts identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($564) and 1.h ($147). The creditor

agreed to a $50 a month payment beginning in 2014. Finally, the collection agency for
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($2,317) advised Applicant that it was deleting the debt from the
credit reports. The collection agency provided no reason for its decision. With this
decision, Applicant cannot pay the collection agency. The debt is not listed on the
January 25, 2103, the July 10, 2013, or the August 7, 2013 credit reports under the
name of the original creditor or the collection agency. The current owner and status of
this debt is unknown, making it impossible to pay.  12
Applicant provided a copy of his federal and state tax returns for the years 2008
through 2012. His tax returns show the following gross income: $82,288 in 2008,
$70,796 in 2009, $59,979 in 2010, $62,999 in 2011, and $67,282 in 2012. The tax
returns also reflect that for the years 2011 and 2012, Applicant received a tax refund of
more than $3,800 each year. Applicant has not explained how this money was used. He
also received a $1,000 bonus in August 2013. His net bonus payment was $673.
Although he has not explained how he spent this money, testimony reflected that his
oldest daughter required dental work which cost $1,700. This expense is now being paid
at the rate of $100 a month and is expected to be paid in full by the summer of 2014. It
is likely the bonus money was applied to this expense.13
 
Applicant explained that his debts arose because he and his wife made
inappropriate and uneducated financial decisions when they were younger, poorly
planned their finances, and did not have sufficient income. Eventually they became
overwhelmed by their debts. They took one financial counseling session and followed
the counselor’s advice to cut spending. They also worked on reducing their spending
habits in the six months before the hearing.14
Applicant and his wife have developed a payment plan to resolve their old debts,
while continuing to pay their regular monthly expenses. Under their plan, they will pay
$250 a month to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e by December 2013. In
January 2014, they begin payments of $316 a month to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i
and 1.k. By spring 2014, they plan to begin payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d and by
summer, they expect to begin payments on the debts in ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. They are saving
$100 a month towards their debts.  15
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative. In addition to brief introductory
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying
6
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available,
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in
making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based
on the evidence contained in the record.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” An
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security
decision.
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in AG & 18:      
7
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
AG ¶ 19 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.
I have considered all the conditions, and the following are potentially applicable: 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
Applicant developed significant financial problems from poor financial decision-
making and inappropriate spending habits. Most of the debts have not been resolved.
These two disqualifying conditions apply.
The Financial Considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that
can mitigate security concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG ¶ 20(a) through
¶ 20(f), and the following are potentially applicable:
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control; and
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts.
Applicant consolidated his school loans and began payments in October 2012.
His school loans are current and in deferment while he attends school. With the help of
his wife, he began to contact creditors about the resolution of his debts. He settled one
small debt and developed a payment plan for one debt. He and his wife moved to his
parents home, which eliminated a monthly rent payment, but required the purchase of a
newer car, creating a monthly car payment. He and his wife took the advice of a
financial counselor and cut their spending. He has sufficient income each month to meet
his monthly expenses and to pay towards his debts. These mitigating conditions are
applicable. Even if the security concerns are not resolved by the mitigating conditions,
security concerns are resolved under the whole-person analysis.
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):
8
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or
deny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both
favorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the
evidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is
established and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant’s eligibility
for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,
but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a
nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. 
In assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,
the Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3
(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and
every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2
(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant
demonstrate that he has “. . . established a plan to resolve his financial
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can
reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about the person, past
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching
a determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such
debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.
Apr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually
paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the
SOR.
9
The evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the
whole-person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In
reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant’s
financial problems began when he and his wife were young and made poor financial
decisions. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) His 2008 tax return reflected a good income, which was
inappropriately used. His income declined over the next two years by more than
$20,000. Since 2011, his income has slowly increased, but is still about $14,000 a year
lower than his earnings in 2008. His debts reflect poor choices about how to spend
household income, including unnecessary spending. He received several tax refunds in
excess of $3,800, but it does not appear that this money was used to resolve his debts.
His budget reflects that he has sufficient income to make a $50 monthly payment on his
medical debts. 
Applicant has taken positive steps to address his finances. He and his family
moved into his parents home to reduce rental costs. He has contacted creditors in an
effort to determine which debts he owes and to work out a resolution of his debts. His
efforts resulted in the resolution of three debts totaling $8,404, a current payment plan
for a fourth debt ($4,150), and future payment plans for four small debts totaling $2,374
and one larger debt ($10,267) once the current debt payment is concluded. He also
saves $100 a month to resolve debts. One SOR debt was paid in 2007. He has
developed a plan to repay his debts, one at a time. His plan does not negatively impact
his ability to pay his current obligations nor does it deprive his family of necessities,
such as food and medical care. He paid his school debts as required and recently
renegotiated his car loan to reduce his monthly payment and increase his income
available for debt payment. He is focused on resolving his debts, but it will take time. He
is married and has three children. As a result, he has focused his attention on providing
a stable domestic environment for his family. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative
action towards the resolution of the delinquent debts raising security concerns. (See AG
& 2(a)(6).) Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid: it is whether
his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.
While some debts remain unpaid, they do not raise security concerns. (See AG &
2(a)(1).) Applicant’s efforts over the last year to take control of his fiances and his old
debts reflects positively on him and overcome his poor financial decision-making in the
past. Applicant has taken sufficient steps towards the resolution of his debts to mitigate
the security concerns raised about his finances.
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under
Guideline F.

Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.f: Stricken from the SOR
Subparagraphs 1.g-1.k: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
