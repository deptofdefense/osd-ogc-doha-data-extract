GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct and 
financial considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 7, 2008, Applicant submitted a Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 
108).1 On May 21, 2008, he submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF 
85).2 On November 19, 2010, he applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).3 On August 15, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the

interrogatories on September 21, 2012.4 On an unspecified date, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories, but failed to have his response 
dated or notarized.5 On April 2, 2013, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make a preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 10, 2013. In a statement, 
dated and notarized April 18, 2013,6 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
June 3, 2013, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on June 14, 2013, but as of August 26, 2013, 
he had not submitted any further documents or other information. The case was 
assigned to me on August 27, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct and financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a.-1.p., 
and 2.a.). Applicant’s admissions and other comments are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a field service representative (FSR) since January 2010. He was previously 
employed in quality assurance and quality control, as a lead mechanic, and as a 
mechanic.7 He was unemployed from December 2004 until January 2005, and from

December 2009 until January 2010.8 Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with the 
U.S. Army from May 2001 until February 2004.9 He was administratively discharged 
under honorable conditions with a general discharge certificate due to misconduct.10 He 
graduated from high school in June 2000.11 Applicant has never been married.12 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 Applicant has a lengthy history of inappropriate and criminal conduct, 
characterized for the purposes of his security clearance review as personal conduct, 
commencing in 2001, and it has continued through at least November 2010. In 
December 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.a.), Applicant stole an estimated $600 from a fellow military 
billet-mate by wrongfully using the automated teller machine (ATM) card and personal 
identification number (PIN) belonging to that individual.13 As a result of his actions, 
Applicant was charged with larceny of private funds, in violation or Article 121, Uniform 
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and administered nonjudicial punishment under Article 
15, UCMJ. He was reduced one grade from E3 to E2 (suspended), given extra duty for 
45 days, restricted for 45 days, and fined (suspended).14  
 
In September 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.b.), Applicant lost his military identification card.15 
As a result of his actions, he was charged with one specification of dereliction in the 
performance of his duties, in violation or Article 92, UCMJ, and administered nonjudicial 
punishment under Article 15, UCMJ. He was given extra duty for 14 days, and restricted 
for 14 days.16  
 
In June 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.c.), Applicant tested positive for marijuana during a 
random sample urinalysis.17 He confessed to using marijuana.18 As a result of his

actions, he was charged with one specification of wrongful use of marijuana, in violation 
or Article 112a, UCMJ, and ordered to stand trial at a Summary Court Martial. He was 
found guilty and sentenced to be confined for 30 days, and ordered to forfeit $767.19  
 
Between May and July 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.d.), Applicant wrongfully broke into 
several automobiles and stole a variety of stereo equipment, including car amplifiers, 
speakers, compact disc players, and other unspecified property.20 As a result of his 
actions, he was charged with two specifications of attempt to commit larceny, in 
violation of Article 80, UCMJ; one specification of conspiracy to commit larceny, in 
violation of Article 81, UCMJ; one specification of wrongfully damaging the property of 
another, in violation of Article 109, UCMJ; and three specifications of larceny, in 
violation of Article 121, UCMJ. He stood trial at a Summary Court Martial, and pled 
guilty to all the charges. He was convicted as charged, and sentenced to be confined for 
30 days, and ordered to forfeit $767.21 
 
In about January 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.e.), Applicant tested positive for marijuana 
during a random sample urinalysis.22 He confessed to using marijuana.23 Instead of 
disciplining Applicant through nonjudicial or judicial punishment, this time the command 
chose to process him for administrative separation.24 
 
In about August 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.f.), Applicant was stopped by the police for 
speeding. Following a search of his vehicle, to which he had consented, Applicant was 
arrested and charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, to wit: brass knuckles.25 
He was eventually fined an unspecified amount.26  
 
 On April 7, 2008, when Applicant completed and submitted his OF 108, he 
responded to several questions set forth therein. In response to Question 8 - (Have you 
ever served in the United States military? If you answered “yes,” list the branch, dates, 
and type of discharge for all active duty.), Applicant stated he had received an

 Item 16, supra note 17. In May 2001, upon entering active duty, Applicant acknowledged receipt of the 
Army’s policy on alcohol and drug abuse. “Any drug abuse by soldiers of the United States Army is against the law, 
violates Army standards of behavior and duty performance, and will not be tolerated.” See, Item 11 (Statement of 
Understanding (Army Policy), dated May 3, 2001).

honorable discharge (SOR ¶ 1.g.).27 In fact, Applicant was administratively discharged 
under honorable conditions with a general discharge certificate due to misconduct.28 
Applicant deliberately chose to falsify his response to the question in an effort to 
conceal the true nature of his prior military service.29  
 
In response to Question 9 of the OF 108 - (During the last 10 years, have you 
been convicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on parole? (Includes 
felonies, firearms or explosives violations, misdemeanors, and all other offenses.)), as 
well as to Question 10 of the OF 108 - (Have you been convicted by a military court-
martial in the past 10 years?), Applicant answered “no” (SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.i.).30 In fact, 
Applicant failed to disclose that he had been convicted following his two courts-martial, 
as set forth above. Applicant deliberately chose to falsify his responses to the questions 
in an effort to conceal the true nature of his criminal record.31  
 
On November 19, 2010, when Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86, he 
responded to several questions set forth therein. In response to § 15a - (Have you 
EVER served in the United States military or the U.S. Merchant Marine?), Applicant 
answered “no” (SOR ¶ 1.j.).32 In fact, Applicant failed to disclose that he had served in 
the U.S. Army from May 2001 until February 2004. Applicant deliberately chose to 
falsify his response to the question in an effort to conceal his military service.33 
  
In response to § 15b of the SF 86 - (Have you EVER received a discharge that 
was not honorable?), Applicant answered “no” (SOR ¶ 1.k.).34 In fact, Applicant was 
administratively discharged under honorable conditions with a general discharge 
certificate due to misconduct.35 Applicant deliberately chose to falsify his response to 
the question in an effort to conceal the true nature of his prior military service.36  
 
In response to § 22b of the SF 86 - ([In the last 7 years], have you been arrested 
by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any other type of law enforcement officer?), 
Applicant answered “no” (SOR ¶ 1.l.).37 In fact, in August 2006, Applicant was arrested

and charged with possession of a prohibited weapon (brass knuckles). Applicant 
deliberately chose to falsify his response to the question in an effort to conceal the true 
nature of his criminal record.38  
 
In response to § 22e of the SF 86 - (Have you EVER been charged with any 
offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?), Applicant answered “no” (SOR ¶ 1.m.).39 In fact, 
Applicant failed to disclose that he had been charged and convicted of marijuana use in 
2003, as set forth above. Applicant deliberately chose to falsify his response to the 
question in an effort to conceal his history of substance abuse.40 While the SOR alleged 
that Applicant also tried to hide his 2004 marijuana-related misconduct, the evidence 
fails to support such an allegation, for while there is evidence of a failed random 
urinalysis, and a subsequent administrative separation action for misconduct, there is 
no evidence that Applicant was ever “charged” with a 2004 violation of Article 112a, 
UCMJ. 
 
The SOR also alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose complete 
information in response to another question, but the allegation is garbled as it combines 
two different questions. It refers to § 27a - (In the last 7 years, have you illegally or 
without proper authorization entered into any information technology system?), but 
quotes § 23a – (In the last 7 years, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for 
example, . . . THC (marijuana, hashish, etc.) . . .?). Appellant answered “no” to the 
combined questions (SOR ¶ 1.n.).41 The SOR further alleged that Applicant deliberately 
failed to disclose his use of marijuana as recently as 2009. While Applicant 
subsequently admitted both the deliberate falsification and the 2009 marijuana use,42 
the allegation, as drafted, is too defective and misleading to be of any significant value.  
 
During his personal subject interview with an investigator of the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) in December 2010, Applicant furnished the investigator 
false and erroneous information pertaining to his use of marijuana (SOR ¶ 1.o.). He 
admitted marijuana use at parties one or two times per month from about January 2003 
until December 2003, but denied further marijuana use since that time.43 However, in 
September 2012, in response to interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he had smoked 
one joint of marijuana every other week from March 2003 until May 2004, and again 
from August 2009, until October 2009.44 Applicant deliberately chose to falsify his 
response to the question in an effort to conceal his true history of substance abuse.45

During the same 2010 OPM interview, Applicant also stated that while he had 
received a general discharge from the Army, after a period of six months, the discharge 
would be upgraded to an honorable discharge.46 That position is directly contradicted by 
what was expressly stated in his election of rights for separation signed by him shortly 
before he was administratively separated from the Army:47 
 
I understand that I may expect to encounter substantial prejudice in 
civilian life if a general discharge under honorable conditions is issued to 
me. . . . I understand that if I receive a discharge/characterization of 
service that is less than honorable, I may make application to the Army 
Discharge Review Board or the Army Board for Correction of Military 
Records for upgrading; however, I realize that an act of consideration by 
either board does not imply that my discharge will be upgraded. 
 
There is no evidence that Applicant ever applied for an upgrade of his discharge 
characterization.  
   
Personal Conduct & Financial Considerations 
 
 As of October 9, 2012, Applicant had not filed his federal income tax form 1040 
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax year 2003.48 As of July 4, 2011, he 
had not filed his federal income tax form 1040 with the IRS for the tax year 2004,49 but 
he finally did so on July 11, 2011.50 Substitute tax returns were prepared by the IRS 
because of his failures to file them for the tax years 2005 and 2006.51 As of December 
10, 2012, he had not filed his federal income tax form 1040 with the IRS for the tax year 
2007.52 Applicant admitted not filing his income tax returns for 2003 and 2007,53 and 
attributed his failures to having been unemployed.54 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”55 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”56   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”57 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.58  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”59 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”60 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities, is potentially disqualifying. Also, deliberately providing false or 
misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security 
official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative, may 
raise security concerns under AG ¶ 16(b). In addition, security concerns may be raised 
under AG ¶ 16(c), where there is credible adverse information in several adjudicative 
issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,

 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531

 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating 
that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. 
 
Applicant served in with the U.S. Army from May 2001 until February 2004, and 
on numerous occasions during that period, he committed a variety of wrongful and 
illegal acts, resulting in nonjudicial punishment and courts martial. He was finally 
administratively discharged under honorable conditions with a general discharge 
certificate due to his misconduct. Repeated punishment did not serve as a deterrent, for 
he was subsequently arrested for possession of a prohibited weapon. When questioned 
regarding his history of military service, substance abuse, and criminal history, he lied 
and tried to conceal the substantial negative issues from his past. Applicant certified 
that his responses to questions were “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] 
knowledge and belief,” but he deliberately falsified responses and concealed critical 
information in his employment and security clearance applications in 2008 and 2010, as 
well as during his 2010 security interview. Applicant admitted not filing his income tax 
returns for 2003 and 2007. AG ¶¶ 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c) have been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct, but none of them apply. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(g), failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same may raise security concerns. 
Applicant’s failure to file his 2003 and 2007 income tax returns, is well-documented. 
While the evidence reflects his failure to file his income tax returns, there is no evidence 
that it was based on Applicant’s inability or unwillingness to do so. His only explanation 
pertained to his previous brief periods of unemployment, and those periods occurred 
from December 2004 until January 2005, and from December 2009 until January 2010. 
AG 19(g) has been established. AG ¶ 19(a) has not been established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial considerations, but none of them apply.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.61       
There is very little evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His military 
service was such that he was was administratively discharged under honorable 
conditions with a general discharge certificate due to misconduct. There are no positive 
characterizations as to his reputation for honesty, integrity, truthfulness or good work 
performance. Instead, he simply avers that “in the last few years, I have not committed 
any acts that would generate you to question my judgment, integrity, or my behavior.” 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has an extensive history of criminal activity, including his repeated larceny 
incidents, his repeated use of marijuana, his dereliction of duty, his arrest for 
possession of a prohibited weapon, and his administrative discharge under honorable 
conditions with a general discharge certificate due to misconduct. In addition, there are 
his repeated incidents of deliberately falsifying material facts and concealing the true 
facts about his military history, drug involvement, and criminal history. Applicant 
exhibited a cavalier attitude regarding compliance with rules, regulations, and the law, 
as well as for truthfulness. Applicant’s actions indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise 
questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
