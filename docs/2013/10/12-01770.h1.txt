DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 12, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action 
was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
On July 1, 2013, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on August 9, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 28, 2013, and the hearing was 
convened as scheduled on September 13, 2013. At the hearing, Department Counsel 
offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 that were admitted into evidence 
 
2 
 
without objection. Applicant testified, offered no exhibits, and called no witnesses. The 
record was left open until October 1, 2013, to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit 
additional matters. He timely submitted documents that were marked as Applicant’s 
Exhibits (AE) A through F and admitted into evidence without objection. Department 
Counsel’s email forwarding Applicant’s post-hearing submission was marked as 
Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 23, 
2013. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
At the hearing, Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement in 
Paragraph E3.1.8 of the Directive.1 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for his current employer in Afghanistan since March 2010. He graduated from 
high school in 1991, earned an associate’s degree in 2004, and earned a bachelor’s 
degree in 2006. He married in 1994 and divorced in 2010. He has two children, a son 
18 years old and daughter 16 years old. He has held a security clearance in the past 
without incident.2  
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts, totaling $52,196. 
Four of those debts, totaling $51,556, are student loans. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted each debt with comments. His admissions are incorporated as 
findings of fact.3 
 
 Applicant worked in Iraq from July 2006 to November 2009. During that period, 
he owned a house in the United States. In about 2008, he and his wife decided to build 
a second house in the same metropolitan area as the first home. They moved into the 
second house and initially rented the first house. In 2008, Applicant learned that his wife 
was having an affair. They separated and she moved back into the first house. She 
failed to make the mortgage payments on the first house for about a year and a half. 
The first house was eventually disposed of in a short sale. They divorced in May 2010. 
Applicant acquired the second house and indicated that he has not been delinquent on 
its mortgage payments for the past two years.4 
 
 While working in Iraq in October 2009, Applicant was disciplined following a 
disagreement with a supervisor over the use of a restroom facility. Following that 
incident, a Human Resources Review Board decided to terminate Applicant’s

employment, but gave him the option of resigning in lieu of termination. He chose the 
resignation. In his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he 
acknowledged that his marital problems had affected his work performance and his 
attitude. Following his resignation, he was unemployed or underemployed until he 
obtained his current job in March 2010.5 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b – unpaid medical debts of $33 and $458. These debts were 
placed for collection in April and June 2009. Both debts had the same account number. 
Applicant testified that both debts were paid on May 1, 2013. In his post-hearing 
submission, he provided a bank record showing that he made a payment of $491 (the 
combined total of both debts) on that date. These debts are resolved.6 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.c – student loan placed for collection for $2,244. This debt had a date of 
first delinquency/date of last activity of November 2009. At the hearing, Applicant 
testified that he paid this student loan. In post-hearing submission, he provided a bank 
record showing he made student loan payments of $500 and $1,662 in August 2013 to 
a state student loan program. This debt is being resolved.7 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d, and 1.e – student loans placed for collection for $2,483 and $5,829.  
These debts had dates of first delinquency/dates of last activity of October 2008 and 
November 2009. Applicant testified that these two student loans were consolidated by a 
collection company and that he had been making payments of $100 toward them for a 
number of months. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a bank record showing 
these debts are being resolved. The bank record reflected the following payments to the 
creditor:8

 SOR ¶ 1.f – student loan placed for collection for $41,000. This debt had a date 
of first delinquency/date of last activity of October 2008. Applicant testified that he had 
been making monthly payments to rehabilitate this loan. In his post-hearing submission, 
he provided a bank record showing that he made monthly payments of $208 from 
March to August 2013. This debt is being resolved.9 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g – account placed for collection for $149. This was a cable television 
debt. Applicant testified that he paid this debt. He also noted that it no longer appears 
on his credit reports. None of the credit reports admitted into evidence listed this debt. 
This debt is resolved.10 
 
 Applicant testified that he has not received financial counseling. In a personal 
financial statement submitted in May 2013, he indicated that he had a net monthly 
income of $11,384, that he had monthly expenses of $2,936, and that he had monthly 
debt payments of $2,749, which left him a net monthly remainder of $5,699. He also 
listed that his total assets were $266,000, which included $30,000 in bank savings, 
$1,000 in stocks/bonds, and the value of his car and house.11 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
6 
 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay 
for an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Several financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant encountered marital difficulties in 2008 and obtained a divorce in 2010. 
His marital difficulties were a condition beyond his control that contributed to his 
financial problems. Since March 2010, he has taken steps to rehabilitate his student 
loans and pay his other debts. He has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that his 
financial problems are being resolved and are under control. He understands the 
importance of paying his debts in a timely manner and these problems are unlikely to 
recur. AG ¶ 20(c) fully applies and AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) partially apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
7 
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has served with the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was open 
and forthcoming during the hearing. He is on track to resolve his financial problems, and 
it is unlikely that they will recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no 
questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under 
the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.g:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
