HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 38 delinquent or charged-off debts, 
totaling $27,440. Twenty-seven of her debts were mitigated as 19 were disputed 
medical debts, and 8 non-medical disputed debts were removed from her credit report. 
She did not provide any documentation showing attempts to establish payment plans or 
to resolve her 11 remaining delinquent debts, totaling $19,115. She did not make any 
payments to address any of her SOR debts. She failed to make sufficient progress 
resolving her financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 8, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 4) On April 19, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On May 29 and June 10, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
waived her right to a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM), dated August 2, 2013, was provided to her on August 15, 2013. She was 
afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was 
assigned to me on October 21, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
SOR Response3 
 
Applicant admitted the 23 medical debts originated with her that were listed in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($267), 1.c ($883), 1.d ($114), 1.e ($115), 1.f ($114), 1.g ($406), 1.h ($378), 
1.i ($184), 1.l ($111), 1.m ($534), 1.n ($59), 1.o ($81), 1.p ($564), 1.q ($224), 1.r ($179), 
1.t ($75), 1.u ($325), 1.w ($606), 1.aa ($92), 1.cc ($130), 1.dd ($688), 1.ee ($98), and 
1.hh ($82); however, she said those debts are the responsibility of worker’s 
compensation, were sent to her attorney, and are being removed from her credit report.4 
Her April 16, 2013 credit report shows 14 unpaid medical debts in the amounts of: $267, 
$883, $114, $115, $114, $406, $378, $184, $111, $534, $59, $81, $564, and $224, 
which match the amounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.i, 1.l to 1.p and 1.q. The other medical 
debts listed in the SOR are not in her April 16, 2013 credit report.  
 
Applicant denied responsibility for seven debts and included the following 
explanations: (1) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($486) has been removed from her credit 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated August 12, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 
15, 2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after her receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3The source for all of the facts in this paragraph is Applicant’s May 29 and June 10, 2013 SOR 
response. (Item 2) There were no enclosures or supporting documentation to support the assertions 
made in Applicant’s SOR response. 
 
4In some instances the SOR listed the collection agent and not the identity of the original creditor. 
Department Counsel provided the identity of the original creditor for the debts in SOR ¶ 1.w ($606), 1.cc 
($130), 1.dd ($688), and 1.hh ($82) and explained they were not medical creditors. (FORM at 8-9) 
Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  Applicant and Department Counsel agree that Applicant has 19 
SOR medical debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i, 1.l-1.r, 1.t, 1.u, 1.aa, and 1.ee. Those 19 SOR medical debts 
total $4,803.

reports; (2) For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($475), she returned the equipment received from 
a telecommunications company, and the debt was removed from her credit report; (3)–
(6) She attempted to find out more information about the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.s ($72), 1.v 
($107), 1.x ($1,175), and 1.gg ($797); however, she was unable to establish her 
responsibility for any of these debts; and (7) She requested removal of the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.ii ($353) from her credit reports without describing why it should be removed. 
Applicant admitted responsibility for two debts and explained why they were mitigated: 
(1) The insurance debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($210) “was taken care of” and removed from her 
credit report; and (2) She requested removal of the bank debt in SOR ¶ 1.jj ($323) from 
her credit report without explaining why it should be removed from her credit report. 
Applicant did not provide any credit reports. Applicant’s April 16, 2013 credit report 
included the delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($486); however, it did not include the other 
eight debts. 
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for five debts and included the following 
information: (1)-(2) Two bank debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.y ($3,285) and 1.z ($4,754) are owed 
to the same creditor, and she is working with the creditor to establish a payment plan; 
(3) She is attempting to contact the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.bb ($186); and (4) She 
contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.ff ($135) for more information. Her 
admissions in her SOR response are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
SOR Amendment 
  
In the FORM, Department Counsel requested amendment of the SOR as follows: 
(1) reduction of the amount of the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.d from $11,400 to $114; (2) 
increase of the amount of the insurance debt in SOR ¶ 1.ii from “35.003” to $353; (3) 
addition of a student loan debt delinquent 120 days or more in SOR ¶ 1.kk ($5,182); 
and (4) addition of a student loan debt delinquent 120 days or more in SOR ¶ 1.ll 
($3,581). (FORM at 2-3) Applicant did not object to the four amendments, and I 
approved the four amendments of the SOR.   
 
Applicant is 35 years old, and she was employed as an alarm dispatcher from 
April 2011 to completion of her SF 86 in July 2011.5 She has never been married, and 
she does not have any children. She graduated from high school in 1995. She attended 
several colleges, and she received a diploma or certificate rather than a degree. She 
has never served in the military. There is no evidence of criminal arrests or convictions. 
There is no evidence of use of illegal drugs or alcohol abuse. 
 
Applicant was unemployed four times in the last eight years: (1) October 2005 to 
December 2005; (2) March 2006 to August 2006; (3) September 2008 to May 2010; and 
(4) January to April 2011.   
 
In 2000, Applicant injured her ankle, and she was living on worker’s 
compensation from September 2000 to March 2005. From March 2005 to October 
                                            
5Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s July 8, 2011 SF 86 is the basis for the facts in this 
paragraph and the next two paragraphs. (Item 4)

2005, she was a claims examiner for a medical company. From December 2005 to 
March 2006, she was a medical biller in a medical billing office. From August 2006 to 
September 2008, she worked in collections in a medical area. From May 2010 to 
January 2011, she was a billing manager.  
 
On October 13, 2011, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant about her finances and discussed numerous delinquent debts 
with her. (Item 6) Some of her debts became delinquent due to moving, loss of 
employment, medical problems, and insufficient income. She was injured at work in 
2000, and she underwent two ankle surgeries over a two or three year period. For five 
weeks in 2010, Applicant received two thirds of her pay, while on disability due to 
pneumonia. In the last five years, she had a lap band procedure, suffered some 
complications, and had the lap band removed. She has never received financial 
counseling. 
 
Applicant’s credit reports, October 13, 2011 OPM personal subject interview 
(PSI), response to interrogatories from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA), and SOR response, consistently describe her financial problems and 
delinquent debts.     
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement shows her monthly gross salary is 
$2,584; her monthly net salary is $1,946; and her monthly net remainder after 
subtracting expenses is $25.6 The only debt payment is a $150 monthly payment to her 
fitness center, resulting in a negative monthly remainder of $125. She explained that 
she works “overtime to make up the difference.”     
 
The FORM advised Applicant of her opportunity to address the facts in the 
FORM, and notes the absence of documentary evidence such as payments to SOR 
creditors, correspondence to or from creditors, or debt disputes. There is no 
documentary evidence of progress resolving her SOR debts. 
 
The August 12, 2013 DOHA letter conveying the FORM to Applicant invited her 
to “submit any material you wish the Administrative Judge to consider or to make any 
objections you may have as to the information in the file.” Applicant did not provide any 
response to the FORM. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
                                            
6Applicant’s February 12, 2013 personal financial statement is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph. (Item 5 at 4)   
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, OPM PSI, DOHA interrogatories, and SOR response. The record 
establishes Applicant’s SOR lists 38 delinquent or charged-off debts, totaling $27,440.  
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all SOR debts. Applicant’s unemployment, 
underemployment, low income, and medical problems are all financial conditions largely 
beyond her control; however, she did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She 
did not describe any unemployment or changes in her income after April 2011, when 
she received her current employment. She did not describe any payments to her SOR 
creditors in those two years.  
 
Applicant denied responsibility for seven debts and admitted responsibility for two 
debts. She said they were removed from her credit reports. Eight of the nine debts were 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

not listed as delinquent accounts in her April 16, 2013 credit report. I have credited 
Applicant with mitigating the six debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.k, 1.s, 1.v, 1.x, 1.gg, 1.ii, and 1.jj 
that were not included in her most recent credit report.  
 
Applicant and Department Counsel agree that Applicant has 19 SOR medical 
debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i, 1.l-1.r, 1.t, 1.u, 1.aa, and 1.ee. Those 19 SOR medical 
debts total $4,803. Applicant described surgeries for her ankle, lap band surgery, 
removal of the lap band, and a lengthy period where she lived on workman’s 
compensation. Her April 16, 2013 credit report shows 13 unpaid medical debts.  
Applicant acted reasonably by utilizing an attorney to assess her own and her 
employer’s workman’s compensation liability before paying these debts. I have credited 
Applicant with mitigating the 19 SOR debts that are clearly attributed to her medical 
problems. 
 
Applicant’s personal financial statement shows a negative monthly remainder 
and no payments to any of her SOR creditors. She did not establish that over the 
previous two years she could not have reduced her expenses enough to have at least 
settled and paid some of her smaller debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.bb ($186), 1.cc ($130), 1.ff 
($135) and 1.hh ($82)).  
 
Applicant did not describe any payments to any SOR creditors in the last two 
years. She did not provide any documentation, such as a checking account statement, 
photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that she paid or made any 
payments to any SOR creditors. There is no documentation showing financial 
counseling, correspondence to or from creditors, or debt disputes. There is no 
documented evidence of progress resolving her SOR debts. She did not provide 
documentation proving that she maintained contact with her SOR creditors, and she did 
not provide any documentation showing her attempts to negotiate payment plans with 
her SOR creditors.8 There is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being 
resolved and are under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
                                            
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant’s 
finances were adversely affected when she became unemployed, she was under 
employed, and she had medical problems. These were circumstances beyond her 
control. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since April 2011, and 
for the last two years she had stable employment. There is no evidence of criminal 
conduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. She contributes to her company and the 
Department of Defense. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that she would 
intentionally violate national security.   
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. She failed to 
mitigate 11 delinquent debts, totaling $19,115. She could have made greater progress 
resolving and documenting resolution of her delinquent SOR debts. She could have 
settled and paid some of her smaller debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.bb ($186), 1.cc ($130), 1.ff 
($135) and 1.hh ($82)). She did not provide documentary proof that she made any 
payments to any of her SOR creditors or that she attempted to settle any of her 
delinquent debts. She did not provide a plan explaining how she intended to pay any of 
her delinquent SOR debts. Her failure to establish her financial responsibility shows lack 
of judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 15. More 
documented financial progress is necessary to fully mitigate security concerns. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to 
classified information at this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:   For Applicant

Subparagraph 1.ff:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.gg:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.hh:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.ii and 1.jj:  For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
