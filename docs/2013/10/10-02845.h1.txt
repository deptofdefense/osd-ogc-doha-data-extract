Statement of the Case 
 
The Department of Defense (DOD) issued an undated Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR on June 3, 2013, and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
August 22, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing on August 27, 2013, scheduling the hearing for September 23, 2013. The 
 
2 
 
hearing was convened as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
September 30, 2013.  
 
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings 
 
Evidence 
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 1 
through 12, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for 
Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted documents that were marked 
AE 13 through 27 and admitted without objection. Correspondence about the additional 
exhibits is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. 
 
Motion to Amend SOR 
 
Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing the allegations 
under SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. The motion was granted without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is applying for a 
security clearance. He served in the U.S. military from 1982 until he was honorably 
discharged in 1988. He attended college for several years, but he did not earn a degree. 
He married in 1981 and divorced in 2007. He has three adult children from the 
marriage. He remarried in 2007. He has two children from this marriage, and his wife is 
pregnant expecting a third child.1 
 
 Applicant has worked for the same company since about 1988. He worked in 
foreign countries from about 1994 to 2006. His employer paid many of his expenses for 
living overseas, including at times taxes owed to the foreign country. Applicant’s U.S. 
tax situation was complicated by issues such as foreign taxes, income earned overseas, 
and employer-paid expenses being treated as earned income.2 Applicant’s Social 
Security and Medicare earnings record showed the following earnings: 
 
 1994  $60,400   2001  $447,427 
 1995  $184,158   2002  $213,325 
 1996  $132,663   2003  $289,923 
 1997  $257,445   2004  $188,418 
 1998  $280,764   2005  $123,277 
 1999  $435,909   2006  $165,037 
 2000  $249,041   2007  $107,0803

 Applicant’s company provided an accounting firm to assist their employees living 
overseas in filing their U.S. federal income tax returns. Applicant moved from one 
foreign country to another in 2001. That same year, his employer changed accounting 
firms. Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 through 
2006 when they were due. He stated that numerous problems, such as frequent moves 
and difficulties in contacting the new accounting firm, prevented him from filing the 
returns on time. The 2000 to 2005 tax returns were completed in late 2006. Applicant 
testified that he filed the returns in early 2007, but they were mailed to the wrong 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) division. IRS documents state that the 2000 to 2006 
returns were not filed until July to September 2008. His 2007 federal income tax return 
was filed in October 2008.4 
 
 The SOR alleged unpaid federal taxes for tax years 2000 through 2007 (SOR ¶¶ 
1.c - 1.j), totaling about $258,000. Applicant denied owing the IRS for tax years 2000 to 
2002, stating those taxes have been resolved. He admits owing the IRS for tax years 
2003 through 2007. The below table lists Applicant’s tax liability, before adding interest 
and penalties, for tax years 2000 to 2007 and the amount withheld from his paycheck 
for federal taxes during the pertinent tax years: 
  
 Tax year  Tax liability  Amount withheld 
  
 2000   $38,199  $0 
 2001   $49,880  $0 
 2002   $9,370  $769 
 2003   $32,565  $0 
 2004   $14,314  $05 
 2005   $6,096  $0 
 2006   $20,629  $15,561 
 2007   $38,418  $36,2526 
 
 Applicant moved back to the United States in 2006. With the exception of the 
amount withheld from his pay check, he made no additional payments toward his tax 
debt until the IRS began levying his pay in 2008. In January 2009, Applicant and the 
IRS reached an installment agreement. Applicant paid $250 per week through January 
2011, at which time a new installment agreement was entered for monthly payments of 
$1,512. Applicant made the monthly $1,512 payments through January 2013. His tax 
refunds have also been seized by the IRS and applied to his tax debt. He testified that 
he has continued to make the monthly payments, and that he has paid about $200,000 
to the IRS for his delinquent taxes. He stated that he believes he owes the IRS about 
$180,000. IRS documents from May 2013 establish that taxes for years 2000 to 2002

with $763 for excess Social Security and “tier 1 RRTA tax withheld.”

have been paid, and that Applicant owes about $109,000,7 including penalties and 
interest, for tax years 2003 through 2007.8 
 
 In 2011, a state (State A) filed a tax lien of about $6,800 against Applicant for tax 
year 2007. Applicant denied owing taxes to State A, stating that he did not live or work 
in the state during 2007. He indicated that he lived in another state (State B), and that 
he owes State B more than $10,000.9 He has not filed a tax return for State B for tax 
year 2007. His company withheld $2,071 from his 2007 pay for his tax obligation to 
State A. Applicant stated that after he files a tax return with State B, State A will 
acknowledge that he does not owe taxes to State A, and it will release the lien. It is 
unclear whether State A would refund the $2,071 that was withheld for state tax 
purposes. Applicant stated that he was waiting until he has the financial ability to pay 
State B before he files the required tax return. He acknowledged that he has an 
independent obligation to file the return even if he does not have the money to pay the 
taxes. In his post-hearing document, he stated that he has requested the IRS to provide 
him with a copy of his 2007 federal tax return, with changes made by the IRS. He stated 
that he plans to file the state return as soon as receives the federal return.10 
 
 Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He stated that he is living 
frugally. He drives an older-model truck with 250,000 miles on it. His wife has a used 
car with 135,000 miles. He has an extreme commute in order to live in a less expensive 
area. He plans on continuing his efforts to pay his tax debt.11 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor verified Applicant’s description of the tax problems 
encountered by the company’s overseas employees. She believes the company failed 
Applicant and other employees who were in similar situations. She described Applicant 
as her top performer, extremely responsible, dedicated, and dependable.12 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

9 The tax debt to State B was not alleged in the SOR, and the tax lien by State A is no longer alleged in 
the SOR. Any financial issues that were not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification 
purposes. They may be considered in assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application 
of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the “whole person.”

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
6 
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a large tax debt covering a number of tax years. The evidence is 
sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant worked in foreign countries from about 1994 to 2006. His tax situation 
was complicated, and it was exacerbated by frequent moves and his company’s 
switching accounting firms. I accept that Applicant relied on his company for assistance, 
and the company may have failed him in some regard. However, the responsibility to file 
his tax returns and pay his taxes ultimately rests on Applicant. AG ¶ 20(b) is not 
applicable.  
 
 Applicant’s tax liability for tax years 2000 through 2005 was in excess of 
$150,000, yet he had only $769 withheld from his pay for those tax years. He made no 
additional payments for those tax years until the IRS began levying his pay in 2008. He 
has been paying the IRS through an installment agreement since January 2009. His tax 
refunds have also been seized by the IRS and applied to his tax debt. Applicant’s 
delinquent taxes for tax years 2000 through 2002 have been paid. As of May 2013, he 
owed about $109,000 for tax years 2003 through 2007. In addition to his federal tax 
debt, Applicant has unresolved state tax problems. He owes State B more than 
$10,000, and he still has not filed a state tax return. 
 
 
7 
 
 Applicant is living frugally, and he has made strides in paying his tax debt. 
However, I am unable to find that his financial problems are under control when he still 
has not filed his 2007 state income tax return. I do not find that he acted responsibly 
under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to resolve all his financial 
problems. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine that 
they are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG ¶ 
20(c) is applicable to the 2000 to 2002 taxes. It is not applicable to the other tax years. I 
find that financial concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 I considered Applicant’s honorable military service, his favorable character 
evidence, and his long and stable work history. However, he has significant unresolved 
tax problems. If he files his state tax return, makes payment arrangements with the 
state, and continues his current course of addressing his federal taxes, he should arrive 
at a position of financial stability consistent with the holding of a security clearance. 
However, he is not there yet. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   Withdrawn 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.e:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.j:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
