GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 18, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On November 27, 2012, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
January 26, 2013.2 On April 17, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on April 24, 2013. In a sworn undated statement, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on July 22, 2013. The 
case was assigned to me on August 9, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
September 11, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 24, 
2013. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 11, 2013. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted five additional documents, which were marked as exhibits 
(AE J through AE N) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
October 22, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with an explanation, three of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d.). He 
denied the remaining allegation. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since February 
2011, has served as a C-130 simulator technician.3 He was previously employed as a 
security officer and truck driver.4 He was granted a security clearance in 1985,5 but it 
was terminated in 2008 because he was in arrears in child support.6 Applicant received 
an Associate’s degree in electronics in May 1980; a Bachelor of Science degree in 
electronics technology in May 1983;7 and a commercial pilot’s license in August 2004 or 
2005.8 Applicant was married in November 1984, and divorced in September 1991; and

married in September 1993, and divorced in January 1998.9 Applicant and his first two 
wives did not have any children together.10 He married his current wife in March 2005.11 
He and his current wife have one daughter, born in July 2000.12 Applicant also has a 
son from another relationship, born in May 1993.13 
 
Military Service 
 
Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Army Reserve from 
September 1981 until April 1985;14 and with the U.S. Air Force from April 1985 until 
October 1993.15 It appears that Applicant also served with either the U.S. Air Force 
Reserve or the U.S. Air Force from October 1993 until February 2010.16 He was 
deployed to Guam from August 1990 until October 1993 in support of Operations Desert 
Shield and Desert Storm.17  
 
During the first four years of his military service, Applicant was awarded the Air 
Force Basic Military Training Ribbon, the Air Force Non-Commissioned Officer 
Professional Military Education Ribbon (with one device), the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Air Force Overseas Service Ribbon - Long Tour, the Air Force Longevity 
Service Award (with one device), the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (with one 
device), and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal (with one oak leaf cluster).18  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 1994 or 1995. 
After discovering that his former girlfriend was pregnant, and a DNA test he requested 
was granted three years later, which proved to be positive, Applicant was ordered to 
pay the child’s mother $334 per month until the child reached the age of 18. The order 
stipulated that the child support would commence with the child’s birth, and Applicant

found himself immediately in arrears.19 In addition to the monthly child support, at some 
unspecified point, Applicant was required to pay an additional $67 per month for 
arrearage.20 In November 2003, Applicant and his ex-girlfriend discussed the financial 
hardship he would encounter if he had to continue paying her child support while 
attending flying school full-time. She agreed that he could stop paying the child support 
while he did so.21 Unfortunately for Applicant, the state in which the mother and child 
were residing was not as empathetic, and his child support arrearage increased even 
further. After graduation, Applicant secured a position as a pilot, but he was prevented 
from working because he was unable to secure a required passport because of his child 
support arrearage.22 
Applicant was unemployed from November 2004 until August 2005.23 In August 
2005, Applicant’s residence was partially destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. When the 
insurance company refused to cover the damage, Applicant was forced to pay for the 
repairs himself. With no incoming salary, the situation caused a financial burden and 
strain on his ability to continue making child support payments.24 In November 2010, 
Applicant was notified that he owed the state $17,087.63, including $16,799.63 in 
arrears and $288 in fees.25 In January 2011, at the child’s mother’s request, Applicant’s 
son moved in with Applicant, and was enrolled in a local school for his senior year.26 
Applicant continued to make frequent, not necessarily monthly, payments, generally in 
the amount of $401 or $334, over a multi-year period.27 On two occasions, his income 
tax refunds were also applied to his unpaid child support balance.28 As of May 7, 2013, 
Applicant’s unpaid balance was down to $2,035.75.29 In September 2013, Applicant 
paid off the remaining balance, and there is no longer any child support arrearage.30 
SOR ¶ 1.d. has been resolved.

As a result of his pursuit of a commercial pilot’s license, Applicant incurred three 
student loans totaling more than $100,000.31 Six months after graduating from flight 
school, Applicant started making monthly $200 payments to each of his student loans.32 
Those payments continued until he lost his job due to the hurricane, when they were 
reduced.33 In June 2009, he lost another job when he was involved in a vehicle 
accident.34 In about September 2009, the three accounts were placed for collection, and 
by January 2011, they were charged off.35 According to a March 2011 credit report, one 
account had a high credit of $13,472, and it was past due $12,738; another had a high 
credit of $81,766, and it was past due $80,413; and the third had a high credit of 
$26,647, and it was past due $25,794.36 However, commencing in about November 
2010, Applicant made monthly payments to the collection agent of the lender bank in 
the amount of $150 per month.37 By December 2010, the total amount owed for the 
combined student loans was $119,216.50, including interest.38 In October 2011, 
Applicant increased his monthly payments to $200.39 By February 2012, the total 
amount owed for the combined student loans was $117,175.36, including $525.73 in 
interest.40  
 
In March 2012, the accounts were returned to the lender bank, and Applicant 
was entered into the bank’s recovery payment processing program.41 The program 
required Applicant to commence making monthly $100 payments for each of the three 
loans, and Applicant has done so.42 Applicant also explored other payment options. In 
May 2013, Applicant engaged the professional services of a company to assist him with 
a government-sponsored debt consolidation and refinance plan to resolve his student 
loan problems and start repaying his debts through a structured repayment plan.43

Under that program, he made various monthly payments totaling $1,899. The first 
payment was made in May 2013 and the last ones were made in September 2013.44 
Unfortunately for Applicant, he was unable to obtain documentation from the company 
that any efforts were made by them to either consolidate the student loans or reduce 
their balances, and the company has refused to respond to telephone calls. As a result, 
Applicant cancelled the program and requested a refund.45 
Applicant and the lender bank also discussed an alternative repayment plan, and 
on October 1, 2013, Applicant secured a short-term $5,000 loan to settle the smallest of 
his three outstanding student loans. He also agreed to increase his monthly payments 
pertaining to the remaining student loans.46 He settled the smallest student loan, made 
his first $501 payment on the largest loan (which, as of October 8, 2013, had a balance 
of $92,198.35), and made his first $500 payment on the middle loan (which, as of 
October 8, 2013, had a balance of $27,752.50).47 SOR ¶ 1.a. has been resolved, and 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c. are in the process of being resolved. 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, in January 2013, Applicant provided a 
personal financial statement reflecting a monthly net family salary of $6,484.05; monthly 
household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $3,229.60; and monthly debt 
repayments of $1,055.50; leaving a monthly remainder of $2,198.95 available for 
discretionary savings or expenditures.48 During the hearing, Applicant generally 
confirmed those figures, noting that the child support payments were now eliminated.49  
There is no evidence that Applicant has any other delinquent accounts. Applicant 
has not received any financial counseling in the last five years.50 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Two of Applicant’s colleagues have known him since he joined his current 
employer and they regard him as a responsible, and trustworthy team player.51 A 
university classmate who has known Applicant for over 30 years, considers Applicant to 
have great character and moral fiber, and believes Applicant has shown himself to be 
trustworthy.52 Two other friends have been close to Applicant since they all played high

of them, a retired Chief Petty Officer. Both friends characterized Applicant as reliable, 
trustworthy, extremely task-oriented, loyal, dedicated to duty, and a man of integrity.53  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”54 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”55   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”56 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.57  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”58 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”59 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 1994 or 1995, Applicant started experiencing some 
financial difficulties, especially when confronted with an unexpected child support 
arrearage. Over the next few years, those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His student 
loan accounts eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.60  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 1994 or 1995 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely 
beyond his control. His former girlfriend gave birth to Applicant’s son, but he was not 
proven to be the boy’s biological father until several years later when a DNA analysis 
proved to be positive. Applicant was assessed child support arrearage commencing 
with the child’s birth. Applicant was unemployed from November 2004 until August 
2005. In August 2005, Applicant’s residence was partially destroyed by Hurricane

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Katrina, and the insurance company refused to cover the damage. With no incoming 
salary, the situation caused a financial burden and strain on his ability to continue 
making child support payments. After his graduation from flight school, Applicant was 
prevented from working as a pilot because he was unable to secure a required passport 
because of his child support arrearage. Instead, he accepted lower-paying positions.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent child support and 
student loan accounts. He continued making payments as long as he could do so. He 
worked out repayment plans with his creditors, and engaged the professional services 
of a company to assist him with a government-sponsored debt consolidation and 
refinance plan to resolve his student loan problems and start repaying his debts through 
a structured repayment plan. That effort seemingly was unsuccessful as the company 
remains unresponsive although it has been paid by Applicant for its services. 
Nevertheless, despite that setback, in September 2013, Applicant finally paid off the 
remaining balance of his child support arrearage. Applicant and the lender bank of his 
student loans settled the smallest of three student loans when Applicant paid the lender 
$5,000. He also agreed to increase his monthly payments pertaining to the remaining 
student loans, and made his first $1,001 monthly payment on the two remaining student 
loans. He has no other delinquent debts. With a monthly remainder of $2,198.95 
available for discretionary savings or expenditures, there are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.61 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various

aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.62       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted three student loan accounts to become delinquent. His handling 
of his personal affairs resulted in a paternity action by the state which established a child 
support responsibility. As a result, the student loan accounts were placed for collection, 
and the child support account was determined to be in arrears. In addition, Applicant 
seemingly placed his personal ambition to become a commercial pilot ahead of his 
financial responsibilities as a father. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control.  Applicant was unexpectedly assessed child support and a child 
support arrearage; he was unemployed from November 2004 until August 2005; his 
residence was partially destroyed by Hurricane Katrina; the insurance company refused 
to cover the damage; and Applicant was prevented from working as a pilot because he 
was unable to secure a required passport because of his child support arrearage. All of 
the above created a financial burden and strain on his ability to continue making child 
support payments. Nevertheless, Applicant did not ignore his creditors. Instead, he 
embraced his financial responsibilities and accepted lower-paying positions in an effort 
to address his creditors. The entire situation occurred under such circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:63 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts

simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
