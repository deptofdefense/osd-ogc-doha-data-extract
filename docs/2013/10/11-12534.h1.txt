Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. Her recent history of security
infractions or violations coupled with a history of financial problems equate to a pattern
of irresponsible, lax, or negligent conduct. She did not present sufficient evidence to
explain, extenuate, and mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, this case is decided
against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On April 12, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a statement
of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

national interest to grant or continue access to classified information.  The SOR is1
similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the security
guidelines known as Guideline K for handling protected information, Guideline M for
misuse of information technology systems, Guideline E for personal conduct, and
Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was
assigned to me on July 3, 2013. The hearing took place by video teleconference as
scheduled on August 7, 2013. The transcript was received on August 15, 2013.   
The record was kept open until August 20, 2013, to allow Applicant to submit
documentary matters. Those matters were timely received and they are admitted
without objections as Exhibits A and B. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor, and she is seeking to
retain a security clearance. With a background in software engineering, she has worked
for the same company, a major defense contractor, since mid-2000. She worked as a
software engineer programmer for several years before moving into the field of
software-configuration management. Her educational background includes a bachelor’s
degree in computer engineer technology and a master’s degree in technology
management.  
Married in 2003, Applicant and her husband had twin sons in 2006. Her
husband’s residential landscaping business failed in about 2010. He now works as an
administrator at the church they attend. His annual income, which includes military
retired pay, is about $30,000 to $35,000. She earns an annual salary of about $78,000.
They have no other sources of income. She stated that she has a 401(k) account with a
balance of about $136,000 (with a loan against the account), an IRA account with about
$6,000, no savings account, and a checking account with a minimal balance as of the
day of the hearing.  
There is substantial evidence establishing that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties.  The five delinquent accounts in the SOR fall into two2
 The three collection accounts (for $106, $180, and $32) are so minor that, when viewed individually or in3
combination with the evidence as a whole, they do not raise a security concern. Accordingly, those matters
will not be discussed further.

categories: (1) three collection accounts totaling $318; and (2) two delinquent loans
stemming from a home that was foreclosed upon.  3
The foreclosure on Applicant’s home occurred in late 2011. She reported the
incident to her company’s security office in May 2012 as follows:
In November 2011 my husband and I had a foreclosure on our home,
[street address]. For at least two years, my husband and I attempted to
work with [a large national bank] to do a loan modification. We were
$150,000 in the rear on our [loan], and we could not keep up with the
payments along with child care and other housing expenses. After several
efforts to do a modification, we attempted a short sale, but once again we
were denied. After much thought, we decided to walk away from [the]
house, we couldn’t get any form of credit not even store credit. Since then
we have moved into a rental home, we are slowly getting back up on our
financial feet.4
The two loans associated with the home were both obtained or opened in April
2006.  The mortgage loan had a high credit of $272,469, and the home equity line of5
credit (HELOC) had a high credit of $68,118. A July 2011 credit report shows that both
loans were late over 120 days; the mortgage loan was $11,417 past due; and the
HELOC was $8,690 past due. Both loans continued to deteriorate. A December 2012
credit report  shows that the mortgage loan was a foreclosure with a $0 balance, and6
the HELOC was a charged-off account  with a balance of $72,922. And a June 20137
credit report  shows the same information for both loans. 8
Applicant has had no communication with the lender since walking away from the
property. She was unaware of the status of either loan and presented no documentary
information on either. She made no effort to resolve the HELOC, choosing instead to
address medical bills and current debts.  Whether she is still liable or responsible for the9
 It’s possible that a Form 1099-C would not be issued for a mortgage loan default due to The Mortgage10
Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. In general, the Act provides tax relief for cancelled or forgiven mortgage
debt, between 2007 and 2012, that was used to buy, build, or substantially improve a principal residence, or
to refinance debt incurred for those purposes, and the debt must have been secured by the home. W hether
the Act applies to Applicant’s situation is a question beyond the scope of this proceeding, and it is not decided
herein.

either loan is a difficult question and is governed by state law. The only way to know for
certain that a debt has been forgiven is if a debtor is issued a Form 1099-C,
Cancellation of Debt,  or receives a letter or other document from a creditor stating that10
the account has been resolved in their favor. There is no documentary information
showing that either has occurred here. 
In addition to her financial difficulties, there is substantial evidence establishing
Applicant has a history of security infractions or violations while working for her current
employer.  There are five incidents that occurred between 2009–2012 that form the11
basis for the SOR allegations under Guideline K. Most recent, she was found culpable
for three security incidents during a 12-month period as follows: (1) in January 2012,
she inadvertently placed a classified document in the wrong container and received a
written warning; (2) in early December 2012, she was found responsible for sending a
password for a classified server via unclassified means; and (3) in later December
2012, she was found culpable for leaving a security container unsecured. As a result of
the two December incidents, she received a written reprimand and was suspended from
work for five days without pay.  None of the five incidents resulted in the actual or12
probable compromise of classified information. Applicant admits the incidents were
careless mistakes that she regrets.  Since returning from the five-day suspension, she13
received additional security training and she was moved to another program where she
does not work with classified information.  14
Applicant presented character evidence in the form of two letters of
recommendation from coworkers who were also former managers or supervisors.  Both15
letters are highly favorable.

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As16
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt17
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An18
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  19
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting20
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An21
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate22
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme23
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.24
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.25
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it26
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
In analyzing this case, I considered the evidence as a whole under Guideline F
for financial considerations  and Guideline K for handling protected information.  That27 28
evidence shows a history of financial problems coupled with a history of security
infractions or violations. Taken together, those facts and circumstances equate to a
pattern of irresponsible, lax, or negligent conduct.  Such a pattern is wholly inconsistent29
with being a suitable candidate for a security clearance. Although I am persuaded that
Applicant is a good, decent, and hard-working person, the financial problems and the
recent series of lapses in her security responsibilities undermine her security suitability.
I reviewed and considered the mitigating conditions under the guidelines in light
of the evidence, and none, individually or in combination, is sufficient to explain,
extenuate, and mitigate the security concerns. In particular, she did not meet her “very
heavy burden” to demonstrate mitigation in a case involving security violations under
Guideline K.  Applicant did not present sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation30
to demonstrate that her history of financial problems and security violations are safely in
the past. In addition, the SOR allegations under Guideline E for personal conduct and
Guideline M for information technology, which consist of cross-allegations to matters
under Guideline K, are decided against Applicant under the same rationale. 
In deciding this case, I have weighed and evaluated the evidence in light of the
whole-person concept.  In doing so, I gave Applicant credit for her favorable character31
evidence, but it is not sufficient to justify a favorable decision for Applicant.

Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline K: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline M: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: Against Applicant
Paragraph 3, Guideline E: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 3.a: Against Applicant
Paragraph 4, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 4.a & 4.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 4.b, 4.d, & 4.e: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
