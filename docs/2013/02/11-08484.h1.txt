GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 16, 2010, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85).1 On March 8, 2011, Applicant 
applied for a security clearance and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).2 
On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on August 7, 2012.3 On an 
unspecified date, the DOD issued him another set of interrogatories. He responded to

those interrogatories on August 7, 2012.4 On September 7, 2012, the DOD issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators 
were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on November 2, 2012. In a sworn statement, dated 
November 15, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. On December 13, 2012, Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on 
January 4, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 25, 2013, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on February 14, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, eight Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 8) and five 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE E) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 25, 2013. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity, and he submitted additional documents which were grouped and marked 
as exhibits (AE F through AE L) that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three (¶¶ 1.c., 1.f., and 1.g.) of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since February 
2010, has served as a procurement specialist. He was previously employed by other 
employers in various positions, including mortgage company vice president, escrow and 
title company vice president, mortgage company loan processor, and mortgage 
company loan originator.5 He has no military service.6 It is unclear if Applicant was ever

granted a security clearance, although he believes he was granted a “general 
clearance” to allow him access to the facility where he works.7 Applicant received a 
bachelor’s degree in psychology in June 1990.8 He has never been married, and he has 
no children. 
 
Financial Considerations 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2007. In the years prior to that point, Applicant had worked in the real estate and 
mortgage industry in the region for about 20 years, deriving a stable annual income, 
based on commissions, bonuses, and transaction fees, of between $65,000 and 
$70,000.9 He lived a modest, but comfortable, lifestyle, and was able to invest in real 
estate. All of his accounts were current.10 However, commencing in 2007, and 
continuing over the next few years, several events occurred that caused him financial 
problems that made it difficult for him to remain current on all of his accounts. First, the 
national, and especially the local, real estate markets deteriorated dramatically as the 
economy collapsed. His annual income plummeted to $25,000 to $30,000, and 
remained there until 2010.11 In addition, Applicant’s mother was diagnosed with a 
medical malady for which treatment was expensive, and which, until her death, created 
a financial burden on him.12 As a result of the reduced income and increased medical 
expenses, Applicant exhausted his savings to meet monthly living expenses and debt.13 
Nevertheless, accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or 
charged off.  
He sought guidance from a financial attorney who advised Applicant to seek 
protection under bankruptcy. But Applicant chose not to avoid his creditors because he 
felt obligated to work out repayment of his debts.14 He spoke with, and reviewed, 
several debt reduction advisors and programs, and selected one program, which he has 
followed. He contacted the creditors and collection agents regarding his delinquent 
accounts, and tried to work out repayment arrangements.15 He also set up a budget and 
a repayment schedule reflecting anticipated steps in his repayment plan. His plan 
prioritizes accounts, from smallest to highest balances. Initially, he was only able to

make a monthly $50 payment to one creditor, but as he satisfied one creditor, the 
anticipated payments rolled over to other identified debts, and he was able to increase 
his monthly payments to $300.16 Applicant took full responsibility for his remaining 
debts, and he intends to pay them off one bill at a time. He has been paying off various 
smaller accounts, as well as other accounts that are apparently not listed in the SOR, 
with the intention of eventually addressing the remaining larger accounts.17 He also 
obtained part-time employment to supplement his income.18 
During his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) in March 2011, Applicant provided a personal financial statement 
reflecting a monthly net salary of $3,256.89; monthly household, utility, transportation, 
and food expenses of $1,693.64; and monthly debt repayments of $1,475.81; leaving a 
monthly remainder of $87.44, available for discretionary spending or savings.19 
Applicant’s 2013 budget reflects a monthly net income of $3,068; and monthly debt 
payments of $300.20 He has a combined $700 in his checking and saving accounts; and 
a combined $54,000 in his retirement accounts.21 Other than two debts, described 
further below, Applicant has no other financial delinquencies, as he had resolved all the 
other delinquent accounts by the end of 2012.22 
The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing delinquencies. Those accounts 
can be divided into two separate categories: those already paid off or otherwise 
resolved, and those for which attempts to do so have been difficult or unsuccessful for 
reasons beyond his control. 
  
In the first category, there is a cable account that had an unpaid balance of $449 
that was placed for collection (SOR & 1.a.).23 Applicant acknowledged having the cable 
service, but contended that when the service was discontinued, the technician removed 
the cable equipment, but failed to issue Applicant a receipt.24 The amount sought was 
for the cost of the missing equipment. Nevertheless, the account was paid in full before 
the SOR was issued,25 and the creditor subsequently confirmed that the account was 
satisfied.26

There is also a bank credit card account in the amount of $8,069 that was placed 
for collection and charged off (SOR & 1.b.).27 On May 15, 2012, Applicant and the 
plaintiff-creditor agreed that the account would be settled and resolved by a lump sum 
payment in the amount of $4,100.28 The payment was made, and the case against 
Applicant was dismissed with prejudice on June 15, 2012, months before the SOR was 
issued.29  
 
There is a bank credit card account in the amount of $2,591.76 that was placed 
for collection and charged off (SOR & 1.d.).30 The unpaid balance was increased to 
$2,941.76.31 On May 14, 2012, Applicant and the plaintiff-creditor agreed that the 
account would be settled and resolved by three payments in the total amount of 
$2,150.32 The payment was made, and the case against Applicant was dismissed on 
May 31, 2012, months before the SOR was issued.33  
 
There is a bank credit card account in the amount of $4,709 that was placed for 
collection, charged off, and sold to a debt purchaser (SOR & 1.e.).34 On some 
unspecified date, Applicant and the debt purchaser agreed to an unspecified repayment 
plan, and by August 7, 2012, one month before the SOR was issued, Applicant made 
his final payment on the account, and the matter was deemed resolved.35 The payment 
was made, and the case against Applicant was dismissed on May 31, 2012, months 
before the SOR was issued.36  
 
There is a home mortgage loan in the amount of $345,000 on Applicant’s former 
primary residence, on which he managed to make timely monthly payments to reduce

the unpaid balance to about $288,000 (SOR & 1.g.).37 Because of the difficulty in 
continuing to make timely payments due to his reduced income, Applicant initiated the 
mortgage modification process. He made his agreed payments and put the house on 
the market. Nothing happened for three years, except the real estate market in the area 
continued to plummet. In June 2012, despite the new unpaid balance on the account 
being $319,397.32, the mortgage holder accepted a short sale offer in the amount of 
$159,000.38 The property was sold on June 27, 2012.39 The mortgage was released in 
July 2012, and the account was resolved with the mortgage holder expressing “full 
payment and satisfaction.”40 Since the mortgage was cancelled and discharged by the 
release, contrary to the SOR allegation, there is no deficiency balance.41 
 
In the second category, there is a home equity account or unsecured line of 
credit with an unpaid balance of $27,630 that was placed for collection and charged off 
(SOR & 1.c.).42 Applicant has repeatedly called the creditor in an effort to establish a 
repayment plan, but the bank is unable to locate his account records. He was advised 
not to make any payments until those records could be located.43 Applicant has 
furnished the bank with his contact information, and he is hoping to resolve the account 
as soon as possible. 
 
There is an account with a national retail home improvement store with an unpaid 
balance of $2,532 that was placed for collection, charged off, and sold to a debt 
purchaser (SOR & 1.f.).44 Although the account is listed in the various credit reports as 
an individual account in Applicant’s name, he contends that he was merely an 
authorized user of the account of his former business partner.45 The collection agent 
informed Applicant that since he is not a joint owner on the account, and there is no 
power of attorney from the account owner, they would not share account information 
with Applicant.46 The account owner is incapacitated by a stroke.47 Applicant would pay

family of the account owner and the current debt holder.49   
 
Work Performance  
 
 Applicant’s work performance has been described by two senior company 
managers in extremely positive terms. He has been described as reliable, dedicated, 
eternally upbeat, extremely courteous, exceptionally professional, adept, and honest.50 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”51 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”52   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”53 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.54  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”55 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”56 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2007, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties, and over the next few years those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.57  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies, and AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing and escalating financial 
difficulties since 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

so infrequent.” Although he had extensive experience in finance as a mortgage 
company vice president, escrow and title company vice president, mortgage company 
loan processor, and mortgage company loan originator, Applicant consulted with both a 
financial attorney and a debt reduction advisor. With the guidance received from the 
debt reduction advisor, Applicant prioritized his accounts and contacted his creditors 
and collection agents. While he was unable to commence making payments 
simultaneously on all of the accounts, Applicant did enter into repayment plans with 
nearly all of his creditors. The result has been positive. Applicant has resolved all but 
two of the accounts, including five of the seven that are in the SOR and all that are not. 
If the two remaining creditors or collection agents referred to in the SOR would 
cooperate with him, Applicant is prepared to resolve those two accounts as well. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.58 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies. For about 20 years prior to 2007, Applicant had worked in 
the real estate and mortgage industry in the region, deriving a stable annual income, 
based on commissions, bonuses, and transaction fees, of between $65,000 and 
$70,000. However, commencing in 2007, and continuing over the next few years, 
several events occurred that caused him financial problems that made it difficult for him 
to remain current on all of his accounts. First, the national, and especially the local, real 
estate markets deteriorated dramatically as the economy collapsed. His annual income 
plummeted to $25,000 to $30,000, and remained there until 2010. In addition, the 
expenses associated with his mother’s medical malady and death, created an additional 
financial burden on him. As a result of the reduced income and increased medical 
expenses, Applicant exhausted his savings to meet monthly living expenses and debt. 
Accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. 
Applicant’s indebtedness was not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he 
did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely beyond 
his control. Under the circumstances, Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his 
delinquent accounts rather than avoiding them.59  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.60       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant sought the assistance of both a financial attorney and a debt reduction 
advisor. With the guidance received from the debt reduction advisor, Applicant 
prioritized his accounts and contacted his creditors and collection agents. While he was 
unable to commence making payments simultaneously on all of the accounts, Applicant 
did enter into repayment plans with nearly all of his creditors. The result has been 
positive. Applicant has resolved all but two of the accounts, including five of the seven 
that are in the SOR and all that are not. If the two remaining creditors or collection 
agents referred to in the SOR would cooperate with him, Applicant is prepared to 
resolve those two accounts as well. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. He possesses an excellent reputation in the workplace. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:61 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of

an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue his debt resolution 
efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for 
a security clearance. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant   
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
