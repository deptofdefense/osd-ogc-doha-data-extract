FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 12, 2010. On 
July 5, 2012, the Defense of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), 
alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on July 15, 2012; answered it on July 25, 2012; and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed on November 29, 2012, and the case was assigned to me on December 4, 
2012. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
on December 19, 2012, scheduling it for January 15, 2013. I convened the hearing as 
 
2 
 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Department Counsel’s exhibit list and a demonstrative exhibit summarizing 
his evidence were attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II. Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without 
objection. I kept the record open until February 1, 2013, to enable both parties to submit 
additional documentary evidence. Department Counsel timely submitted GX 8, 9, and 
10, and Applicant timely submitted AX C. All post-hearing submissions were admitted 
without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding GX 8, GX 9, GX 10, and 
AX C are attached to the record as HX III and IV. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
January 23, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 
1.e, 1.f, 1.i,1 1.l, and 1.m. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p. His 
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 43-year-old aircraft sheet metal mechanic employed by a defense 
contractor since July 2008. He received a clearance from another government agency 
in May 2000 and a favorable trustworthiness determination from DOD in March 2008. 
(GX 1 at 85; GX 2 at 6.) 
 
 Applicant married in February 1994 and divorced in February 2001. He married 
his current spouse in May 2003. He has two children, ages 17 and 19, from his first 
marriage and two stepchildren, ages 18 and 22. 
 
 Applicant began working in the aviation maintenance field in 1993. He was hired 
by a major airline in January 1998. He was transferred to a new location and bought a 
home around October 2001. After about a year, he was laid off. He was unemployed 
from November 2002 to September 2003. (Tr. 36; GX 1 at 56.) In October 2003, he 
started working world-wide for various contractors. (Tr. 32-33.)  
 
 Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in August 2006. He testified that 
he was between contracting jobs, fell behind on his obligations, and needed help to 
organize and resolve his debts. (Tr. 37.) His SCA does not reflect any periods of 
unemployment in 2006. However, it does reflect several “on call” jobs and employment 
by more than one employer at the same time. He testified that he made all the required 
payments to the trustee until the bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2008. He 
testified that he began working overseas in November 2008, making more money, and 
was able to start paying his debts himself. (Tr. 37-38; GX 3 at 181.2) However, his belief 
that all debts in this bankruptcy were resolved is undercut by the fact that the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.p, which predated the bankruptcy, is still unresolved. 
                                                          
1 He admitted this debt, but he mislabeled it as SOR ¶ 1.j in his answer. 
 
2 The pagination of GX 3 begins with page 171.

Applicant worked in Iraq in 2007 and 2008 and in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. 
(AX C.) He received a certificate of appreciation for his Afghanistan service from April 
2009 to February 2010. (Attachment to Answer to SOR.) In June 2010, he began 
working as a field engineer, holding an interim clearance and earning about $167,000 
per year. In July 2011, his interim clearance was revoked, and he was demoted, 
reducing his pay to about $60,000. (Tr. Tr. 35-36.) 
 
 Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on December 31, 2012. 
He and his wife have completed the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy 
court. The confirmation hearing is scheduled for March 25, 2013. (AX A; AX B; GX 8.) 
 
Applicant’s wife was unemployed from January 2009 to November 2012. Her 
monthly take-home pay is now about $2,800. Applicant’s monthly take-home pay is 
about $4,800. (Tr. 53-54.) His family is living in a rental home in another state and 
paying rent of $2,100. He is renting lodging at his current job site for $500 per month. 
(Tr. 54-56.) In his May 10, 2012 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted 
a personal financial statement (PFS) reflecting net monthly income of $5,528, expenses 
of $2,310, debt payments of $3,774, and net remainder of $1,754. (GX 3 at 187.) In his 
December 2012 bankruptcy petition, he reported net monthly income of about $4,184, 
expenses (including debt payments) of $2,834, and a remainder of about $1,350. (GX 
10 at 18.) The bankruptcy plan provides for bi-weekly payments of $311.54. (AX A.) 
 
 Applicant denied the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c because he 
believes that his medical insurance should have covered them. (Tr. 39-40.) These two 
debts are included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (GX 10 at 13.) 
 
 Applicant admitted the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f, and testified that 
they had been paid. He was unable to produce documents showing that they were paid. 
(Tr. 41-42; AX C.) These debts do not appear to be included in his bankruptcy petition. 
Although numerous collection agencies are listed in the bankruptcy petition, Applicant 
could not connect them to the debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
 Applicant denied the four state tax liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. 
He testified that he believed the liens were for income taxes in a state where he no 
longer lives. He contacted the state but has not taken any action to have them removed 
from his credit record. They are still reflected on his credit bureau report (CBR) dated 
January 14, 2013. (GX 7 at 2.) They are not listed in his bankruptcy petition. 
 
 The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is for delinquent payments on a home mortgage. It 
is included in the bankruptcy. (GX 10 at 8.) Applicant testified he moved out of this 
home in February 2009 and has been trying to rent it out, with limited success. (Tr. 55.) 
 
 The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l was a debt to a homeowners’ association that was 
reduced to judgment. Applicant admitted this debt and testified that the judgment was 
satisfied, but he was unable to provide documentation of payment. (Tr. 47-48.) He 
testified that the judgment was included in his bankruptcy. The homeowners’ 
 
4 
 
association is not listed in his bankruptcy petition, but a collection attorney seeking 
about the same amount of money is listed. (GX 10 at 13.) 
 
 Applicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m, but claimed that he had paid 
it. (Tr. 49-50.) He was unable to submit documentation of payment. 
 
 Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n. He has not contacted the 
creditor or challenged the debt with the credit bureaus. (Tr. 50.) 
 
 Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o. He testified that he does not 
know why it is listed on his credit report, but he has not contacted the creditor or 
challenged the debt with the credit bureaus. (Tr. 50.) 
 
 Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p, which is a deficiency after a 
voluntary car repossession. He testified that he thought the debt was included and paid 
in his 2006 bankruptcy, but he found out later that a balance was still due. He testified 
that the debt is included in his 2012 bankruptcy. However, the creditor is not listed in the 
petition and there are no collection attorneys or agencies with claims for the amount 
alleged. (Tr. 51; GX 10.) 
 
 Applicant testified that he has disputed entries on his credit reports in the past. 
However, he has not disputed many of the entries on his current CBRs because the 
current on-line process is too complicated and too time consuming. (Tr. 63-64.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
 
5 
 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in August 
2006, which was dismissed in November 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also alleges 15 
delinquent debts totaling about $38,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.p). 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
 
6 
 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence presented by Department 
Counsel are sufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions under this 
guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
7 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
ongoing, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. Applicant encountered conditions beyond his 
control: his divorce in February 2002, his unemployment from November 2002 to 
September 2003, his wife’s unemployment from January 2009 to November 2012, and 
his demotion and substantial pay reduction in July 2011. However, he has not acted 
responsibly. He filed a bankruptcy petition in August 2006 after almost three years of 
steady employment. His only explanation for this bankruptcy was that he was falling 
behind on his bills and was between contracts. His current financial predicament was 
triggered when he lost his interim clearance and was demoted in July 2011. However, 
he demonstrated at the hearing that he does not have a good grasp of his financial 
situation. He has no documentation for the bills he claims to have paid, and he has not 
bothered to file disputes of bills that he thinks are questionable because he considers 
the process too complicated and time consuming. I conclude that this mitigating 
condition is not fully established. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) also is partially established. Applicant has received financial 
counseling in connection with both of his bankruptcy petitions, but his financial situation 
is not yet under control. His most recent bankruptcy petition was filed only recently, his 
payment plan has not been confirmed, and insufficient time has passed for him to 
establish a track record of compliance with the payment plan. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). “[A]n applicant must do 
more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of this [mitigating condition.’”] ISCR Case No. 
03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). While Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a legally 
permissible, and sometimes prudent, means of resolving debts, I must consider the 
facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to 
satisfy his debts in order to determine his suitability for a security clearance. See ISCR 
Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). He claimed to have resolved several 
debts, but he was unable to provide documentation to support his claims. He apparently 
filed his bankruptcy petition as a substitute for evaluating his situation and devising a 
plan to resolve his debts. His bankruptcy plan is not yet confirmed. At the hearing, he 
was unable to show that all his debts are included in the plan. His financial track record 
does not inspire confidence that he will comply with his bankruptcy plan even if it is 
confirmed.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant articulated a plausible basis for disputing 
some of the debts alleged in the SOR, e.g., the state tax liens, but he failed to provide 
documented proof to substantiate the basis for his dispute and he provided no evidence 
of actions to resolve the disputes.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant was candid and sincere at the hearing, but not well prepared. He was 
unable to produce documentation of his financial situation even though he was given 
additional time to do so. Although he intended to include all the debts alleged in the 
SOR in his most recent bankruptcy petition, it is not clear that he has done so. He has 
worked at his trade for many years and served U.S. military forces under combat 
conditions. He is dedicated to his family. However, because of his inadequate efforts to 
resolve his financial situation, he has been unable to carry his burden of refuting, 
explaining, extenuating, or mitigating the security concerns raised by his financial 
problems. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.p:    Against Applicant 
 
9 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
