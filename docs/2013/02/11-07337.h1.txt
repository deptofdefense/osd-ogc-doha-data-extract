FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on March 15, 2011. On 
August 10, 2012, the Defense of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 20, 2012; answered it on September 10, 
2012; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on November 29, 2012, and the case was assigned to me on 
December 4, 2012. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing on December 19, 2012, scheduling it for January 15, 2013. I convened 
 
2 
 
the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Department Counsel also submitted an exhibit list, marked 
as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I, and a demonstrative exhibit summarizing his evidence, 
marked as HX II. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through 
Q, which were admitted without objection. Many of the documents included in AX Q 
were original documents, and I permitted Applicant to substitute copies after the hearing 
adjourned. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 23, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.d. She 
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c and 1.e-1.m. Her admissions in her answer 
and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 43-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor 
since February 2011. She served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard from 
September 1992 to August 1996 and received an honorable discharge. (AX I.) She 
received bachelor’s degrees in information systems and business administration in May 
2003. She was unemployed from June 2003 until late 2003, and she worked part time 
from late 2003 until early 2004, when her job became full time. (GX 2 at 24-25.) She 
was laid off in April 2007 and was unemployed until September 2007. (GX 1 at 18-19.) 
She worked for a non-federal employer from September 2007 until March 2008. She 
worked for another defense contractor from March 2008 until she began her current job. 
She received a security clearance in November 1992, while in the Coast Guard, and 
she was cleared for a public trust position in another government agency in September 
2010. (GX 1 at 37.)  
 
 Applicant married in February 1995 and divorced in October 1998. She married 
again in March 2003 and divorced in November 2005. She has a 29-year-old son from a 
previous relationship and a 17-year-old daughter from her first marriage. Her daughter, 
a high school senior, lives with her. Applicant does not receive any child support from 
the father of her daughter. (Tr. 48.) 
 
 The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized 
below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (cell phone bill, $1,405). Applicant testified that this debt was 
incurred by her goddaughter, a single mother of an infant child, who had been 
“removed” from her residence. Applicant took her into her home in 2008, and gave her a 
cell phone. Applicant testified that she learned about the delinquent cell phone bill in 
2010 but could not afford to pay it. She was earning about $60,000 per year at that time. 
She did not take any steps to resolve the bill until May 2012, when she settled it for 
$709. (AX A; Tr. 57-58.) She asked her goddaughter to leave her home in 2010. (Tr. 
72.) 
 
 
3 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b (Medical, $130, referred for collection in December 2005). 
Applicant denied owing this debt in her answer to the SOR and in a personal subject 
interview (PSI) in April 2011. (GX 2 at 24.) In her undated and unsworn response to 
DOHA interrogatories that were sent to her in March 2012, and in her testimony at the 
hearing, she stated that she contacted the collection agency, who told her that they had 
no record of this debt. She has not disputed it with the credit bureaus. (Tr. 58-59; GX 2 
at 6.) This debt is unresolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c (State taxes for 2005, $3,015). Applicant testified and presented 
documentary evidence that she timely filed an electronic state tax return, on which she 
had computed a tax debt of $15. (Tr. 59-60; AX B; AX C.) State tax authorities audited 
her return and determined that she owed additional taxes. In May 2006, a tax lien for 
$3,015 was filed against Applicant, representing the additional taxes due plus penalties 
and interest. (GX 6; GX 7). She testified that she was unaware of the additional taxes 
due or the lien until she was questioned about them in April 2011. (Tr. 60.) Her SCA 
reflects that she moved from the address listed in the court records in January 2005, 
before the lien was filed. (GX 1 at 10.) She began making payments on the delinquent 
taxes in May 2012. In November 2012, she entered into a payment plan requiring 
monthly payments of $348.56 for 12 months, with the first payment due on December 
15, 2012. She made payments equal to or greater than the agreed amount through 
January 2013. (AX D; AX E.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d (Failure to file state tax return for 2010). Applicant admitted that 
she did not timely file her state tax return for tax year 2010. She testified that she “got 
busy and forgot.” In her response to the SOR, she submitted documentation that she 
filed her return on September 8, 2012. (Attachment D to Answer; Tr. 64.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e (Cell phone bill, $791, referred for collection in December 2010); 
SOR ¶ 1.f (TV cable service, $230, referred for collection in October 2008); and 
SOR ¶ 1.g (TV cable service, $61, referred for collection in January 2011.) In her 
responses to the March 2012 DOHA interrogatories and at the hearing, she stated that 
she disputed these three bills on the ground that they had been paid, and the debts 
were removed from her credit report. (GX 2 at 5; Tr. 65-67.) She did not submit any 
evidence of payments. However, her testimony is corroborated by the fact that these 
debts do not appear on the most recent credit bureau reports (CBRs) submitted by her 
and Department Counsel. (AX F; GX 8.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h (Medical, $277, referred for collection in February 2005). Appellant 
was questioned about this debt in April 2011, and she told the investigator that she 
recognized the debt and agreed with it, but she did not know that it had been referred 
for collection. (GX 2 at 23.) In her response to the SOR, Applicant submitted 
documentary evidence that she paid this debt on November 16, 2011. (Attachment H to 
Answer; Tr. 67-68.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i (Medical, $287, referred for collection in March 2011). Applicant 
testified that she believes this debt duplicates SOR ¶ 1.h, based on the amount. She 
 
4 
 
testified that she had only one delinquent medical bill for this amount. She has not 
disputed this debt with the collection agency. (Tr. 69.) However, her belief that the debt 
has been resolved is corroborated by the fact that the debt is not reflected on the 
January 2013 CBRs submitted by Department Counsel and Applicant. (GX 8; AX F.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, 1.l (Traffic tickets for $200, $100, and $300.). Applicant 
testified that she incurred the $200 ticket in 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.j), but the $100 and $300 
tickets (SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l) were incurred by her goddaughter while she was driving 
Applicant’s car. (Tr. 70-73.) Applicant had received several violation notices in the mail 
and paid them, but she was unaware of the tickets incurred by her goddaughter. She 
testified that the municipal records reflected several other unpaid traffic tickets she had 
received, dating back to 2002. In December 2012, she paid her goddaughter’s tickets, 
her own $200 ticket, and $590 for several other outstanding tickets. (AX G; AX H; Tr. 
71.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m (Repossession deficiency, $9,167, referred for collection in May 
2006). In her PSI, Applicant told the investigator that she bought a truck in 2000 and 
made timely payments until she became unemployed. In 2004, she surrendered the 
truck to the lender, and tried to negotiate a settlement. She told the investigator that she 
and the lender agreed in 2006 to settle the debt for $3,000, but the lender never sent 
her the paperwork to consummate the agreement. (GX 2 at 24.) Her March 2011 CBR 
reflects that the original amount of the debt was $16,099 and the balance due is $9,167. 
(GX 5 at 12.) At the hearing, she testified that she believed the balance due when she 
surrendered the vehicle was around $5,000 or $6,000. (Tr. 75.) Her last contact with the 
lender was around 2008, when the lender insisted on payment of $10,000. The debt is 
unresolved. (Tr. 77-79.) 
 
 In response to the March 2012 DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a 
personal financial statement (PFS). In the block for monthly income, she listed her 
annual income instead of monthly income. She listed gross income of $112,487, annual 
net income of $94,423, and monthly expenses of $2,720. She listed a car payment of 
$374 and five other payments under “monthly debts” that appear to duplicate her listed 
monthly expenses. She did not compute her net remainder. (GX 2 at 9.)  
 
Applicant recently received a pay raise of about $2,000 per year. (Tr. 81.) She 
has no retirement funds. She has between $1,500 and $2,000 in a checking account 
and “maybe a couple hundred dollars” in a savings account. She drives a 2009 
economy car. (Tr. 80.) She testified that her commuting costs are high because she 
drives almost 70 miles between her home and her work place. (Tr. 84.) She has not 
sought or received financial counseling. (GX 2 at 25.) 
 
 In her answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant submitted numerous 
letters from present and former supervisors and colleagues. They uniformly describe 
her as a very talented, hard-working, dedicated, and trustworthy employee. She has a 
reputation for good judgment, effective communication, and strong leadership. She has 
 
5 
 
received numerous awards, certificates, and commendations for her work. (Attachment 
5 to Answer, AX J through Q.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 
6 
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.m) and failure to 
timely file a state income tax return (SOR ¶ 1.d). The concern under this guideline is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admission of SOR ¶ 1.d, her testimony at the hearing, and the 
documentary evidence presented by Department Counsel establish the following 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
AG ¶ 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 
7 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, 
and several are not resolved. With the exception of the delinquent cell phone bill and 
two traffic tickets incurred by Applicant’s goddaughter (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.k, and 1.l), they 
did not arise under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  
 
 The first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) is established, because Applicant encountered 
several conditions beyond her control. She was unemployed for several months after 
graduating from college in 2003, and after being laid off from April 2007 until September 
2007. She went through marital breakups in October 1998 and November 2005, and 
has raised two children with no financial support from their fathers. The cell phone bill 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the traffic tickets alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l were the result 
of her goddaughter’s irresponsible conduct. However, the second prong of AG ¶ 20(b) 
(responsible conduct) is not established. She learned about the cell phone bill in 2010 
but did not resolve it until May 2012, after she was questioned about it during her PSI in 
April 2011 and in DOHA interrogatories in March 2012. She learned about the unpaid 
state taxes in April 2011, but she did not begin to pay them until May 2012. She failed to 
timely file her state income tax return for 2010 because she forgot about it. She did not 
file her overdue income tax return until September 2012, after she received the SOR. 
She did not resolve a medical debt referred for collection in February 2005 until 
November 2011. She did not resolve her own traffic tickets dating back to 2002 until 
December 2012, a month before the hearing. She has done nothing to resolve the 
repossession deficiency since 2008. 
 
8 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial 
counseling, and several delinquent debts are not resolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past 
irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for 
a security clearance. Applicant has resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.h, 1.j, 
1.k, and 1.l, and she is making regular payments on the delinquent taxes in SOR ¶ 1.c. 
However, she took no action to resolve these debts until she was questioned about 
them in April 2011. She did not begin paying her delinquent taxes for 2002 until May 
2012. She did not file her overdue 2010 state income tax return until she received the 
SOR. She did not resolve the traffic tickets until the month before the hearing. The 
evidence indicates that she resolved these debts to protect her security clearance and 
her job, and not because of a sense of duty or obligation to the creditors. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the debts that Applicant successfully disputed (SOR 
¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). She has not disputed the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, but her belief 
that it duplicates SOR ¶ 1.h is reasonable and plausible. When the same conduct is 
alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations 
should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 
21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Thus, I have treated SOR ¶ 1.i as disputed 
and resolved it in Applicant’s favor.  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required, as a matter of law, to 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a 
plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR 
be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant 
had no plan and took no significant actions to resolve her debts until the PSI, DOHA 
interrogatories, and SOR made it clear that her security clearance was at risk. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
9 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent 
to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a well-educated, talented, dedicated, hard-working employee with a 
reputation for good judgment, trustworthiness, and strong leadership. She served 
honorably in the U.S. Coast Guard and has held a clearance for more than 20 years. 
She is raising a teenage daughter alone and without financial assistance. She is deeply 
involved in a demanding job. Unfortunately, she has not paid attention to her financial 
affairs. Her explanation for not filing her state income tax return is telling—she simply 
was busy and forgot about it. She took virtually no actions to resolve the debts in the 
SOR until it was clear that her security clearance was at risk.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my 
obligation to decide close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.g:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.k-1.l:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.m:     Against Applicant 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
