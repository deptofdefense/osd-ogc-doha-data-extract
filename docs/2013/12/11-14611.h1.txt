HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 15 delinquent, charged-off, 
collection, or judgment accounts totaling $23,416. In May 1995 and December 2003, 
the Bankruptcy Court discharged her nonpriority, unsecured debts under Chapter 7 of 
the Bankruptcy Code. Circumstances largely beyond her control caused her recent 
delinquent debt. She made substantial progress resolving her financial problems and 
less than $3,000 of debt remains unresolved. Financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 1, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 3) On March 25, 2013, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On May 9, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived her 
right to a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated July 23, 2013, was provided to her on August 20, 2013.1 On October 22, 2013, 
Applicant responded to the FORM. On November 7, 2013, Department Counsel elected 
not to object to Applicant’s SOR response. The case was assigned to me on December 
6, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 
1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q. (Item 2; FORM at 2) She also provided: (1) 
explanations for her debts; (2) information about disputes for some debts; (3) payment 
information; and (4) other mitigating information. (Item 2) Her admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old accountant, who has worked for the same defense 
contractor for the last six years.3 (Item 3; FORM at 2) In 2005, she was awarded a 
bachelor of science degree in accounting. (Item 4) She has not served in the military. 
(Item 3) She has never married. (Item 3) Her daughter was born in 2006. (Item 4) 
Applicant disclosed several delinquent debts and two judgments on her April 1, 2011 SF 
86. (Item 3) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In September 2005, Applicant’s father died, and her mother moved in with 
Applicant. (Item 4) Applicant’s income decreased as she was unable to work overtime. 
Her mother did not work outside their home, and Applicant tried to pay her mother’s 
debts and keep her own debts current. (Item 4) On April 28, 2011 and July 7, 2011, 
Applicant discussed her delinquent debts with an Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) investigator during her personal subject interview (PSI). (Item 4) She attributed 
her delinquent debts to insufficient income, and in some instances, to incidents beyond 
her control. She did not receive child support payments from the father of her daughter. 
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated July 30, 2013, and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 20, 
2013. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after her receipt to submit 
information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3Applicant’s April 1, 2011 SF 86 is the basis for most of the facts in this paragraph. (Item 3) 
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
She and her daughter had some extraordinary medical expenses and numerous co-
pays for appointments, therapy, and pharmaceuticals. (Items 2 and 4; FORM response) 
Daycare and afterschool care for her daughter is a significant expense. (FORM 
response) She received some financial counseling in 2011 to help her with budgeting 
and expenses. (FORM response)  
  
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, OPM 
PSIs, SOR response, and FORM response. Applicant’s SOR lists 15 delinquent debts 
totaling $23,416 as follows: (1) and (2) state judgments in ¶ 1.a ($744) and ¶ 1.b 
($10,751); (3) to (11) medical debts in ¶ 1.c ($32), ¶ 1.d ($82), ¶ 1.e ($20), ¶ 1.f ($101), 
¶ 1.g ($52); ¶ 1.h ($899); ¶ 1.i ($300); ¶ 1.j ($943); and ¶ 1.n ($376); (12) 
telecommunications debt in ¶ 1.k ($257); (13) and (14) education debts in ¶ 1.l ($674) 
and 1.m ($7,940); and (15) credit card or bank debt in ¶ 1.o ($245). 
 
Bankruptcies 
 
The Bankruptcy Court discharged Applicant’s nonpriority, unsecured debts under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in May 1995 and December 2003. (SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 
1.q) Applicant did not specifically recall why she required bankruptcy in 1995; however, 
she suggested that she spent excessively and fell too far behind on her debts to recover 
financially without utilizing bankruptcy. (Item 4 at 80)  
 
Applicant’s real estate investments in 2003 were the primary cause of her second 
bankruptcy.4 In 2003, Applicant owned two houses. She lived in one house and utilized 
tenant payments to fund the mortgage and expenses on the other house. Expenses, 
repairs, and mortgage payments totaled more than her rent receipts. She used credit 
cards in an attempt to retain both houses. She eventually concluded that she could not 
afford the rental property because of her negative cash flow. The fair market value of 
her rental was less than her mortgage, and her expenses to complete the sale of the 
rental property were high. She subsequently moved out of the second house into an 
apartment, and she was unable to afford the mortgage payments, as she was a student. 
Her debts were substantial from her mortgage and credit cards, and she utilized 
bankruptcy for a fresh financial start. She did not indicate whether either of her 
properties were lost through foreclosure sales.    
 
Education Debts 
 
On March 11, 2013, a law firm handling one of her education debts wrote that the 
state judgment in ¶ 1.a ($744) was satisfied. (Item 2 at 8-9; FORM at 3; FORM 
response at 2-3) Applicant has an established payment plan addressing the state 
judgment in ¶ 1.b ($10,751) by paying $250 per month. (Item 2 at 11-12) As of April 15, 
2013, the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b was reduced to $8,708. (Item 2 at 12) As of August 5, 
2013, the balance was $7,773. (FORM response at 1)    
 
                                            
4The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response and FORM 
response. (Item 2 at 79, 82; FORM response)

Applicant made $100 payments in March and April 2013 to address the college 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($674), and this debt is shown on her July 2013 credit report as 
amounting to $391. (FORM at 4-5) On August 28, 2013, a law firm notified Applicant 
that the education debt in ¶ 1.l ($674) was resolved. (FORM response at 4-5) 
  
Applicant said the education debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($7,940) was the same debt as 
the education debt in SOR ¶ 1.b (now $7,773). (Item 2 at 76) Applicant has about 
$50,000 in student loan debt. (Item 5) Her July 15, 2013 credit report shows one student 
loan delinquent in the amount of $391 and another student loan delinquent in the 
amount of $2,099. (Item 5) She has a total of $2,390 in delinquent student loan debt 
reflected on her July 15, 2013 credit report; however, it does not appear that either of 
these debts is listed on her SOR. (Item 5) 
 
Medical Debts 
 
Applicant paid the medical debts in ¶ 1.c ($32), ¶ 1.d ($82), and ¶ 1.e ($20). 
(Item 2 at 14; Item 5 at 1; FORM at 3) She provided copies of the bills and a February 
11, 2011 paid medical invoice for $135. (Item 2 at 14-18)  
 
On April 24, 2013, Applicant paid the medical debts in ¶ 1.f ($101) and ¶ 1.g 
($52). (Item 2 at 19-24; Item 5 at 1; FORM at 3-4) She provided copies of the debit 
transactions from her account. (Item 2 at 20-21, 23-24) The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.n ($376) 
wrote, indicating the debt was no longer on Applicant’s account statement. (Item 2 at 
77; FORM response) 
 
Applicant’s insurance was transferred when she changed employment in 2007; 
however, she believes that she had insurance. The medical debts in SOR ¶ 1.h ($899) 
and ¶ 1.i ($300) are unpaid. (FORM at 4) Her July 15, 2013 credit report shows the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.i is disputed. (Item 5) She continues to dispute her responsibility for these 
two debts. (FORM response)  
 
Applicant settled and paid the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($943-settled). (FORM 
at 4) Applicant’s July 15, 2013 credit report does not indicate Applicant has any 
delinquent medical debts. (Item 5) 
 
Miscellaneous Debts 
 
Applicant contacted the creditor holding the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 
1.k ($257) and asked for documentation to support the debt. (FORM at 4; Item 2 at 64) 
The creditor was unable to locate original supporting documentation, and the creditor 
agreed to accept a dispute of the debt and suggested that she send a dispute to the 
credit reporting companies. (Item 2 at 64) The debt does not appear on her July 15, 
2013 credit report. (Item 5) 
 
Applicant’s SOR ¶ 1.o shows a $245 bank debt. Applicant contacted the creditor 
and learned the debt was transferred. (Item 2 at 78) She contacted the collection 
company and was advised that the debt did not show a balance as being due. (Item 2 at 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
78; FORM response) The original creditor appears on her July 15, 2013 credit report; 
however, it does not show any balance as being owed and the collection agent is not 
listed on her credit report. (Item 5)     
 
Applicant provided numerous receipts and account statements showing her 
payments of non-SOR debts. (Items 2, 4) Her records of medical copays and pharmacy 
bills were particularly numerous.   
 
Applicant generated a budget or personal financial statement. Her monthly gross 
salary is $5,005; her monthly net income is $4,277; her monthly expenses are $3,455; 
her monthly debt payments are $520; and her monthly net remainder is $302. (Item 4 at 
4) She has $35,617 in a retirement account and owns two used cars valued at $4,000. 
She does not have a car payment. (Item 4 at 4) 
 
In sum, her debts were resolved as follows: (1) and (2) state judgments in ¶ 1.a 
($744-paid) and ¶ 1.b ($10,751-payment plan); (3) to (11) medical debts in ¶ 1.c ($32-
paid), ¶ 1.d ($82-paid), ¶ 1.e ($20-paid), ¶ 1.f ($101-paid), ¶ 1.g ($52-paid); ¶ 1.h 
($899-disputed); ¶ 1.i ($300-disputed); ¶ 1.j ($943-settled); and ¶ 1.n ($376-paid); 
(12) telecommunications debt in ¶ 1.k ($257-disputed); (13) and (14) education debts in 
¶ 1.l ($674-paid) and 1.m ($7,940-payment plan (duplication of ¶ 1.b)); and (15) 
credit card or bank debt in ¶ 1.o ($245-disputed). 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided two character statements supporting approval of her access 
to classified information. (FORM response) Her character statements were from her 
supervisor from 2001 to 2005 and a college professor. They laud her dedication, 
determination, organizational skills, willingness to accept responsibility for her decisions, 
energy, intelligence, consistency, and perseverance.  
    
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, OPM PSI, SOR response, and FORM response. Applicant’s nonpriority, 
unsecured debt was discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in May 1995 
and December 2003. Her SOR lists 15 delinquent, charged-off, collection, or judgment 
accounts totaling $23,416. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained the Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Her bankruptcy in 2003 was caused by a decline in real estate values and 
expenses due to her rental property. Her financial problems after 2005 were caused 
when her mother moved in with her; she had a baby in 2006, and she did not receive 
child support; Applicant had insufficient income; and Applicant and her daughter had 
medical problems. Her financial problems were adversely affected by circumstances 
largely beyond her control. 
 
Applicant paid or settled and paid nine SOR debts as follows: ¶ 1.a ($744); ¶ 1.c 
($32); ¶ 1.d ($82); ¶ 1.e ($20); ¶ 1.f ($101); ¶ 1.g ($52); ¶ 1.j ($943); ¶ 1.n ($376), and ¶ 
1.l ($674). She disputed four SOR debts as follows: ¶ 1.h ($899); ¶ 1.i ($300); ¶ 1.k 
($257); and ¶ 1.o ($245). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($10,751) is in a payment plan (paid 
down to $7,773) and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($7,940) is a duplication of this debt.6 
                                                                                                                                            
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-

 Partial application of AG ¶ 20(c) is warranted. Applicant received some financial 
knowledge in the process of resolving her debts, and she generated a budget. She is a 
trained accountant. Although there is limited evidence of record that she established 
and maintained contact with her creditors,7 her financial problem is being resolved or is 
under control.     
  
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable actions to resolve her SOR debts, establishing some good faith. AG ¶ 20(e) 
is applicable to the four SOR debts she disputed that were removed from her credit 
report.    
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts after 2005 because of circumstances 
beyond her control. She paid or settled and paid nine SOR debts; she successfully 
disputed four SOR debts; and one SOR debt is in a payment plan. The only derogatory 
financial information on her July 15, 2013 credit report is a total of $2,390 in delinquent 
student loan debt, and this debt may be the student loan debt she is currently 
addressing in her established payment plan. She has established her financial 
responsibility. It is unlikely that financial problems will recur. Her efforts are sufficient to 
fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Assuming financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are 
mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old accountant, who has worked for the same defense 
contractor for the last six years. She earned a bachelor of science degree in accounting. 
Her daughter was born in 2006. She provides financial support to her mother. Two 
character references lauded her responsibility, perseverance, and maturity. She is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with her security responsibilities. She 
deserves substantial credit for supporting the U.S. Government as an employee of a 
contractor. There is every indication that she is loyal to the United States and her 
employer. Medical expenses for herself and her daughter, the failure of her daughter’s 
father to pay child support, and the necessity of providing support to her mother, 
contributed to Applicant’s financial woes.     
 
Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. Her SOR described the 
discharge of her nonpriority, unsecured debt under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
May 1995 and December 2003, as well as 15 delinquent, charged-off, collection, or 
judgment accounts totaling $23,416. Nevertheless, she acted responsibly to repair her 
finances. She paid or settled and paid nine SOR debts, successfully disputed four 
debts, and placed one debt in a payment plan. The Appeal Board has addressed a key 
element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an 
applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his [or her] 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust her. She has established a

“meaningful track record” of debt repayment. I am confident she will keep her promise to 
pay her remaining delinquent SOR debt and avoid future delinquent debt.8    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.q:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

8Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case 
No. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary 
security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her 
financial problems.” and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.
