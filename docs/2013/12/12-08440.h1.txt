Tuider, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 15 delinquent debts, totaling 
$162,057. Due to circumstances beyond his control, he had insufficient financial 
resources to pay his debts. Utilizing his retirement savings, he settled and paid six SOR 
debts, totaling $89,426, one debt is in a payment plan, and he is diligently working to 
resolve the last eight SOR debts totaling $35,631. Financial considerations concerns 
are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 16, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application. On April 8, 2013, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant, and it recommended

that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his 
clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On May 9, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
October 21, 2013, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on 
Applicant’s case. On October 24, 2013, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me. On October 31, 2013, DOHA issued a 
hearing notice, setting the hearing for December 4, 2013. Applicant’s hearing was held 
as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 5 exhibits, and Applicant offered 25 
exhibits, which were attached to his SOR answer. (Tr. 10, 17-19; GE 1-5; AE A-Y) One 
additional exhibit was provided in May 2013 after the other exhibits. (AE Z) There were 
no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-Z. (Tr. 18-19) On December 11, 2013, 
DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. The record was held open after the 
hearing until January 2, 2014 for additional evidence. (Tr. 68-69, 71) On January 2, 
2014, Department Counsel provided nine documents from Applicant, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection. (AE AA-II)  On February 3, 2014, Department 
Counsel provided one additional document from Applicant, which was admitted into 
evidence without objection. (AE JJ)   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as

From 2006 to 2011, Applicant was living on $2,000 a month that he received 
from his employer for disability in addition to his VA disability payments. (Tr. 32) He also 
had part-time employment. His total annual compensation for those five years averaged

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are consistently described in his SF 86, Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview, responses to DOHA 
interrogatories, SOR response, and hearing statement.  
 
Applicant’s credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($20,000) was settled and paid in April 
2013 for $3,010. (Tr. 40; AE V) His credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($5,972) resulted from 
a debt of about $1,100 in 2011. (Tr. 41) Applicant is working with the creditor on this 
debt to arrive at an appropriate settlement. (Tr. 41; AE HH) 
 
Applicant made two or three $50 payments to address the collection debt in SOR 
¶ 1.c ($1,120). (Tr. 41) He is working with the creditor on this debt to arrive at an 
appropriate settlement. (Tr. 41; AE HH) 
 
Applicant’s collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($4,642) was settled and paid in April 
2013 for $1,100. (Tr. 43; AE C) His department store credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.e 
($10,000) was settled and paid in April 2013 for $4,300. (Tr. 44; AE D) 
 
Applicant’s debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g were generated in 2006; they were 
secured by real estate; and each debt was for $37,000. (Tr. 44-45)  Applicant resolved 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f by paying a total of $7,500 by July 2013. (Tr. 45-46; AE B) He 
made 8 of 13 scheduled payments, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g will be resolved by April 
2014. (Tr. 46-48; AE HH) 
 
Applicant’s collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($7,305) resulted from a debt of about 
$3,500. (Tr. 48) His collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($4,861) resulted from the purchase of 
furniture. (Tr. 50) He is working with the creditors on these two debts to arrive at an 
appropriate settlement. (Tr. 48, 50; AE HH) 
 
Applicant’s department store collection debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($1,860) and 1.k 
($2,100) are unresolved because the creditors are checking on the amounts of the 
debts. (Tr. 50-52) He is working with the creditors to arrive at an appropriate settlement.

(Tr. 50-52; AE HH) His department store credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($1,670) was 
settled and paid in April 2013 for $751. (Tr. 52; AE F) 
 
Applicant’s bank collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($9,240) is unresolved. (Tr. 52-54) 
He is working with the creditor on this debt to arrive at an appropriate settlement. (Tr. 
52-54; AE HH) 
 
Applicant’s debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($3,173) resulted from the purchase of a time-
share in a vacation property in the mid-1990s. (Tr. 54) The amount listed in his credit 
report is from fees and assessments; Applicant has attempted to terminate the time-
share agreement; and he has not used the time share in more than 10 years. (Tr. 54; 
AE HH) The bank debt in SOR ¶ 1.o ($16,114) was settled and paid in April 2013 for 
$3,500. (Tr. 55-56; AE W) 
 
In 2011 or 2012, Applicant had financial counseling through his church, and he 
consulted an attorney about his options. (Tr. 62-63) He owns a home valued at about 
$160,000 and his mortgage is about $250,000. (Tr. 64-65) He makes $1,000 monthly 
payments, and the remainder of the interest is added onto the loan. (Tr. 65) Applicant 
does not use credit cards except for one card from his company and one from a tire 
company. (Tr. 53) He pays $300 monthly through an automatic payment to address his 
spouse’s student loans. (Tr. 58) Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) shows 
the following monthly amounts: gross salary $6,338; net income $5,554; expenses 
$3,190; debts $1,911; and net remainder $453. (Tr. 61; GE 2 at 34) The five debts listed 
on his PFS are non-SOR debts that are all in current status. (GE 2 at 34) 
   
In sum, Applicant settled and paid the six debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($20,000), 1.d 
($4,642), 1.e ($10,000), 1.f ($37,000), 1.l ($1,670), and 1.o ($16,114), totaling $89,426 
in April and May 2013. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($37,000) is in an established payment 
plan. The remaining eight debts total $35,631. In December 2014, Applicant made 
settlement offers on several of his remaining unresolved SOR debts. (AE GG, II) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
A coworker and friend, who observed Applicant on a daily basis, described 
Applicant as diligent, trustworthy, energetic, and committed to providing a high-quality 
work product to his employer. (Tr. 73-74)   
 
Applicant provided 19 letters from friends, supervisors, and colleagues. (AE A) 
Those letters lauded his honesty, reliability, generosity, dedication, professionalism, 
tireless efforts on behalf of his employer, and contributions to the accomplishments of 
his company.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, OPM interview, SOR response, and statement at his hearing.  
 
Applicant’s debts became delinquent when he became disabled in 2004 and 
2005. Applicant’s SOR alleges and he admitted responsibility for 15 delinquent debts, 
totaling $162,057. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
to 20(d). AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. Although Applicant disputed or questioned the 
claimed amounts of some of his delinquent debts, Applicant did not dispute his 
responsibility for any of his delinquent SOR debts. In 2004, Applicant was electrocuted 
and fell off of a ladder, and in 2005, Applicant injured his neck in a car accident.  His 
income was significantly reduced, which caused Applicant to have debts he could not 
afford to pay. His financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond his 
control. He borrowed from his retirement fund, and in April to May 2013, he settled and 
paid six SOR debts, totaling $89,426. He placed one debt into a payment plan, and he 
is diligently working to resolve the last eight SOR debts totaling $35,631.1  
 
The Appeal Board explained that circumstances beyond one’s control can cause 
unresolved debt, and are not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). Applicant admitted 
responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts, 
                                            
1
 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

establishing some good faith.2 He established and maintained contact with his 
creditors.3 He used his limited resources to settle and pay six large delinquent SOR 
debts. His financial problem is being resolved or is under control. Applicant has learned 
from his financial mistakes, and they are unlikely to recur. They do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His efforts are sufficient to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Assuming financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are mitigated under the 
whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
                                            
2
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old systems engineer and project manager, who has 
worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since March 2012. He was 
awarded an associate’s degree in electronics technology in 1991. He served in the 
Navy from 1979 to 1988. He was on the promotion list for petty officer first class (E-6) 
when he left active duty. He has a service-connected VA disability rating of 80%. He is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He 
deserves substantial credit for supporting the U.S. Government as an employee of a 
contractor and as a Navy enlisted man. There is every indication that he is loyal to the 
United States and his employer. Injuries in 2004 and 2005 and underemployment 
contributed to his financial woes. I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting 
responsibility for his delinquent debts in his SF 86, responses to DOHA interrogatories, 
OPM PSI, SOR response, and at his hearing. He received 20 favorable endorsements 
from friends, supervisors, and colleagues.  
 
Even though Applicant lacked financial resources because of his injuries and 
underemployment, he borrowed from his retirement account and settled and paid six 
SOR debts, totaling $89,426. One $37,000 debt is in a payment plan, and he is 
diligently working to resolve the last eight SOR debts totaling $35,631.  He promised to 
continue to attempt to resolve all of his delinquent debts. Because of his current 
employment, he now has additional financial resources to resolve his remaining SOR 
debts and not accrue additional delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a 
key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands what he needs to do to 
establish and maintain his financial responsibility. There is simply no reason not to trust 
him. Moreover, he established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. I am 
confident he will maintain his financial responsibility.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.o:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
