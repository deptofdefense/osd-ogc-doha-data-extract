Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. There is substantial evidence
establishing a history of financial problems or difficulties, but he presented sufficient
evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Accordingly, this
case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On or about April 30, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR on May 28, 2013. Neither Applicant nor Department
Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the written record.2
Thereafter, on July 31, 2013, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and
material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant3
material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it August 13, 2013. He did not
reply within the 30-day period allowed under the Directive. The case was assigned to
me October 17, 2013.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance for his job as an embedded software engineer. He has
worked in that capacity since 2000 except for a two-month period in 2005, when he was
unemployed. He has worked for his current employer since 2005. His educational
background includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in 1993. He has been married since
2006, and he and his wife have a son who was born in 2010.  
There is substantial evidence that Applicant has a history of financial problems or
difficulties.  He attributes his negative financial history to obtaining a home-equity loan4
to invest in the stock market (it did not end well) as well as delinquent accounts due to
forgetting to make payments.  The SOR alleged five accounts in some form of5
delinquency, and they are discussed below seriatim. 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that $1,228 was past due on a home-equity loan, which had a
balance of $148,000. Applicant denied this allegation in his Answer, explaining that the
account was current and in good standing. Although the account was past due as of

March 2013,  the most recent credit report from July 2013 confirms his explanation.6 7
That credit report shows the account was opened in December 2005 with a balance of
$150,000. It also shows that the account was closed at Applicant’s request in June
2013, it has a balance of $148,000, and it is not past due. 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleged a $13,724 charged-off account owed to a major credit card
company. Applicant denied this allegation in his Answer, explaining that he is currently
making a $300 monthly payment on the account. The charged-off account is reflected in
the March 2013 credit report.  And it appears in the July 2013 credit report with a8
balance of $12,524, which shows he made four $300 monthly payments.9
SOR ¶ 1.c alleged that $407 was past due on a credit card account. Applicant
admitted this allegation in his Answer, explaining that he was working with the creditor
to resolve the account. The March 2013 credit report shows the account as $407 past
due with a balance of $2,212. The July 2013 credit report shows it as $1,191 past due
with a balance of $2,212.  
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged that $598 was past due on an account with a balance of
$8,223 as reflected in a February 2012 credit report.  Applicant admitted this allegation10
in his Answer, explaining that he had contacted the creditor and established a $274
monthly payment plan to pay off the remaining balance. This account does not appear
in the March or July 2013 credit reports.  11
SOR ¶ 1.e alleged that foreclosure proceedings were initiated against Applicant
due to defaulting on a second mortgage loan. Applicant admitted this allegation in his
Answer, explaining that the foreclosure was related to his primary mortgage loan, which
was subsequently brought current and is in good standing. As conceded by Department
Counsel, the July 2013 credit report confirms his explanation.12
Applicant provided a personal financial statement in response to interrogatories.13
In summary, that statement shows the following: (1) a household net monthly income of
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to14
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As14
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt15
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An16
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  17
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting18
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An19
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate20
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme21
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it24
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant25
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 26
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  27
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more28 29
than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions.

 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 32

There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  Given the evidence here,30
I have considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to replay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
As established in the findings of fact, Applicant’s financial problems are not
insignificant, but those matters are now largely resolved. He resolved the two
delinquencies related to his home, as both the home-equity loan and mortgage loan are
current and in good standing. He also began a monthly payment plan on the largest
unsecured debt. The two unresolved matters are relatively smaller sums and he has the
financial means to resolve them. Moreover, his personal financial statement shows he is
not financially overextended, thereby reducing any potential risk of having to engage in
illegal acts to generate funds.  
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and31
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.32
Based on the available evidence, Applicant has taken enough significant actions to
mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. Applicant has not presented a perfect
case in mitigation, but he has presented enough evidence of his efforts to clean up his

fiscal house, and I am persuaded he will resolve the remaining delinquent debts in due
course. 
After weighing the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating
the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant presented33
sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the security concern. Accordingly,
I conclude he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
