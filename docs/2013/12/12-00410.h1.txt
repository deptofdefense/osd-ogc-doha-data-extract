DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 23, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action 
was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
On August 16, 2013, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on September 25, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 28, 2013, and the hearing was 
convened as scheduled on November 20, 2013. At the hearing, Department Counsel 
 
2 
 
offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant testified and offered 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A thorough G. The record was left open until November 27, 
2013, for Applicant to submit additional matters. He timely submitted documents that 
were marked as AE H through BB. All offered exhibits were admitted into evidence 
without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 2, 2013.  
 
Amendment to the SOR 
 
At the hearing, I amended Paragraph 1 of the SOR to add the following 
allegation: 
  
j. You failed to report your income on your 2010 federal income tax return 
   as required by law.   
 
The basis for this amendment is set forth below. Neither party objected to that 
amendment.1  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for his current employer since May 2011. He graduated from high school in 
1997. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from May 1997 to December 2003, 
attained the grade of specialist (E-4), and received an honorable discharge. He married 
in 2010. His wife is unemployed. He and his wife have a one-year-old child. He thought 
that he may have held a security clearance in the Army, but was not sure whether he 
had one.2  
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2009 and 2010 in violation of 26 U.S. Code § 7203 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) and that 
he had seven delinquent debts, totaling $15,921. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted four of the alleged debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g), totaling $14,935, and 
denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.3 
 
 Applicant attributed his financial problems to a period of underemployment from 
October 2009 to March 2010. At that time, he had irregular employment and mostly 
worked part-time performing home repairs. At the hearing, Applicant also acknowledged 
that he was fiscally irresponsible before his child was born.4 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b – failure to file 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns. In 
his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided copies of his federal income tax returns for

tax years 2009 and 2010. Those tax returns were signed and dated August 13, 2013. 
His 2009 federal income tax return reflected that his adjusted gross income was 
$19,625 and that he was entitled to a tax refund of $711. He filed a joint income tax 
return for 2010 that reflected his and his wife’s adjusted gross income was $2,500 and 
that they were entitled to a tax refund of $1,250.5 
 
  At the hearing, Applicant explained that he worked in Canada for about three 
months in 2009. He went to tax preparers for assistance in filing his 2009 federal 
income tax return, but they were not familiar with the rules for reporting foreign earned 
income. They declined to prepare his income tax return for that year. He testified that he 
never thought of calling the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for guidance or assistance.6 
 
 In about August or September 2011, Applicant again went to a tax preparer for 
assistance in filing his 2009 federal income tax return. He provided the tax preparer with 
paperwork for preparing that tax return. He then periodically contacted the tax preparer 
about the status of that tax return. The tax preparer repeatedly told him that they would 
get back in touch with him when it was ready, but they failed do so. In July 2013, the 
SOR was issued, and he again contacted the tax preparer. At that time, the tax preparer 
informed him that they lost his paperwork and advised him to contact the IRS to obtain 
copies of the lost documents. He contacted the IRS, obtained the lost documents, and 
filed his 2009 federal income tax return on August 13, 2013.7    
 
 The facts surrounding Applicant’s filing of his 2010 federal income tax return are 
confusing. In responding to interrogatories in April 2013, Applicant was asked if he filed 
that income tax return, he checked the block “no”, but attached a copy of a 2010 Form 
1040EZ that was prepared for him and his wife. It was signed by the tax preparer on 
March 3, 2011, which was within the allotted period for submitting that tax return. 
Applicant also provided a 2010 IRS e-file Signature Authorization form that was also 
dated and signed by the tax preparer, but was not signed by Applicant or his wife. The 
2010 Form 1040EZ reflected that he and his wife had $10,066 in income. In responding 
to the interrogatories, he also stated: 
 
2010 I have not turned in because I worked under the table by [named 
company]. I only made approximately $3,000.00 total that year. . . .  I did 
jointly file 2010 taxes with my wife, but I did not claim anything due to only 
making approximately $3,000 that year.8 
 
There is no indication that DOD security clearance adjudicators ever questioned 
Applicant further about this inconsistency in the interrogatories about whether he filed

his federal income tax return for 2010. The SOR was issued in July 2013 and, as noted 
above, alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax return for 2010.9 
 
 When Applicant sought his 2009 tax documentation from the IRS in July 2013, he 
also requested his 2010 tax documentation. For 2010, he received from the IRS a 
document showing that he was paid $2,500 for a stop-loss reimbursement that 
pertained to his military service. In August 2013, he filed a joint Form 1040 reporting just 
the $2,500 stop-loss reimbursement as their income for 2010. He provided that 2010 
Form 1040 in his answer to the SOR.10 
 
 In discussing tax year 2010 at the hearing, Applicant indicated that he did not 
make much money that year and stated that “most of the money I made was working 
under the table” for a company. He acknowledged that he did not receive a W-2 
Statement or 1099 Form reporting that income and did not include that income on his 
federal income tax return for 2010. Based on his testimony, I amended the SOR to add 
the allegation quoted above as SOR ¶ 1.j. When asked whether he was attempting to 
evade paying his taxes by not reporting that income, Applicant looked shocked. He 
indicated that he had no intent to violate the law and thought he did not have to report 
that income. He indicated that the amount he received “under the table” was about 
$3,000. He asked if he could redo his income tax return and was advised there is a 
process for amending federal tax returns. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a 
Form 1040X that amended his 2010 Form 1040. The amended tax return reported that 
he and his wife had $2,788 of income that they had not previously reported. This 
amendment reflected their total income for 2010 was $5,288.11 According to IRS 
Publication 17 for 2010, a married couple filing jointly who were both less than 65 years 
old did not need to file a 2010 federal income tax return if their gross income was less 
than $18,700. The total income that Applicant and his wife reported on their Form 
1040EZ and Form 1040X was only $15,354. Nevertheless, Applicant may still have 
been required to file for 2010, because Social Security and Medicare taxes most likely 
were not deducted from his “under the table” pay.12 
 
 At the hearing, he testified that he had filed his federal income tax returns for 
2011 and 2012. In responding to interrogatories, he provided a copy of his 2011 federal 
income tax return.13 
                                                          
9 GE 3.  At the hearing, Applicant also was not questioned about the Form 1040EZ.  
10 Tr. at 28-34; Applicant’s answer to the SOR; GE 2, 3. 
11 The Form 1040X does not appear to have been prepared properly because it did not include 
his wife’s income of $10,066 initially reported in the 2010 Form 1040EZ. This error was apparently due to 
a misunderstanding of the requirements. The transcript indicated that Applicant stated he received $2,000 
“under the table” in 2010. See Tr. at 73. However, I distinctly remember him saying $3,000 at the hearing. 
My hearing notes also indicated he said $3,000.

 SOR ¶ 1.c – collection account for $308. This debt was a cellphone account that 
had a date of last activity of April 2011. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a 
letter from the collection company showing this debt was paid in full on August 9, 
2013.14 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d – charged-off account for $5,152. This debt was a motorcycle loan 
that Applicant acquired in about 2006. His monthly loan payments were about $300. 
The date of last activity on this account was December 2007. He still retains possession 
of the motorcycle, but it is no longer a registered vehicle. He has not yet contacted the 
creditor to resolve this debt because he intended to address other debts first. He 
provided bank records showing that he has saved $1,345 that he intends to use in 
settling this debt.15 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e – charged-off account for $1,449. This allegation is a duplicate of the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.f, below.16 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f – charged-off account for $850. This debt was a credit card account 
that was opened in September 2005 and had a date of last activity of October 2008. At 
the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from a collection agency reflecting that this 
account was settled in full on October 11, 2013. He testified that he made two payments 
of $438 to resolve this debt.17 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g – charged-off account for $7,484. This was a debt consolidation loan 
that was opened in August 2007 and had a date of last activity of November 2011. 
Applicant indicated that he had not yet contacted this creditor to resolve this debt.18 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h – collection account for $483. This was a debt owed to a city for a 
traffic violation. This account had a date of last activity of December 2008. At the 
hearing, he provided a document from the collection agency showing that he made two 
payments in August 2013 to satisfy this debt.19

 SOR ¶ 1.i – collection account for $195. This debt was a utility bill that had a date 
of last activity of May 2010. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a letter from a 
creditor showing that this account was paid in full on August 9, 2013.20 
 
 Applicant testified that his current annual net income is about $50,000. In a post-
hearing submission, he indicated that his monthly income was $3,995 and his monthly 
expenses were about $3,291, which left him a net monthly remainder of about $703. He 
also provided a credit report from November 2013 that reflected he had incurred no new 
or recent delinquent debts. At the time of the hearing, he stated that he had about 
$1,500 in his checking account and about $1,500 in a 401(k) account.21 
 
 Applicant indicated that he intended to pay the alleged debts. In his post-hearing 
submission, he provided a plan for satisfying the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.g by 
making monthly payments and applying his next tax refund toward those debts. He 
estimated that he would pay off both debts in the next 12 months.22 
 
 Applicant was open and forthcoming about his finances and debts. I found him to 
be a credible witness. While on active duty in the Army, he served in Iraq for six months. 
He was awarded the Air Medal for Valor and that Army Achievement Medal.23  
 
 Policies  
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this

decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;   
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, 
 
8 
 
filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches 
of trust; and 
 
(g) failure to file Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or 
the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Applicant failed to file his 2009 federal income tax return as required. AG ¶ 19(g) 
applies to SOR ¶ 1.a.  
 
 Applicant filed his 2010 federal income tax return within the set time limits, but 
did not report the proper amount of his income. He testified that he received income 
“under the table” in 2010 and initially failed to report that income. When questioned at 
the hearing about whether he was attempting to evade paying his taxes by not reporting 
that income, Applicant testified that he never realized he had to report that income and 
was not attempting to violate the law. I found his testimony credible. His omission in 
reporting his income was not an attempt to submit a fraudulent tax return or to evade 
taxes, but due to a lack of understanding of the requirements. He later filed an amended 
income tax return reporting the “under the table” income. AG ¶ 19(d) does not apply. AG 
¶ 19(g) does not apply to SOR ¶ 1.b. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.j.  
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts over an extended period that he was 
unable or unwilling to satisfy. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply to his delinquent debts.  
 
  Several financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;   
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
9 
 
 In 2009, Applicant attempted to file his federal income tax return on time, but 
was unable to find a tax preparer familiar with the rules concerning foreign earned 
income. In 2011, he provided a tax preparer with his tax paperwork for 2009. 
Periodically, he checked with the tax preparer about the status of his income tax return 
and was advised that he would be contacted when the tax return was ready. In about 
July 2013, he learned the tax preparer lost his paperwork. He contacted the IRS to 
obtain the missing documents. In August 2013, he filed his federal income tax return for 
2009. He always intended to file that tax return. His failure to file that tax return as 
required by law occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG ¶ 20(a) 
applies to SOR ¶ 1.a. 
 
 Even though he experienced periods of underemployment, Applicant admitted 
that he acted in a fiscally irresponsible manner before the birth of his child. AG ¶ 20(b) 
does not apply.  
 
 Since the issuance of the SOR, Applicant has focused on resolving his 
delinquent debts. He paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. He testified that he 
intends to pay the two remaining debts. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a 
plan for paying them. While it will take a number of months for him to pay those debts, 
he has shown that he is committed to resolving his financial problems. Additionally, his 
most recent credit report shows that he is living within his means and has not incurred 
any recent delinquent debts. I find that AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.f. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to SOR ¶ 1.e. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
 
10 
 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant served honorably in the Army. He served in Iraq and was awarded an 
Air Medal for Valor. Since the issuance of the SOR, he has realized the importance of 
taking care of his financial problems and has taken sufficient steps to show he is 
committed to resolving his debts. His current financial situation is under control, and his 
delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no 
questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under 
Guideline F.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
