GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
alcohol consumption. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 24, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him an interview verification 
request.  He responded to the request on April 28, 2012.2 On another unspecified date, 
the DOD CAF issued him another interview verification request.  He responded to that 
request on April 28, 2012.3 On another unspecified date, the DOD CAF issued him a set

of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on April 28. 2012.4 On another 
unspecified date, the DOD CAF issued him another set of interrogatories. He responded 
to the interrogatories on June 5, 2012.5 On another unspecified date, the DOD CAF 
issued him another set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories on July 
6, 2012.6 On May 2, 2013, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 8, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated May 
28, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on July 23, 
2013. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on September 11, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 26, 
2013. 
 
 During the hearing, 11 Government exhibits (GEs 1 through GE 11) and 4 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A through AE D) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. Several allegations in the SOR were either amended or deleted, as 
described further below. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 11, 2013. I kept 
the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted seven additional documents, which were marked as exhibits 
(AEs E through AE K) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed 
on October 11, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c. through 1.e., and 1.h.), and six of the 
factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (¶¶ 2.a., 2.c. through 2.e., 2.h., 
and 2.i.). He denied the remaining allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the

record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since April 
2010, has served as a full-time training specialist.7 He was previously a part-time self-
employed training specialist, full-time marketing and training representative, full-time 
merchandiser, part-time laborer, full-time corporate sales trainer/account executive, and 
part-time contract training specialist.8 He was also unemployed for various periods 
during 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008.9 Applicant served on active duty with the U.S. Navy 
from January 1990 until January 2000, when he was honorably discharged.10 He was 
granted a confidential security clearance in 1999,11 which was subsequently upgraded 
to secret.12 An August 1989 high school general educational development (GED) 
recipient, Applicant attended several colleges periodically between 1989 and 2008, but 
did not obtain a degree.13 He was married in September 1989, and divorced in 
September 1992.14 Applicant has a son born in December 1990 and a daughter born in 
January 1995.15  
 
Military Awards and Decorations 
 
 During his 10-year military career, Applicant was awarded the following awards 
and decorations: Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (3 awards), Joint 
Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Meritorious Unit 
Commendation, Navy “E” Ribbon (3 awards), Navy Good Conduct Medal (2 awards), 
National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal (2 awards), Navy Sea 
Deployment Ribbon (3 awards), and Kuwait Liberation Medal.16 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until various periods 
during 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008, when he was essentially unemployed or working in 
part-time jobs. Applicant identified 2007 as a particularly tough time for him because he

was not making sufficient income as a self-employed contract trainer to make his 
monthly payments.17 As a result, income taxes went unpaid, and various accounts 
became past due, placed for collection, charged off, went to repossession, or 
transferred or sold to other collection agents or debt buyers.18 
In April 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
monthly net income of $2,474; monthly household, utility, transportation, and food 
expenses of $2,005; and zero monthly debt repayments, leaving a monthly remainder of 
$469 available for discretionary savings or expenditures.19 Applicant also furnished 
earnings statements from his employer reflecting his gross and net pay for pay periods 
between June 2011 and March 2012.20  
The SOR identified eight delinquent debts totaling $25,675 that had been placed 
for collection, charged off, or went to repossession, as generally reflected by a 2010 and 
two 2012 credit reports.21 Some accounts listed in the credit reports have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in some instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. 
Several accounts are listed with only partial account numbers. Those debts listed in the 
SOR, and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.) There is one electric utility account in the amounts of 
$105 or $106 that was placed for collection seriatim with three different collection 
agents or debt purchasers in April 2010, September 2010, and December 2011. Three 
different account numbers were assigned to the account.22 Applicant contacted the 
collection agents to confirm his suspicion and informed the DOD adjudicator that the 
accounts were duplicates.23 One of the collection agents responded to his inquiry and 
furnished a statement reflecting an unpaid balance of $105.69.24 Applicant paid the 
collection agent $105.69 on October 8, 2013.25 I conclude the debt has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.) There is a medical account with an unspecified medical provider 
with a balance of $690 that was placed for collection in 2011.26 Neither the March 2012 
credit report nor the SOR identified the provider. Applicant was unable to acquire a 
statement for services from an identified creditor with the identical balance, and was 
informed that collection was no longer being pursued.27 Applicant has taken reasonable 
efforts to identify the creditor to resolve the account, but has been unable to do so in 
light of the paucity of information about the account in the credit reports and the SOR. 
He has taken no further action regarding the account.28 The account is no longer listed 
in Applicant’s August 2012 or May 2013 credit reports.29 Accordingly, although there is 
no evidence that Applicant has paid the creditor, I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.) There is a medical account with an unspecified medical provider 
with a balance of $199 that was placed for collection in 2008.30 Neither the March 2012 
or August 2012 credit reports nor the SOR identified the provider. The June 2010 credit 
report identified the collection agent, but not the creditor.31 Applicant contacted the 
collection agent, and on October 8, 2013, he paid the collection agent $199.32 I 
conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.) Applicant is the noncustodial parent of his daughter born in 1995. 
He was ordered to pay the child’s mother $397 per month, commencing in December 
1996. He did so until January 2003, but stopped from February until October 2003. He 
resumed his payments in November 2003, generally adding an extra $25, and 
subsequently made even larger monthly payments. He made periodic payments, but 
missed several, during 2007 – 2011.33 Through February 17, 2011, there was a child 
support arrearage of $13,269.16.34 Applicant indicated his wages were garnished from 
1997 until July 2010 when the mother and child moved to another state, and the state 
garnishing his wages was unable to continue doing so because it had lost jurisdiction 
over the case. Applicant was unable to make the continuing payments until the new 
state had acquired jurisdiction.35 Because his daughter is now 18 years old, Applicant 
no longer has any child support obligations. He was not delinquent on current child

support, but did have a past due balance of $50 as of May 23, 2013.36 The total 
arrearage was reduced to $8,626.63, and effective June 8, 2013, Applicant was 
obligated to pay the state $50 per month until that balance is paid off.37 I conclude the 
debt is in the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.) There is an account with a telecommunications company with an 
unpaid balance of $272 that was placed for collection in 2010, and sold to a debt 
purchaser, claiming to be a factoring company.38 Applicant contacted the debt 
purchaser and agreed to a settlement. He paid the debt purchaser $50 on April 10, 
2012, over a year before the SOR was issued, and the account is considered paid in 
full.39 I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.) There is a deferred student loan with a high credit of $3,500 that 
was 180 days past due when it was assigned to the Government in February 2010, 
leaving a zero balance.40 The account was transferred to another creditor who 
increased the high credit to $3,789, leaving a past due balance of $4,393.41 In June 
2011, Applicant paid the creditor $479, and in September 2011, Applicant entered a 
rehabilitation agreement, under which he continued to make monthly payments of $69.42 
The rehabilitated loan account was sold to a bank in March 2012.43 As of April 2012, the 
balance had been reduced to $3,357, and the account was considered by the creditor to 
be current, with a note that Applicant was paying as agreed.44 I conclude the debt has 
been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.) There is a loan to finance an automobile in mid-2009 for 
approximately $10,000. After making monthly payments of $320 for about four or five 
months, and then falling behind in his payments, Applicant advised the dealership 
where he had purchased the vehicle that he was experiencing financial hardship. 
Applicant contends the dealership conferred with the finance company that had 
threatened repossession and resolved the situation. Applicant subsequently was able to

catch up with his delinquent payments, and as of June 2010, was making two payments 
of $160 per month.45 Applicant retained possession of the vehicle until sometime after 
he was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in February 2011.46  
 
The June 2010, March 2012, and August 2012 credit reports reveal a different 
story. The high credit on the account was reflected as $9,751, with $562 past due with 
an outstanding balance of $7,819. The vehicle was purportedly involuntarily 
repossessed in January 2010.47 Applicant denied the vehicle was repossessed. He 
believes the threat of repossession was erroneously reported to the credit reporting 
agencies, and that the information was never corrected after the agreement was 
reached with the finance company.48 He contends that after the registration expired on 
the vehicle that was parked at his condominium, the new condominium association had 
the vehicle impounded and eventually sold.49 Applicant attempted to contact the 
dealership but learned it had gone out of business.50 He contacted the finance company 
and was told it had not repossessed the vehicle.51 Applicant requested a bill from the 
finance company, but it refused to send him one because the account had been 
previously sold back to the dealership.52  
 
In June 2010, the state issued a final order in which it was determined that the 
finance company in question, which has a Better Business Bureau accreditation of F on 
a scale of A+ to F,53 had been operating without a current, active license.54 The account 
is no longer listed in Applicant’s May 2013 credit report.  Applicant has taken 
reasonable efforts to locate and pay the creditor to resolve the account, but one creditor 
is out of business and the finance company disavowed ownership of the account. 
Additionally, aside from the entry in the credit reports, an entry which Applicant has 
repeatedly disputed and denied, there is no evidence that the vehicle was actually 
repossessed. Accordingly, although there is no evidence that Applicant has paid the 
creditor, I conclude the debt has been resolved. 
 
Applicant has resolved or is in the process of resolving any other delinquent 
debts, including those that were not alleged in the SOR, such as his income tax and

credit card accounts. His plan is to continue making payments until all of his accounts 
are current.55 Applicant contacted a debt consolidation service at some unspecified 
time, but was advised that he did not qualify for such services, and thus, has not 
received any financial counseling or debt consolidation services.56 
 
Alcohol Consumption57 
 
 Applicant first started tasting alcohol at the age of four or five when he would take 
sips from his father’s beer. When he was in the eighth grade he began consuming beer 
on his own for social interaction. Applicant’s relationship with, or consumption of, beer 
has resulted in three alcohol-related incidents.  
 
(SOR ¶ 2.b.) The first such incident occurred in May 1987, when, at the age of 
17, Applicant was stopped for not wearing a seat belt. When the officer observed beer 
in the vehicle, he took Applicant to the police station and called Applicant’s mother, who 
came to pick him up. Applicant was charged with DUI, but when the officer failed to 
appear in court, and the charge was dismissed.58 No further actions regarding the 
incident were taken against Applicant. 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.c.) In October 1998, after spending the day on base playing volleyball 
and consuming six or seven beers, Applicant was stopped for driving approximately 62 
miles per hour (mph) in a 50 mph zone. He admitted to the officer that he had been 
drinking earlier. The officer administered a field sobriety test, which Applicant failed. At 
the police station, Applicant was administered a Breathalyzer which registered 0.14 or 
0.15. He was arrested, charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI),59 and after 
spending four or five hours in jail, he was released to his supervisor.60 Applicant was 
sentenced to 20 hours of community service and ordered to attend five meetings of 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).61 He completed both, and he did not receive any military 
discipline for the incident.62

 During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶¶ 2.c., 2.d., and 2.f. There was no 
objection to the motions. As a result, the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.c. and 2.f. were altered to conform to the evidence, 
and SOR ¶ 2.d. was deleted in its entirety. See, Tr. at 55-57, 62-63.

59
 The SOR initially alleged Applicant had been arrested in state X in November 1988 and charged with 
driving under the intoxicating influence of alcohol, narcotics, or pathogenic drugs (DUI). The SOR was amended to 
reflect the arrest took place in November 1998 in state Z. See, Tr. at 56. There is no police or court record in 
evidence to support the allegation as initially alleged or subsequently amended. It should be noted that the alcohol-
related driving offense in state Z is actually operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI), and there is no violation 
under the state’s law referred to as “driving under the intoxicating influence of alcohol, narcotics, or pathogenic 
drugs.” That violation does, however, exist under the laws of state X.

 (SOR ¶ 2.e.) In September 2010, after drinking an unspecified quantity of beer 
and socializing with friends while watching a football game at a bar, Applicant left the 
bar and drove to a convenience store. It was shortly past midnight when he was 
observed by a police officer driving, without his headlights on, into the parking space. 
The officer approached him, and smelling the odor of alcohol coming from Applicant, 
asked if Applicant had consumed alcohol. Applicant responded that he had consumed 
two drinks, but knew that he had consumed more than that.  The officer administered a 
field sobriety test, which Applicant failed. A search of Applicant’s vehicle uncovered four 
open beer containers. Applicant was taken into custody and driven to the police station 
where he refused to take a Breathalyzer test. He was arrested, charged with DUI, and 
after spending the rest of the morning in jail, he was released.63  
 
In February 2011, the charge was reduced to reckless driving with alcohol, and 
Applicant entered a plea of no contest. He was adjudicated guilty of the reduced charge, 
and sentenced to supervised probation for six months; fines and costs of $1,013; 50 
hours of community service over the probation period or 102 hours of community 
service in lieu of fine and costs; ordered to attend DUI First Offender Program and the 
Victim Impact Panel; complete alcohol treatment and counseling as required by law; 
and his driving privilege was revoked for six months.64 He successfully completed all of 
the conditions of probation.65 
 
 In January 2011, Applicant acknowledged he generally consumed four to five 
beers in one sitting, at a bar, and reached the point of intoxication once per week. He 
defined intoxication as “stumbling and slurring.” Applicant denied that he has ever 
attempted to reduce his alcohol consumption despite having some previous alcohol-
related incidents. He denied ever being professionally diagnosed as abusing alcohol or 
as being alcohol dependent.66 However, after his arrest but before his February 2011 
sentencing, things started to deteriorate. Since he could not drive, he essentially was 
stuck at home, bored, watching television, and consuming “a lot of beer.” He started 
consuming over a 12-pack of beer a day. One day, his management team smelled the 
odor of stale alcohol on him at work, and frightened he would lose his job, Applicant 
sought help from the employee assistance program (EAP).67 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.f.) In April 2011, Applicant was clinically assessed by the EAP. Based 
on his signs and symptoms, his daily consumption of an 18-pack of beer per day, his 
depression, and his alleged problem of being an alcoholic, the EAP recommended him 
for out-patient counseling.68 Despite Applicant’s belief that his assigned counselor was a

doctor,69 she is not. She has a master’s of science degree (MS), and is a licensed 
mental health counselor (LMHC), a certified prevention professional (CPP), and board 
certified professional counselor (BCPC).70 Applicant received individual counseling, and 
underwent routine 90-minute mental health examinations, psychosocial assessments, 
and risk assessments, and received current diagnoses, commencing in April 2011, 
which continued until November 2011.71 The counselor recommended that Applicant 
attend AA meetings in lieu of her counseling sessions.72 
 
The counselor’s therapy notes reveal an appropriate diagnosis in the format 
established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
– Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). A multiaxial system was developed which involves an 
assessment on several axes, each of which refers to a different domain of information 
that may help the clinician plan treatment and predict outcome. There are five such 
axes in the DSM-IV multiaxial classification: Axis I: clinical disorders and other 
conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention; Axis II: personality disorders & 
mental retardation; Axis III: general medical conditions; Axis IV: psychosocial and 
environmental problems; and Axis V: global assessment of functioning (GAF).73 A 
nonaxial format is also available for those choosing not to use the multiaxial format, but 
all the relevant disorders and conditions should be recorded.  
 
Applicant’s Axis I diagnosis was depression from April 19, 2011 until June 20, 
2011; and depression/rule out attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from July 
5, 2011 until November 15, 2011.74 His Axis II diagnosis was always V71.09 (no 
diagnosis).75 His Axis III diagnosis was always deferred.76 His Axis IV diagnosis was 
always job or family/job.77 His Axis V GAF fluctuated between 60 and 67.78 It is 
significant that although Applicant believed the counselor had diagnosed him as alcohol 
dependent,79 there was never any diagnosis by this counselor of alcohol abuse or 
alcohol dependence.

(SOR ¶ 2.g.) As noted above, as part of his February 2011 sentence, Applicant 
was ordered to complete alcohol treatment and counseling as required by law. The DUI 
school referred him to a counseling center and, on August 31, 2011, Applicant was 
admitted into the center’s out-patient program. He was clinically assessed and 
diagnosed, and a treatment plan was established by a psychologist with a Ph.D.80  
 
Applicant’s Axis I diagnosis was adult antisocial behavior, rule out alcohol 
abuse.81 His Axis II diagnosis was V71.09 (no diagnosis).82 His Axis III diagnosis was 
none.83 His Axis IV diagnosis was DUI reduced to reckless.84 His Axis V GAF was 78, 
and it had fluctuated between 69 and 84.85 Applicant received group counseling for one 
hour per session, with up to 13 “clients,” from a counselor who has an MS degree, and 
is an LMHC.86 Between September 2011 and December 2011, Applicant completed 9 of 
the program’s 20 sessions87 before transferring out of the program and into a different 
one because of the difficulties and cost of using public transportation.88 It is significant 
that there was never any diagnosis by this counselor or psychologist of alcohol abuse or 
alcohol dependence. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 2.h. and 2.i.)  Following his disenrollment from that out-patient program, 
and after he completed a church-sponsored team activity in a state tournament, 
Applicant enrolled in a different out-patient program. During the interim, however, 
Applicant injured a finger and, experiencing soreness, swelling, and extreme pain, he 
slipped from his abstinence and consumed about a pint of rum and coke in order to 
sleep.89 He reported the slip to his new counselor.90 An individualized treatment plan 
was established in April 2012, and he was clinically assessed in May 2012. Despite 
Applicant’s belief that his new counselor was a doctor,91 she is not. She has an MS 
degree, and is an LMHC, and a certified addiction professional (CAP).92 The counselor’s

initial diagnostic impression was alcohol dependent.93 No final Axis I diagnosis was 
made. Applicant continued attending AA meetings three times per week,94 and 
completed all of the counseling required by the program. Upon completion of the 
program, he chose to continue with her aftercare group sessions as a support system, 
and continues his aftercare participation.95 While he no longer attends AA meetings, he 
does meet with his AA sponsor/coach every Saturday morning.96 
 
Before contacting the EAP, Applicant’s sobriety date – the date on which he 
started to abstain from consuming alcohol – was April 14, 2011.97 Once he started his 
counseling, Applicant received a prescription for Antabuse, a drug that creates an 
unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol and reduces the desire to drink. 
Unfortunately, once the prescription was exhausted, Applicant believed he could handle 
alcohol on weekends, and he had his first in a series of unreported “relapses” that he 
hid from his counselor. His new sobriety date became August 29, 2011.98 Applicant 
remained sober until he slipped in mid-April 2012.99 His current sobriety date is April 16, 
2012.100 Applicant acknowledges he has a drinking problem, and he has vowed not to 
consume alcohol in the future.101 He conceded he did not “get it right the first time.”102 
Applicant was unable to view his counseling records, so he was not aware of any

 During a group counseling session, Applicant and his current counselor recently discussed the differences 
between a slip and a relapse. The explanation was as follows:  
 
. . . to be considered to be a slip, one would return immediately to the support group and be honest 
about what happened and continue on with the recovery process, trying to understand why it 
happened and how to prevent a repeat. A relapse would be when a person drinks and not only 
does not report it to the support group, but lies about it (most importantly to themselves) and 
CONTINUES to drink, requiring a “lower” rock bottom than the one previously brought them to 
recovery in the first place.

counselor comments. Nevertheless, irrespective of any medical diagnosis, he considers 
himself to be an alcoholic, but not alcohol dependent.103 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 In February 2013, Applicant’s manager noted that Applicant is a team player who 
is always ready and willing to assist, is dependable, competent, and that he consistently 
meets expectations. The performance period from January 2012 until February 2013 
“was decisively [Applicant’s] best performing year thus far.” He also noted that it was a 
“great improvement from previous years.”104 A project manager, who is also a member 
of the church school board of directors, noted that Applicant had volunteered over 400 
hours in the last three and one-half years supporting the promotion of science and 
engineering to the students and serving as the volunteer coach for the robotics club. He 
supports Applicant without hesitation.105  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”106 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”107   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”108 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.109  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”110 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”111 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling $25,675 that had been 
placed for collection, charged off, or purportedly went to repossession. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.112  
                                                          
112
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
16 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) apply, and AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties on and off since 2002 
make it difficult to conclude that those difficulties occurred “so long ago” or were “so 
infrequent.” Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Applicant’s financial problems were, 
to some degree, beyond his control. His former girlfriend gave birth to Applicant’s 
daughter. During parts of 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008, he was essentially unemployed 
or working in part-time jobs. He identified 2007 as a particularly tough time because he 
was not making sufficient income as a self-employed contract trainer to make his 
monthly payments. Once his income increased, he turned his focus to his creditors in an 
effort to identify them and resolve his delinquent accounts.  
Applicant acted responsibly by contacting the creditors and collection agents he 
could identify, by paying off several SOR and non-SOR accounts, and by entering 
repayment agreements with other creditors. There is one account that has caused him 
significant consternation, especially since it pertains to a vehicle which, according to the 
credit reports, was involuntarily repossessed, but which he continued to possess for 
some time after the purported repossession. The dealer is out of business and the 
finance company disavowed ownership of the account. The account is no longer on 
Applicant’s 2013 credit report.  Applicant intends to continue making payments until all 
of the accounts are current. While he has not received any financial counseling or debt 
consolidation services, there are clear indications that his financial problems are being 
resolved and are under control. Applicant has no other delinquent debts. Applicant’s 
actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.113 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out 
in AG & 21:       
 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of 
concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or 
alcohol dependent is potentially disqualifying.  Also, AG ¶ 22(c) may apply where there 
is habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless 
of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. 
Similarly, if there is a diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, AG ¶

17 
                                      
 
22(d) may apply. In addition, under AG ¶ 22(e), it is potentially disqualifying when there 
is an evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social 
worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. Also, where 
there is a relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an 
alcohol rehabilitation program, AG ¶ 22(f) may apply. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) have been established. Appellant’s consumption of 
alcohol, sometimes up to an 18-pack of beer a day, resulted in his periodic impairment 
or intoxication. He was arrested in October 1998 and charged with DWI, and arrested in 
September 2010 and charged with DUI. In 1998, he was ordered to perform community 
service and to attend AA. The 2010 charge was reduced to reckless driving, and he was 
sentenced to perform community service, probation, attend the DUI First Offender 
Program, and to complete alcohol treatment and counseling as required by law. While 
Applicant was also involved in an alcohol-related incident when he was 17 years old, 
that incident occurred when he was a minor, and the charge was dismissed. 
  
AG ¶¶ 22(d) and 22(e) have not been established. Appellant received a 
diagnosis of depression and depression/rule out ADHD from a counselor with an MS, 
LMHC, CPC, and BCPC, in 2011. A later 2011 diagnosis from a different counselor with 
an MS and LMHC, was adult antisocial behavior/rule out alcohol abuse. A subsequent 
2012 initial diagnostic impression, not a final diagnosis, was given by a counselor with 
an MS, LMHC, and CAP. Although there was a psychologist on the staff of the program 
when the initial diagnosis was given, there is no evidence that he ever participated in 
any aspect of the program, especially the diagnosis segment, other than establishing 
the overall program. Therefore, as it pertains to the two 2011 diagnoses, there is no 
evidence of a diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical 
psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. The same is true 
regarding the diagnostic impression. As to the same diagnostic impression, there is no 
evidence to support an “evaluation” of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a 
licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment 
program. There is no evidence to support any potential contention that an MS, LMHC, 
and CAP constitutes or equates to a licensed clinical social worker. Furthermore, while 
there was an initial diagnostic impression of alcohol dependence, there is no evidence 
to support the existence of a final diagnosis.  
 
 AG ¶ 22(f) has not been established. Applicant was in an alcohol program from 
April 2011 until November 2011, but there was no diagnosis of alcohol abuse or 
dependence from that program. He was in another alcohol program from August 2011 
and December 2011, but, once again, there was no diagnosis of alcohol abuse or 
dependence from that program. It is correct that Applicant continued to consume 
alcohol during segments of the programs, but without a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or 
dependence, there cannot be a relapse following a diagnosis. Applicant’s initial sobriety 
date was April 14, 2011. He subsequently slipped and his new sobriety date became 
August 29, 2011. Applicant’s current sobriety date is April 16, 2012, before the date of 
the diagnostic impression. Thus, there is no evidence of a relapse after a diagnostic 
impression of alcohol dependence, much less a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or 
dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.

 The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from alcohol consumption. Under AG ¶ 23(b), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated when the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or 
issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, 
and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if 
an alcohol abuser). Similarly, AG ¶ 23(d) applies where the evidence shows: 
 
the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  
 
 AG ¶¶ 23(b) and 23(d) apply. Appellant has taken full responsibility for his 
actions. He acknowledged that he did not get it right the first time when he continued to 
consume alcohol. He has also acknowledged that he has a drinking problem, and 
considers himself to be an alcoholic. However, considering one’s self to be an alcoholic 
is not the same as being professionally diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent. Applicant has vowed not to consume alcohol in the future. He has 
successfully completed outpatient counseling and has voluntarily entered the aftercare 
program. Applicant has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence, 
and he routinely meets with his AA sponsor/coach. There is no evidence of a 
recommendation for continued counseling, therapy, or follow-up.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
 
19 
                                      
 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.114       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
permitted accounts to become delinquent. As a result, accounts were placed for 
collection or charged off. He consumed alcohol routinely since the eighth grade, and 
over the years, has been involved in three alcohol-related incidents involving police and 
judicial authorities. One day, his management team smelled the odor of stale alcohol on 
him at work. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending on 
his part, and he did not spend beyond his means. Applicant’s financial problems were, 
to some degree, beyond his control. His former girlfriend gave birth to Applicant’s 
daughter. During several years, he was essentially unemployed or working in part-time 
jobs, with 2007 being identified as a particularly tough time because he was not making 
sufficient income as a self-employed contract trainer to make his monthly payments. 
Applicant acted responsibly by contacting the creditors and collection agents he could 
identify, by paying off several SOR and non-SOR accounts, and by entering repayment 
agreements with other creditors. Applicant intends to continue making payments until all 
of the accounts are current. There are clear indications that his financial problems are 
being resolved and are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:115 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may

 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant efforts to resolve his accounts. 
 
 But Applicant’s situation does not consist solely of financial problems, for he also 
has alcohol consumption issues. He routinely consumed alcohol to excess, and 
attended several alcohol programs, and, after some slips, which he referred to as 
relapses, he finally acknowledged that he did not get it right the first time when he 
continued to consume alcohol. Applicant admits that he has a drinking problem, and 
considers himself to be an alcoholic. He has vowed not to consume alcohol in the 
future. Applicant successfully completed outpatient counseling and has voluntarily 
entered the aftercare program. With a current sobriety date of April 16, 2012 – about 20 
months ago – he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence. In 
addition, he meets with his AA sponsor/coach on a weekly basis.  
 
 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations 
and alcohol consumption. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
