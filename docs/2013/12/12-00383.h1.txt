O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for financial 
considerations. Her request for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 17, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant that detailed security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992) as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the allegations under 
Guideline F, and denied the remaining allegations (1.d and 1.e). The case was assigned 
to me on August 27, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
 
 
 
2 
a Notice of Hearing on September 9, 2013, setting the hearing date for September 25, 
2013. At the hearing, I admitted nine Government exhibits into evidence (GE 1-9). 
Applicant testified and presented six exhibits, admitted into evidence as AE A-F. I held 
the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. She timely 
submitted three documents, admitted as AE G-I. DOHA received the transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) on October 2, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough 
review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the evidence, I make 
the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 32 years old. She married in 2006 and has one seven-year-old child. 
She and her husband separated in 2011. Applicant attended college from 2010 to 2011 
but did not receive a degree. She has worked for federal contractors since graduating 
from high school in 2000, and has held a security clearance since that time. She had 
periods of unemployment from September 2009 to February 2010, and from August to 
October 2010. She has been employed full-time for the past three years. She joined her 
current employer in April 2013 and works as the service desk lead at a federal agency. 
(GE 1; Tr. 22-29) 
 
Applicant testified that she and her husband were earning good salaries when 
they married and they were financially stable. In 2010, she was laid off. When her 
husband left the marital home in 2011, she lost the benefit of having two incomes, and 
he “. . . left the debt we both had, for me to pay.” Some of the delinquencies listed in the 
SOR are joint debts. Applicant stated in her interrogatory response that she “. . . made a 
conscious effort to keep up with the delinquencies to the best of [my] abilities. . . ” (GE 
2, 3; Tr. 49-50) 
 
 In about 2006, Applicant and her husband were considering purchasing a home. 
They contacted a debt-consolidation agency to assist them in improving their financial 
situation. Applicant and her husband did not use the service because it required 
monthly payments before it would negotiate settlements with creditors. In 2007, they 
purchased a home for $200,000. It was fully financed, with no down payment, and an 
adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). As payments increased over time, they could no 
longer afford them. Their four requests for loan modifications were denied. Applicant 
provided documentation of her November 2009 request and the lender’s refusal. In 
January 2010, they were notified that foreclosure proceedings had been initiated, and 
they moved from the home. (GE 2, 3; Tr. 50-55, 66) 
 
Applicant's gross annual income is approximately $60,000. The net monthly 
income on her May 2013 personal financial statement (PFS) is $3,508. In May 2013, 
she reported monthly expenses of $2,060. She listed debt payments of $275 per month, 
which included payments on the debts at allegations 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. After deducting 
 
 
3 
her monthly expenses and debt payments, Applicant had a monthly net remainder of 
$1,173. At the hearing, Applicant stated she now shares her rent with a cohabitant, and 
her monthly expenses have dropped approximately $500 to $1,500. (GE 2; Tr. 44-49) 
 
Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on October 7, 2013, about two 
weeks after the hearing. It lists $4,819 in assets and $52,258 in liabilities. She is no 
longer making the debt payments she listed in her PFS because all of her delinquent 
debts are included in the bankruptcy. The petition includes the debts alleged in the SOR 
at ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, and 1.e. The car that secures the smaller delinquent auto loan 
(SOR ¶ 1.g) is listed as exempt in her petition. The bankruptcy petition also lists student 
loans totaling $12,879, which are described as “non-dischargeable” in the petition. The 
student loans are not listed in the SOR. Applicant also owes her bankruptcy attorney 
$1,636. (GE 2; AE F, H; Tr. 31-33, 44-49) 
 
 Applicant's delinquencies appear in credit reports dated March, May, and June 
2013. The SOR alleges debts totaling $229,995, including the following: two auto loans 
totaling $18,590; one mortgage loan with a balance of $204,566; unpaid rent of $2,264; 
a utility bill of $589; and two credit card debts totaling $3,986. The SOR also alleges 
that the lender foreclosed on the delinquent mortgage loan. The status of Applicant's 
SOR debts follows. (GE 2, 4, 5) 
 
Rent/judgment – allegation 1.a, $2,264. Payment Plan. The debt represents one 
month’s rent on the townhome where Applicant and her husband lived before they 
separated in 2011. When her husband left, Applicant could not afford the rent on her 
own. The creditor sued, and the court awarded the creditor a judgment in the amount of 
$2,264 in June 2012. Applicant stated in her Answer that the full balance as of August 
2013 had been $3,165, but she was making $100 monthly payments, and had reduced 
the balance to $2,965. She provided documentation showing payments in June and July 
2013. She testified that she made a third payment, but did not provide documentation. 
(GE 6; AE A; Tr. 30-34) 
 
Utility debt/judgment – allegation 1.b, $589. Payment Plan. The creditor sued 
Applicant in February 2011 for a delinquent electricity bill that was in Applicant and her 
spouse’s names. The court awarded a default judgment to the utility company in May 
2011 for $589 plus $96 court costs. In her September 2011 security interview, Applicant 
stated she had made arrangements to pay $100 per month starting in November 2011. 
However, as of 2013, the debt was still delinquent. In March 2013, Applicant arranged a 
payment plan of $50 per month, to begin April 2013. She testified that she made 
payments in April and May 2013, a half-payment in June 2013, and no payments in July 
or August. (GE 2, 3, 7; AE B, E; Tr. 34-36, 63) 
 
Automobile Loan/judgment - allegation 1.c, $14,846. Payment Plan. In Applicant's 
interrogatory response, she stated that this loan was a joint debt for a car purchased in 
2006. Applicant and her husband were unable to afford the payments. Since 2008, 
when they voluntarily surrendered the car, Applicant had been giving her husband her 
 
 
4 
portion of the car payment and it was his responsibility to make the payment. The 
lender sued Applicant and her husband and was awarded a default judgment in 
December 2008 for $14,846. The lender garnished Applicant's bank account in the 
amount of approximately $600 in March 2013. A July 2013 letter from the creditor 
shows that Applicant and her husband were offered a payoff amount of $5,392. 
Applicant and her husband are paying $175 per month, with Applicant’s share being 
$75 per month. The $75 payments started June 15, 2013. (GE 2, 3, 8; AE C; Tr. 36-38, 
58-62) 
 
Credit cards/judgment - allegation 1.d, $1,282. Disputes; Unresolved. Applicant’s 
credit reports show that she had two low-limit credit cards in her name from this lender, 
opened in early 2012, totaling $1,282. (GE 4, 5) Applicant testified that she was never 
contacted by the creditor about this debt. The creditor filed suit, and a hearing was held 
in June 2013, where the creditor was awarded a default judgment. She contacted the 
creditor in July 2013 by telephone to state that she disputes owing the debt, but she 
has not received any further information. She did not contact the credit agencies to 
dispute the debt. (GE 9; Tr. 38-40, 64-65) 
 
Credit card – allegation 1.e, $2,704. Disputes; Unresolved. Applicant’s credit report 
shows this is an individual account. She disputes owing the balance because she 
believes the account is closed, based on her May 2013 credit report. She called the 
creditor in July 2013 to dispute the debt. She did not contact the credit agencies to 
dispute the debt.  Her credit report shows the account is closed because the creditor 
has charged it off as an uncollectible bad debt. The debt is not resolved. (GE 2; Tr. 39-
40, 64-65) 
 
Mortgage - allegation 1.f, $204,566. Disputes; Foreclosed. Applicant’s marital home 
was foreclosed in 2010. She stated in her August 2013 Answer that she had contacted 
the lender but had not received information on any remaining liability for the debt. She 
received a December 2010 Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-A, which listed the 
loan balance of $204,566, and a fair market value of $103,000. It also notes that the 
borrower was “personally liable for repayment of the debt.” She provided a website 
printout showing that the home was listed as sold in August 2010 for $122,750. As of 
the August hearing, Applicant did not know if she was liable for a deficiency. (GE 3; AE 
D, I; Tr. 40-43) 
 
Automobile loan – allegation 1.g, $3,744. Payment Plan. Applicant and her husband 
bought a car. After an accident, the car was a total loss. The alleged amount is their 
remaining liability after the insurance payout. Applicant testified that the creditor 
contacted her husband in August 2013 and that he is making arrangements to pay the 
debt. (Tr. 43-44)

Policies 
 
Each security clearance decision must be a fair and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, 
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.1 Decisions 
must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, 
commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept.  The presence or absence of a 
disqualifying or mitigating condition does not determine a conclusion for or against an 
applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines are followed whenever a case can 
be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or 
denial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the 
information presented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and 
adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations).   
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest2 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial 
burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets 
its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government’s 
case. Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy 
burden of persuasion.3 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, 
the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national 
interests as her or his own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in 
favor of the Government.4 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
AG ¶18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
                                                 
1 Directive. 6.3. 
2 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).

unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially over-
extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . 
 
 Applicant has had difficulty meeting her financial obligations for the past several 
years. The SOR debts, not including her mortgage balance of $204,566, is $25,429. 
Her debts started in about 2008, before she and her husband separated in 2011, and 
continue to the present. The following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶19 apply: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 The financial considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate 
security concerns. I have considered the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 20, especially 
the following: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
Applicant's debts are recent, because they are currently delinquent. Applicant 
has not demonstrated a consistent willingness to resolve them over the past several 
years, despite apparently having a monthly remainder sufficient to support payments. I 
cannot conclude that delinquencies will not recur. Her conduct does not support a 
finding of current reliability or good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 Applicant may have had little control over several events that affected her 
finances. Most significant was her separation, which caused a reduction in her income. 
She was also unemployed for several months in the 2009 to 2010 period. In addition, 
 
 
7 
the record does not indicate that Applicant receives child support from her husband. It 
also appears that her husband is contributing to payment of only two of the five joint 
debts in the SOR. Applicant could not predict these events, and they had a negative 
effect on her ability to pay her debts. However, some of her debts became delinquent 
before her husband left in 2011, including the automobile loan in 2008 and her 
mortgage in 2010. In addition, some financial problems appear to have stemmed from 
factors within her control. Applicant bought a home with 100 percent financing. She 
also agreed to finance the mortgage with an ARM, which predictably increased her 
payments over time. Applicant made some efforts to resolve her delinquent mortgage 
by seeking loan modifications from the lenders. AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part.  
 
 In about 2006, Applicant contacted a debt-consolidation company, but did not 
use their services. Since then, her efforts to pay her delinquent debts have been 
inconsistent. Between 2008 and 2011, four creditors were awarded judgments. During 
her security interview in 2011, she promised to begin a payment plan on the debt at 
allegation 1.b, but the debt was still delinquent two years later when SOR was issued. 
After receiving the DOHA interrogatories in May 2013, she again said she would 
resolve her debts through payment plans, which she initiated within the three months 
before the hearing. She recently retained an attorney, who filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
petition two weeks after the hearing. Applicant's inconsistent efforts do not demonstrate 
a good-faith effort over the past several years. The bankruptcy petition has not been 
discharged, and her debts are not yet resolved. Applicant receives some mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(c) for this attempt to resolve her debts, but no mitigation under AG ¶ 
20(d). 
 
Whole-Person Analysis   
  
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and all 
the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must 
be an commonsense judgment based upon consideration of the guidelines and the 
whole-person concept. Under the cited guideline, I considered the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  
 
 
8 
 Applicant has been working full-time since 2010. Since at least 2011, when she 
completed her security clearance application, she has been on notice that her financial 
status is a security concern. Her debts owed to several creditors were delinquent to the 
point that the creditors were forced to pursue court action, resulting in four judgments 
against her. Another creditor garnished her bank account. During her 2011 security 
interview, Applicant promised to resolve a debt through a payment plan, but did not 
follow through. Two years later, her delinquencies remained. Applicant may continue to 
be financially indebted, because despite filing for Chapter 7 bank protection, she will 
owe $1,636 to her attorney and $12,879 in non-dischargeable student loans.  
 
 Under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence, an applicant must show that she has a 
viable plan in place and has taken steps to implement that plan. Applicant’s Chapter 7 
bankruptcy is a legitimate avenue to resolve debts. However, this appears to be an 
eleventh-hour effort in response to the security clearance process. Applicant's sporadic 
efforts over the past several years, despite apparently having a sufficient monthly 
remainder, do not show a commitment to meeting her financial obligations, and fail to 
demonstrate reliability and good judgment.  
 
 The doubts raised about Applicant’s suitability for a security clearance remain. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns 
raised by the cited adjudicative guideline.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to 
classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.
