Decision 
__________ 
 
Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
From 1983 to May 2009, Applicant was charged and convicted six times of 
driving while intoxicated (DWI), driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), or refusal to 
take a breathalyzer test (BAT). In 2010 and 2012, he was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent. He is currently on conditions of bail pending adjudication of his appeal on 
his most recent DUI conviction. After his most recent DUI, he made some very positive 
changes in his life. On December 31, 2009, he ended his alcohol consumption; in 
January 2010, he completed a 10-day inpatient alcohol treatment program (IATP); and 
he receives support from friends and the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA). 
Nevertheless, more time without alcohol consumption and criminal conduct is necessary 
before security concerns will be fully mitigated. Alcohol consumption and criminal 
conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
revoked. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 12, 2011, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On September 28, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) the President promulgated on 
December 29, 2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) 
and J (criminal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR further informed Applicant 
that DOD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance, 
and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a 
determination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
(HE 2)  
 
On November 5, 2012, the DOD Hearings and the Appeals Office received 
Applicant’s response to the SOR. (HE 3) Applicant requested a hearing. On December 
7, 2012, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. 
On December 13, 2012, Applicant’s case was assigned to another administrative judge. 
On January 8, 2013, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for January 23, 
2013. (HE 1A) On February 4, 2013, DOHA issued a new hearing notice, setting the 
hearing for February 27, 2013. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled using video 
teleconference on February 27, 2013. (HE 1B) Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits, 
and Applicant offered 18 exhibits. (Tr. 15-25; GE 1-11; AE A-R) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-11 and AE A-R. (Tr. 16, 25) Additionally, I admitted the 
hearing notice, SOR, Applicant’s response to the SOR, ISCR Case No. 10-11030 (A.J. 
Dec. 31, 2012); ISCR Case No. 10-03933 (A.J. Dec. 10, 2012); and ISCR Case No. 11-
02078 (A.J. Nov. 9, 2012). (HE 1A, 1B, 2-6) On March 7, 2013, I received the transcript. 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Applicant’s counsel contended that ISCR Case No. 10-11030 (A.J. Dec. 31, 
2012); ISCR Case No. 10-03933 (A.J. Dec. 10, 2012); and ISCR Case No. 11-02078 
(A.J. Nov. 9, 2012) provided persuasive examples of mitigation of alcohol consumption 
security concerns similar to Applicant’s case. (Tr. 15, 103-104; HE 4-6) Those decisions 
will be discussed in the analysis section of this decision.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f, and he provided 
some extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make 
the following additional findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked in 
logistics on a military installation for the last two years. (Tr. 27, 80) He drives 
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or 
locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific 
information.

distinguished visitors, fuel, parts, or garbage. (Tr. 86) He may be unable to retain his 
employment if his driver’s license is downgraded to a restricted driver’s license. (Tr. 89) 
He married in 1998, and he was divorced in 2008. (GE 1) He does not have any 
children. (GE 1)  
  
Criminal offenses and alcohol consumption 
 
 In March 1983, Applicant was charged with DWI and refusal to take a BAT. (SOR 
¶ 1.k) He was convicted of refusal to take a BAT. (SOR ¶ 1.f) He was sentenced to a 
fine and 72 hours of community service. 
 
In September 1986, Applicant was charged with DWI and misconduct involving 
weapons. (SOR ¶ 1.e) He pleaded no contest, was found guilty, and sentenced to 90 
days in jail (suspended), and fined $500. (SOR ¶ 1.e)  
 
In October 1988, Applicant was charged with DWI, refusal to take a breathalyzer 
test, and driving a vehicle while his driver’s license was revoked. (Tr. 75-76; SOR ¶ 1.d) 
He was convicted and sentenced to fines and fees of about $2,500. (SOR ¶ 1.d)  
 
In April 1996, Applicant was charged with DWI. (SOR ¶ 1.c) In June 1996, he 
was convicted and sentenced to fines and fees of about $500. (SOR ¶ 1.c)  
 
In October 2004, Applicant was charged with DUI. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He was 
convicted; his driver’s license was revoked for one year; he was fined $4,000; jailed for 
365 days (335 days suspended); and placed on probation for five years. (SOR ¶ 1.b) In 
May 2009, as a result of a DUI charge, a petition to revoke his probation was filed. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b)  
 
On May 30, 2009, Applicant was charged with DUI. (SOR ¶ 1.a) His BAC using a 
breathalyzer was .116. (Tr. 46; AE K at 1) He requested a blood test and the result was 
.113. (Tr. 58) He pleaded not guilty. (Tr. 52) On August 25, 2011, he was convicted after 
a bench trial and sentenced to jail for 365 days (182 days suspended), placed on 
probation for five years, and fined $4,000. (Tr. 52-53; SOR ¶ 1.a; AE K at 1) He was 
also required to pay $2,000 as the cost of confinement as well as some other fees. (AE 
K at 2) Payment of the fine is due in five years. (AE K at 1) His driver’s license was 
revoked for four years, effective September 23, 2011. (AE K at 1)  
 
After Applicant regains his driving privileges, he must use an interlock device for 
18 months. (AE K at 2) He is not permitted to possess or consume alcohol for five years 
from August 25, 2011. (AE K at 2) On September 13, 2011, Applicant filed an appeal. 
(Tr. 47; AE L) On September 23, 2011, he received a temporary probation order, which 
required him not to consume alcohol, obey laws, and maintain an interlock device on his 
vehicle. (Tr. 48-49, 53-54; AE M) He is not currently on probation; however, his legal 
status because of his appeal is that he is under conditions of bail. (Tr. 54-56) Applicant 
expected the appeal would not be decided for six months or so. (Tr. 49) The action 
suspending his driver’s license was stayed. (Tr. 53) Applicant’s status is that he is 
convicted of DUI. (Tr. 59)

Should Applicant’s appeal be denied, he will lose his employment because his 
driver’s license will be revoked and holding a driver’s license is a condition of his 
employment. (Tr. 87) When his driver’s license is reinstated, he will have an opportunity 
to apply to return to his employment. (Tr. 88) 
 
Alcohol counseling and treatment 
 
From January 3-13, 2010, Applicant attended an inpatient alcohol treatment 
program (IATP) in a different state than his state of residence. (Tr. 28; SOR ¶ 1.g; AE A) 
Applicant tried Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and a counseling service. (Tr. 29) He 
described it as “a very successful program,” “the best decision I ever made,” and “a 
miracle.” (Tr. 28, 30) The IATP involved aversion therapy and reinforcement techniques 
to reset Applicant’s brain so that his alcohol desire was reduced to zero. (Tr. 30-31, 67) 
He was exposed to his “preferred alcohol mixed with Ipecac to condition a nausea and 
vomiting response.” (AE H at 1) Treatment included “hypnotism and sodium pentothal 
influenced interviews to emphasize the positive aspects of eliminating alcohol from [his] 
life.” (AE H at 1) The IATP diagnosis was alcohol dependence,2 and the IATP clinic 
recommended that he maintain regular contact with IATP, develop sober activities, and 
completely abstain from alcohol consumption. (GE 2 at 120; SOR ¶ 1.g) The IATP 
enrolled him in two-year aftercare program that consists of “call-in meetings,” and he 
can return to IATP, as necessary, for refresher treatment. (Tr. 31-32, 67) The IATP also 
provides a support system for him. (Tr. 70) 
 
On August 7, 2012, at DOHA’s request, Applicant obtained an updated 
psychiatric examination. (Tr. 40; AE H) The report indicates “documentation of DUIs in 
May 2009, October 2004, 1998, 1988, 1983, and 1976.”3 (AE H at 1) Applicant advised 
that he has “a history of drinking in a binge type fashion.” (AE H at 1) He admitted that 
alcohol contributed to legal, financial, and relationship problems. (AE H at 1) He had 
blackouts, but not delirium tremens. (AE H at 2) Prior to 2010, he had been able to 
discontinue alcohol consumption for months at a time; however, he reported that his 
most recent alcohol consumption was about 30 months ago on December 31, 2009, 
                                            
2 The IATP diagnosis did not include the qualifications of the person providing the diagnosis. 
 
3 There was no alcohol-related offense in 1976. In September 1975, Applicant was arrested for 
possession of marijuana, and in July 1980, he was arrested and convicted of disorderly conduct.  (GE 4) 
His marijuana possession offense and his disorderly conduct offense were not included in the SOR. In 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). His marijuana possession offense and his disorderly conduct offense are not considered 
for any purpose because the circumstances surrounding these two offenses were not well developed at 
the hearing.

which was prior to attendance at the IATP in January 2010. (Tr. 68, 101; AE H at 2) The 
report concludes, “While we do not have objective evidence of his maintaining 
abstinence for the last 2 ½ years, his lack of continued offenses in that time, and his 
current presentation suggests his reporting is accurate.” (AE H at 3) Under Axis I he 
was diagnosed with “Alcohol Dependence in full remission by patient’s report.” (AE H at 
3; SOR ¶ 1.h) A psychiatrist signed the report. (AE H at 4) The report recommended 
continued abstinence and consultation with IATP as necessary. (AE H at 4) Applicant 
concurred with the accuracy of this report. (Tr. 41-42) 
 
 A licensed professional and family counselor interviewed Applicant on November 
1 and 6, 2012, and thereafter observed him at regularly attended “supportive outpatient 
counseling.” (AE I) She described him as not “engaged in behaviors consistent with 
alcohol abuse or dependence” for the last three years based on his self-reports. He did 
not commit alcohol-related criminal events since 2009. She diagnosed him with alcohol 
dependence “in Full Remission.” (Tr. 43-44; AE I) 
 
 Applicant attended some AA meetings in the 1980s, around 1999, 2004, and 
2005. (Tr. 63) He did not attend any AA meetings after January 2010. (Tr. 64) The AA 
program did not work for Applicant. (Tr. 72-73) He attended a 40-hour outpatient 
alcohol-counseling program in 2004 or 2005. (Tr. 63-64)  He received some counseling 
at the VA Center. (Tr. 32, 65) Applicant’s friends provide a support system. (Tr. 32) 
Applicant’s father visits with Applicant on a weekly basis, and he has not seen Applicant 
drink alcohol after January 2010. (Tr. 93-95)  
 
Applicant does not have the desire, need, or intention to ever consume alcohol. 
(Tr. 28) He describes himself previously as a “social drinker.” (Tr. 28, 69) Now, he views 
himself as a “non-drinker,” and he denies that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 28, 69) He does 
not believe it is necessary to avoid locations or social events where alcohol is served. 
(Tr. 68) About a month before his hearing, he was in a bar drinking soda. (Tr. 68) He 
has never permitted his alcohol use to adversely affect his employment. (Tr. 29) He 
promised to maintain his sobriety and remain alcohol free. (Tr. 50-51, 70-71, 74, 77) 
 
Character evidence 
 
 An Air Force lieutenant colonel (Lt. Col.) has known Applicant through his 
employment and socially for two years. (Tr. 33; AE B) The Lt. Col. was aware of 
Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption and therapy. (Tr. 33-34) On January 13, 
2013, he said Applicant “has always been professional and his work ethic has never 
come into question. I recommend [him for] a secret clearance.” (AE B)    
 
 Three of Applicant’s supervisors at his current employment described him as 
dependable, professional, loyal, trustworthy, and courteous. (Tr. 35-36, 80-86; AE C, D) 
He volunteers for extra work. (Tr. 82) His work performance is outstanding. (AE C) 
None of them described smelling alcohol on his breath or indicated his alcohol 
consumption adversely affected his employment. (Tr. 88; AE C, D)

 On January 16, 2013, Applicant’s supervisor at his previous employment wrote 
that he has worked closely with him for six years and has known him since 1999. (Tr. 
36-37; AE E) He described Applicant as a highly-skilled and valued employee with 
integrity and mature judgment. (AE E) Another coworker and friend, who worked closely 
with Applicant for four years and has known Applicant since 1996, described applicant 
as professional, knowledgeable, and ethical. (Tr. 37-38; AE F) He is generous and 
helpful to a society. (AE F) 
 
 A good friend of Applicant’s, who has known him for 20 years and was married to 
him for nine years, states he has been sober now for three years. (Tr. 38; AE G) 
Applicant’s alcohol abuse damaged their marriage, and he became sober after their 
divorce. (Tr. 39) He has a better relationship with her now than at times during their 
marriage. (Tr. 39-40) His former spouse describes him as a diligent and trustworthy 
worker and a great asset to his company. (Tr. 38; AE G) 
 
 Applicant was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation for his Army service from 
December 3, 1971 to June 4, 1973. (AE J) The certificate was signed by Commander In 
Chief Richard Nixon. The certificate lauds his honorable service, devotion to duty, and 
spirit of sacrifice as well as his contributions to the national defense. (AE J) Applicant 
served in Vietnam as an infantry soldier primarily performing duties as a radio telephone 
operator or RTO. (Tr. 44-45) He was entrusted with classified RTO passwords and 
codes in Vietnam. (Tr. 45-46) 
 
Applicant honorably served in the infantry in Vietnam and earned the National 
Defense Service Medal (NDSM), Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with 60 device 
(RVNCM w/60 DEV), Good Conduct Medal (GCM), Bronze Star Medal (BSM), Vietnam 
Service Medal (VSM) with One Bronze Service Star, and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry 
Cross with Palm Unit Citation Badge as well as various weapons qualification badges. 
(GE 2 at 121-22) 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse 
clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Nothing in this decision 
should be construed to suggest that I based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.”

  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b), 22(e), 22(f), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not have any 
alcohol-related incidents at work, did not violate any court orders, and did not have a 
relapse after a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. The credentials of the person 
diagnosing Applicant with “alcohol dependence” from IATP are not part of the record. 
His evaluation of alcohol dependence by IATP may not have been by a duly qualified 
medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.   
 
Applicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired 
judgment on some of the occasions when he was arrested.4 His excessive alcohol 
                                            
4Although the term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Directive, the generally accepted 
definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two hours.
 
The 
definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services,

consumption resulted in arrests, convictions, and various penalties imposed by the 
courts. On August 7, 2012, a psychiatrist diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. AG ¶ 
22(a), 22(c), and 22(d) apply.  
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-23(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
AG ¶ 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) apply in part. Applicant completed the 10-day IATP. 
He has not attended any intensive, inpatient alcohol rehabilitation or counseling 
program for more than three years. He has been 100 percent sober since December 31, 
2009. He receives support from family and friends.  
Applicant had three alcohol-related arrests and convictions in the 1980s as 
indicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.f. Those three alcohol-related incidents are too temporally 
remote to have significant security significance other than to show his lengthy history of 
alcohol-related driving infractions. The qualifications of the person, providing the 
alcohol-dependence diagnosis on behalf of IATP in 2010, are not part of the record. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.g are mitigated.  
Even though he has a lengthy history of alcohol consumption, which resulted in 
six arrests, enough time has elapsed in sustained abstinence to partially establish his

alcohol consumption is under control; however, his alcohol consumption continues to 
cast doubt on Applicant’s “current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
AG ¶ 23(c) partially applies. Applicant described some alcohol-related counseling 
in the 1980s, 1990s, 2004, and 2005, as well as attendance at some AA meetings; 
however, the details of those counseling sessions were not provided. He currently has 
contact with IATP and a VA counselor for ongoing support.    
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of 
substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless 
there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR 
Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  For 
example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant 
continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge’s 
application of MC 3.”   
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board 
reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB 
had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most recent DUI was in 
2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol 
(not to intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued 
alcohol consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary 
and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) 
(involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and 
reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
Applicant provided three recent illustrative alcohol-related cases where 
administrative judges granted access to classified information for those applicants. See 
ISCR Case No. 10-11030 (A.J. Dec. 31, 2012); ISCR Case No. 10-03933 (A.J. Dec. 10, 
2012); ISCR Case No. 11-02078 (A.J. Nov. 9, 2012). These three cases provide 
persuasive, non-binding discussions of facts and law.    
 
In ISCR Case No. 10-11030 (A.J. Dec. 31, 2012), the applicant was terminated 
from employment in late 2009 because of his alcohol consumption, and he had a history 
of multiple alcohol-related treatments and relapses. Id. at 2-4. He did not have any 
alcohol-related arrests. Id. He completed 34 months of sobriety, except for one occasion 
where he had one “swig” of alcohol. Id. at 4. He attends two to five AA meetings each 
week. Id.  
 
In ISCR Case No. 10-03933 (A.J. Dec. 10, 2012), the applicant was arrested 
repeatedly from 2001 to 2007, and in June 2009, he was convicted of driving while 
privileges were suspended or revoked and placed on three years of probation. Id. at 2-
 
11 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3. He was convicted of DUI twice and public intoxication twice from August 2004 to 
September 2007. Id. He described minimal alcohol-related treatment and counseling; 
however, his most recent alcohol consumption was in September 2008, more than four 
years before his hearing. His probation was completed before his hearing. Id. at 3-4.  
 
In ISCR Case No. 11-02078 (A.J. Nov. 9, 2012), the applicant had DUI arrests in 
2009 and March 2010. Id. at 2. The court ordered “five years informal probation,” and 
his employer placed him on administrative leave because he had an alcohol-related 
vehicle accident at work. Id. at 2. He completed 32 months of sobriety and six months of 
alcohol-related treatment for six months. Id. He continued to be “heavily involved in AA,” 
has an extensive support group, is involved in an alcohol-related employee assistance 
program, and engages in alumni activities at an alcohol treatment facility. Id. 
 
After careful consideration of the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption, and the cases provided by Applicant, I conclude his successful 
completion of an intensive inpatient alcohol counseling and treatment program and his 
abstinence from alcohol consumption since December 31, 2009, is not sufficient to 
completely resolve my doubts about Applicant’s alcohol consumption and to fully 
mitigate security concerns under Guideline G.      
 
Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, “Criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its 
very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, 
rules and regulations.” 
 
AG ¶ 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may 
be disqualifying in this case, “(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,” “(c) 
allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,” and “(d) individual is currently on 
parole or probation.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(c) apply. From March 1983 to May 30, 2009, Applicant was 
arrested six times for alcohol-related offenses, such as DWI, DUI, or refusal to take a 
BAT. Five offenses resulted in convictions, fines, and other penalties. The sixth offense 
resulted in a conviction, and it is on appeal. I find that he committed the May 2009 DWI 
offense based on his BAT results being over .10. AG ¶ 31(d) does not apply because he 
is not currently on probation. He is under a lesser type of supervision called conditions 
of bail, and he is driving with an interlock device on his vehicle.  
  
AG ¶ 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those 
pressures are no longer present in the person's life; 
 
(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited 
to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or 
restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or 
constructive community involvement. 
 
Although none of the mitigating conditions fully apply, there are important 
mitigating factors. The most recent offense occurred on May 30, 2009, and is not 
particularly recent. He complied with all the terms of his most recent probation. He has 
been continuously employed for two years. He expressed regret and remorse 
concerning his alcohol-related offenses. 
Three of Applicant’s six alcohol-related arrests and convictions were in the 1980s 
as indicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.f. Those three alcohol-related criminal offenses are too 
temporally remote to have significant security significance other than to show his 
lengthy history of alcohol-related driving crimes. SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.f are mitigated as they 
relate to SOR ¶ 2.a.  
Significant factors weighing against mitigating criminal conduct concerns remain. 
He will remain on conditions of bail, and if his appeal is unsuccessful, he will be on 
probation for several years. The state has determined that the passage of more time 
under the limitations of bail or probation and without any criminal misconduct is 
necessary to protect society and establish rehabilitation. More time must elapse before 
there is enough assurance that criminal conduct and other behavior raising security 
concerns is unlikely to recur. Applicant is not ready to be entrusted with access to 
classified information at this time.  
 
Whole Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
13 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under 
Guidelines G and J are incorporated into my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
There is considerable evidence supporting continuation of Applicant’s access to 
classified information. Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who 
has worked in logistics on a military installation for the last two years. Applicant 
honorably served in the infantry in Vietnam and earned the NDSM, RVNCM w/60 DEV, 
GCM, BSM, VSM with One Bronze Service Star, and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry 
Cross with Palm Unit Citation Badge as well as various weapons qualification badges. 
He did not consume alcohol at work. He attended IATP for 10 days in 2010.  He 
abstained from alcohol consumption since December 31, 2009. His former spouse and 
father attest to his abstinence from alcohol consumption for more than three years.   His 
family, friends, coworkers, and supervisors are very supportive of Applicant’s 
rehabilitative efforts. They describe him as dependable, professional, loyal, trustworthy, 
courteous, generous, diligent, productive, and as a highly-skilled and valued employee 
with integrity, skills, and mature judgment. He intends to continue to abstain from 
alcohol consumption, and to seek help from IATP and his VA counselor if necessary. 
There is no evidence at his current employment of any disciplinary problems. There is 
no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security.   
 
The evidence supporting revocation of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial 
than the evidence supporting continuation of his security clearance. From 1983 to May 
2009, Applicant was charged and convicted six times of DWI, DUI, or refusal to take a 
BAT. The offenses in the 1980s have minimal whole-person security significance 
because they were so long ago. He is currently on conditions of bail pending 
adjudication of his appeal on his most recent DUI conviction. Even though his May 2009 
DUI is on appeal, I find that he committed the DUI as he had a BAT and blood test that 
were both above .10, which is above the lawful level of blood-alcohol content for a 
driver. Moreover, each and every time he drove while impaired or intoxicated is a 
serious criminal offense in which he endangered himself and others. Excessive alcohol 
consumption followed by driving a motor vehicle shows a lack of judgment, 
rehabilitation, and impulse control. “By its very nature, [criminal conduct] calls into 
question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.” 
(AG ¶ 30) Alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns are not mitigated. More 
time without any alcohol-related criminal offenses must elapse to fully mitigate security 
concerns.  
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude continuation of Applicant’s 
access to classified information is not warranted at this time.    
 
14 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d to 1.g:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant’s security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is revoked.
