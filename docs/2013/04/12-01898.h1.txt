FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 19, 2011. 
On December 4, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 
2006.  
  
 Applicant received the SOR on December 13, 2012; answered it on December 
31, 2012; and requested a determination on the record without a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government’s written case on January 23, 2013. On January 23, 
2013, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, 
 
 2
who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, 
or mitigate the Government’s evidence. His response was due on February 27, 2013. 
He received the FORM on January 28, 2013, and he responded on March 25, 2013, 
and submitted additional evidence. Department Counsel did not object to his untimely 
submission. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2013.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His 
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 37-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since 
June 2010. He has worked as a security officer for various employers since January 
2001, including federal contractors from May 2004 to May 2010, frequently working for 
more than one employer at a time. He has held a security clearance since August 2008. 
 
 Applicant is unmarried and has no children. He was born in a foreign country and 
became a U.S. citizen in July 2005. His parents are deceased. He has eight living 
siblings. One is a medical doctor, one is a lawyer, one owns a cleaning business, one is 
a teacher, one is an artist, two are pastors, and one is an engineer. (Item 7 at 5.) He 
attended a community college from January 2000 to May 2003 and received an 
associate’s degree. (Item 4 at 13.) 
 
 In June 2004, Applicant left a job by mutual agreement, after he asked for a 
different duty post because he had a fractured ankle that made it painful to stand. 
According to Applicant, his supervisor told him that he should find another job if he 
could not perform the duties that were assigned to him. In May 2010, Applicant was laid 
off from one of his jobs after failing to qualify with his weapon. In June 2010, he was 
fired by one of his employers after he was observed dozing while on duty. In his SCA, 
he explained that he was drowsy because of a medication he had taken. He held a 
second full-time job with another federal contractor from January 2011 until May 2012, 
when he was terminated because he “didn’t have the suitability to work where [he] was 
assigned.” (Item 4 at 17-23; Item 8 at 1.) He is still a full-time employee of the federal 
contractor who is sponsoring him for a clearance. 
 
In a personal subject interview (PSI) in October 2011, Applicant told the 
investigator that his loss of one of his jobs in June 2010 cut his income in half for about 
six months, causing him to fall behind on his debt payments. He told the investigator 
that he had resolved a $12,000 credit card debt for $2,000 in October 2010; resolved a 
$27,750 credit card debt for $9,700 in July 2011 by paying $7,000 and agreeing to 
make $300 payments for nine months; resolved a third $10,532 credit card debt in 
November 2010; and resolved a $3,695 debt to an electronics store in July 2011. (Item 
7 at 6-8.) His credit bureau report dated August 24, 2012, corroborates settlement of the 
three credit card accounts, but it reflects that the debt to the electronics store has not 
been resolved. (Item 5 at 1-2.) None of these debts were alleged in the SOR.  
 
 
 3
 In November 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) 
reflecting net income of $2,300; expenses of $1,911; and debt payments of about $717, 
resulting in a net shortfall of about $326. The debt payments include the three debts 
alleged in the SOR, a $132 payment on a student loan, a $150 payment to the Internal 
Revenue Service, and a $300 payment to a check-cashing service. (Item 8 at 6-7.) The 
debt payments reflected on his PFS are the amounts due, not the amounts actually 
paid. 
 
 Applicant pays rent but has no house payments or car payments. He recently 
sold his car for about $10,000 to pay his debts. His parents are deceased, and his 
siblings appear to be well-educated and self-supporting. In his PFS, he listed a $9,700 
deposit into a “personal business account,” but he did not provide any details about a 
personal business. 
 
 The evidence concerning the three delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is 
summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (debt consolidation loan from credit union, charged off for 
$27,690). Applicant’s PFS indicates that he is obligated to make payments of $500 per 
month on this debt. In his PSI, he told the investigator that he made payments of $600 
per month from 2008 to 2010, and that he submitted a “hardship letter” to the creditor in 
April 2010. (Item 7 at 7.) He submitted evidence of $100 payments in July 2012 and 
September 2012. (Item 8 and 17-18.) In his response to the FORM, he submitted 
evidence of a $270 payment in March 2013. (Response at 8.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c (two personal loans for tuition and rent, charged off for 
a total $16,555). Applicant’s PFS reflects an obligation to make monthly payments 
totaling $300 on these debts. In his PSI, he told the investigator that he had a verbal 
agreement with the creditor to pay whatever he could. (Item 7 at 7.) He submitted 
evidence of payments of $25 and $50 in July 2012, payments of $25 and $50 in August 
2012, and payments of $25 and $50 in September 2012. (Item 8 at 11-16.) In his 
response to the FORM, he submitted evidence of payments of $150 and $100 in March 
2013. His balances on the two accounts were $8,016 and $5,229 as of February 2013. 
(Response at 3-8.) 
 
 In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he refers to unspecified medical problems 
and his need for medications that have interfered with his ability to pay his debts, but he 
provided no details. (Response at 2.) His reference to medications in his response to 
the FORM is consistent with his explanation for sleeping on duty in June 2010.  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
 
 4
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
 
 5
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
 The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $44,245. The concern 
under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially 
applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 Applicant’s credit bureau report, admissions in response to the SOR, statements 
during the PSI, and responses to interrogatories establish all three disqualifying 
conditions. He has a history of long-standing indebtedness that far exceeds his income. 
He has not explained how he accumulated the $54,000 in debts that he resolved before 
the SOR was issued and the $44,245 in unresolved debts alleged in the SOR. He has 
no financial responsibilities to anyone other than himself, and he has not explained why 
he has been unable to keep up with his financial obligations even though he has been 
employed continuously for more than 12 years.  
 
 AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file federal or state tax returns) is not established. Although 
Applicant is indebted to the IRS, there is no evidence that this indebtedness is the result 
of failing to file income tax returns as required.  
 
 6
 Security concerns based on financial considerations may be mitigated by any of 
the following conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
 
AG ¶ 20(f): the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
unresolved, and not the result of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. In 
addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, he accumulated almost $54,000 in delinquent 
debts that were not resolved until 2011.1 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. It is not clear whether Applicant’s termination 
related to a fractured ankle in December 2006 was a circumstance beyond his control. 
He presented no evidence regarding the circumstances of his injury or its severity. It is 
not clear whether Applicant’s loss of employment in May 2010 due to his failure to 
qualify with his weapon was caused by his ineptitude as a marksman, which would be a 
condition beyond his control, or whether it was due to his failure to maintain proficiency 
or failure to participate in qualification firing. He attributed his most recent loss of 
employment in May 2012 to not having “the suitability to work where [he] was assigned,” 
                                                          
1 Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide 
whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, 
or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; 
or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations 
omitted). I have considered the evidence of debts not alleged in the SOR for these limited purposes. 
 
 
 7
with no further explanation. I conclude that Applicant has not carried his burden of 
showing conditions beyond his control.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. There is no evidence that Applicant has sought or 
received financial counseling. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not fully established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance 
adjudication is aimed at evaluating an individual’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution 
of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative 
guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts 
simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 Applicant receives some credit for resolving several delinquent debts that were 
not alleged in the SOR. He is making payments on the debts in the SOR, but those 
payments have been intermittent and for less than the amounts due. He has not 
explained why he has not adhered to his payment plans for the three debts alleged in 
the SOR even though he still has a full-time job.  
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(e) and (f) are not relevant. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts 
alleged in the SOR, and there is no evidence of unexplained affluence. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
 8
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 In spite of working two jobs for many years, Applicant has amassed considerable 
delinquent debt. He has not explained how he accumulated so much debt. He has 
made vague references to medical problems, but provided no details. He has made 
references to “personal business” but provided no details. Based on the limited 
evidence in the record, it appears that Applicant has consistently lived beyond his 
means and has not established a track record of timely and consistent payment of his 
obligations. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
