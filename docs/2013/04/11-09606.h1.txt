Decision
______________
CEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing
(e-QIP) on February 8, 2011.  On September 26, 2012, the Department of Defense
(DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under
Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the
adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense after
September 1, 2006.
 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 17, 2012, and requested an
Administrative Determination by an administrative judge.  Department Counsel issued a
File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 14, 2013.  Applicant failed to respond to
the FORM.  Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.

Findings of Fact
In her Answer to the SOR, dated October 17, 2012, Applicant admitted all the
factual allegations in the Paragraphs of the SOR, without explanations.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant has been gainfully employed since April of 2002.  (Item 5 at pages
16~18.)  The SOR alleges nine past-due debts, all of which are supported by fairly
recent credit reports, the last one of which is from January of 2013.  (Items 7~9.)
1.a.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor A in the amount of about $1,646.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard.
I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.b.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor B in the amount of about $2,558.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She also admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this
regard.  I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.c.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor C in the amount of about $155.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She again admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this
regard.  I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.d.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor D in the amount of about $374.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard.
I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.e.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor E in the amount of about $850.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard.
I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.f.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor F in the amount of about $220.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard.
I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.g.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor G in the amount of about $120.  (Item 7 at
page 1.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard.
I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.h.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor H in the amount of about $7,917.  (Item 8
at page 1.)  She admits this past-due debt, but has submitted nothing further in this
regard.  I find that this debt remains unpaid.
1.i.  Applicant is indebted to Creditor I in the amount of about $128.  (Item 9 at
page 14.)  She admits this past due-debt, but has submitted nothing further in this
regard.  I find that this debt remains unpaid.

Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) describing the adjudicative process.  The administrative
judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of
variables known as the “whole-person concept.”  The administrative judge must
consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable
and unfavorable, in making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on
the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .”  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance
decision. 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration
of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty
of the applicant concerned.”  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in Paragraph 18:
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,
or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information.  An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate
funds.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under
Subparagraph 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially
disqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial
obligations@ may raise security concerns.  Applicant had significant past-due debts that
she has failed to demonstrate she has addressed.  I can find no countervailing
Mitigating Condition that is applicable here.  She has been gainfully employed since
2002, but has yet to address her debts.
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of Applicant’s
conduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of
whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense
judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person
concept.
The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process
factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
I considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and
mitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The record evidence leaves me with
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.
For this reason, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising
from her Financial Considerations.

Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a.~1.i. Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
