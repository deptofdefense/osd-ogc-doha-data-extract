Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows he has a history
of financial problems, which includes failure to file federal income tax returns and back
taxes owed to the IRS. He is now in compliance with the IRS and has an installment
agreement to resolve his account balance with the IRS. His financial problems are due,
in part, to circumstances largely beyond his control, such as: (1) the serious illness of
his spouse; (2) a lengthy marital separation; (3) his spouse’s period of unemployment
and underemployment; and (4) his diagnosis for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
as a result of his exposure to combat while serving with the U.S. Army. Given all the
circumstances, Applicant produced sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns
under the financial considerations guideline. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 At the hearing, Government Exhibits 1–5 and Applicant Exhibit A were admitted. 2

Statement of the Case
On November 5, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.1
The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the action under the
security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place February 21, 2013. The transcript (Tr.) was received March 4, 2013. 
The record was kept open until March 15, 2013, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentary exhibits. Applicant made a timely submission, and those
matters are admitted, without objections, as Exhibits B, C, D, and E.   2
Findings of Fact
As alleged in the SOR, Applicant admits the following: (1) owing back taxes to
the IRS for 2008 and 2009; (2) failing to file federal income tax returns for 2008 and
2009; and (3) owing three collection accounts and three unpaid judgments for a total of
about $11,863. He denied owing a $4,819 collection account, but admitted it at the
hearing.  His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact.3
In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee for a company engaged in defense
contracting. He works as an instructor at a military installation; his area of expertise is
field artillery; and he has had the same instructor job with a series of companies since
2006. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him.
Applicant’s employment history includes 20 years of honorable service in the
U.S. Army, from which he retired in 2006 as a sergeant first class. He held a security
clearance without incident while in the Army. His military service includes deployments
to Operations Desert Shield and Storm during 1990–1991, Bosnia during 2001, and
Operation Iraqi Freedom during 2003.  His decorations include the Meritorious Service4

Medal, Korea Defense Service Ribbon, and Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia). 
Applicant was diagnosed with PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.  He served5
in Iraq for about six months during January–July 2003, which was a time of intense
combat operations.  He participates in ongoing individual and group therapy. His6
symptoms include anxiety, sleep disturbance, and re-experiencing traumatic events,
and he has exhibited behaviors of avoidance, isolation, and irritability. His prognosis is
good. Applicant mentioned his PTSD diagnosis near the end of his testimony, he
became emotional when discussing the subject, and the hearing was recessed until he
was able to compose himself and continue.7
Applicant is married and has one child, a 18-year-old college student. His salary
is about $49,000 annually; his military retiree pay is about $22,000 annually; and his
wife is now earning about $1,500 monthly. He has a 16-year-old child from outside his
marriage, and he learned of the child in about 2009 when he was sued for paternity,
which was established in 2010. He was ordered to pay $725 monthly in ongoing child
support and ordered to pay $42,000 in arrears. Part of the $725 monthly payment is for
the arrears. He is current with his child support payments, which are automatically
deducted from his military retiree pay. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including federal tax problems,
which he does not dispute. His financial problems are confirmed by the documentary
exhibits.  His financial situation was stable until he neared retirement from the Army. His8
spouse was diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and he incurred additional expenses on
credit cards traveling back and forth from his duty station to her location. His spouse’s
health is now good, and his health insurance covered her necessary medical treatment
and expenses. Besides the additional financial obligation, the paternity lawsuit resulted
in marital separation that ended in 2011. The separation caused additional expenses for
separate households. In addition, his spouse lost her full-time job about two years ago
and then worked part-time until she recently obtained full-time employment.

Applicant is now in compliance with the IRS, the necessary returns were filed,
and he has an installment agreement to resolve his account balance with the IRS.  He9
owes back taxes for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. His estimated account
balance was $7,921 as of September 2012.  At the hearing he stated the account10
balance is about $12,000.  His installment agreement was established in about 2012 at11
the rate of $163 monthly, and in 2013 it was increased to $300 monthly.
The collection accounts and unpaid judgments in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.g are largely
unresolved.  He has reduced the balance of the $1,210 unpaid judgment in SOR ¶ 1.d12
to $395, and it should be paid off soon.  He also made at least two payments of $25713
each on the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.f.  In addition, he satisfied a judgment (not14
alleged in the SOR) in December 2012.  He considered seeking relief via bankruptcy,15
but decided that he would rather repay his debts. His plan is to negotiate repayment
agreements with the various creditors.   16
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As17
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt18
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

5
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An19
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting21
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An22
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate23
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme24
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it27
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant28
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline29
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  30
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems. This shows inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not31
meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more than sufficient to establish these32
disqualifying conditions. In addition, his failure to file federal tax returns is a concern.33
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F.  Based on the34
evidence before me, the most pertinent are AG ¶¶ 20(b), (c), and (d). First, AG ¶ 20(b)
applies because Applicant’s financial problems are due, in part, to circumstances largely
beyond his control, such as: (1) the serious illness of his spouse; (2) a lengthy marital
separation; (3) his spouse’s period of unemployment and underemployment; and (4) his
 This mitigating condition is not fully applicable because filing tax returns was within Applicant’s control, and35
it was irresponsible not to do so. 
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a36
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

diagnosis for PTSD as a result of his exposure to combat.  Moreover, he acted35
responsibly under the circumstances by continuing to provide for his spouse and
daughter as well as taking on an unexpected child support obligation. Second, AG ¶
20(c) applies because there are clear indications that his tax problems are in the
process of being resolved and are under control. And third, AG ¶ 20(d) applies because,
by coming into compliance with the IRS and entering into an installment agreement,
Applicant demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his tax problems.  36
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and37
trustworthiness consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F
cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.38
Here, the evidence shows that Applicant established an installment agreement
for the back taxes and is otherwise in compliance with the IRS. He has made  limited
progress in paying off the collection accounts and unpaid judgments. Given his track
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).39

record, this is not the type of financial case in which I would ordinarily grant a favorable
decision, but this case requires further consideration under the whole-person concept.39
First and foremost is the undisputed fact that Applicant is now suffering from
PTSD based on his service in Iraq. Considering his symptoms and related behaviors, it
is likely that the PTSD had a ripple effect throughout various areas of his life, including
finances. His PTSD is an important circumstance to consider, and a certain amount of
leeway and understanding is entirely appropriate in cases involving our veterans with
PTSD. Applicant has also made efforts to resolve his financial problems, and he has a
plan going forward to address his indebtedness, an amount that is not impossibly large.
Finally, I gave weight to his 20 years of honorable military service and the fact that he is
cognizant of his security responsibilities, which bodes well for his ability to protect
classified information. Weighing the evidence, I am persuaded that Applicant produced
sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. 
Based on the record before me, I have no doubts or concerns about Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. Accordingly, I
conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable
clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.h: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
