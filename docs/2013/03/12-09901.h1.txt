GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 17, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On August 31, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on September 
11, 2012.2 On November 28, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG), applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn statement, dated 
December 10, 2012, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on January 10, 2013. The case was assigned to me on 
January 16, 2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 18, 2013, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on February 12, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, 7 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and 11 of 
Applicant’s 17 exhibits (AE B through AE H, AE J, AE N, and AE P and AE Q) were 
admitted into evidence without objection. The remaining items were marked for 
identification and objected to by the Government. Applicant concurred in the objections, 
and those items, marked for identification, were excluded from consideration.3 Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 20, 2013. I kept the record open 
to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity, and 
he submitted eight additional documents which were marked as exhibits (AE R through 
AE Y) and admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j.). After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since May 
2011, had served initially as a technical data specialist II, but since June 2012, has 
been a supply support specialist. He was previously employed by other employers in 
various positions, including supply support, technical writer, management assistant, QA 
lead, technical aide, and management specialist.4 He had one relatively brief period of 
unemployment of one or two month’s duration in 2006.5 Applicant has never served in 
the U.S. military.6 He was granted a secret security clearance in March 2003, but it 
expired administratively.7 In May 2012, he was granted an interim security clearance,

but it was apparently suspended as part of the security clearance review process.8 
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in business administration in 2009, and a 
master’s degree in business in 2012.9 He was married the first time in September 2006, 
and divorced in September 2007.10 He married again in May 2010.11 Applicant has one 
son, born in 2001.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
It is unclear when, or if, Applicant started experiencing financial difficulties which 
might lead to accounts becoming delinquent and placed for collection or charged off. 
There is a credit report from May 2012, indicating a number of Applicant’s accounts 
were delinquent as early as 2007-2008.13 Applicant attributed those financial problems 
to his first wife, and claimed that he contacted his creditors and resolved the accounts 
where there was no dispute as to unpaid balances.14 There were other accounts that 
had disputed balances. Unable to have creditors or collection agents correct the 
disputed balances, at about the time he completed his SF 86, Applicant engaged the 
professional services of a company that specializes in challenging credit reporting 
companies to remove fraudulent and/or inaccurate accounts from credit reports.15 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial 
statement reflecting a family monthly net income of $5,639.66; monthly household, 
utility, transportation, and food expenses of $2,226; and monthly debt repayments of 
$717.74; leaving a monthly remainder of $2,695.92, available for discretionary spending 
or savings.16 Applicant also reported a savings account with $2,000, as well as $12,000 
in stocks and bonds.17 When he last viewed his retirement account, he had about 
$15,000 in it.18 Applicant is current on his rent and his utility bills.19

supports the creditor’s decision. Therefore, the creditors are being disputed. . . During my first marriage I collected a

The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies. There is an 
account, erroneously listed two separate times in the SOR, referred to as a line of credit 
and as a credit card, but which, according to Applicant, was actually a loan, with a major 
bank, with a high credit of $9,493, and an unpaid balance of $11,113, of which $1,400 
was past due, that was placed for collection and charged off (SOR && 1.a. and 1.h.).20 
Although the May 2012 credit report (using information reported by Equifax) listed the 
account as in collection and charged off, two subsequent Equifax credit reports referred 
to the account as a judgment for $11,113 obtained in August 2011.21 One Equifax credit 
report continued to refer to the account as merely charged off.22 Applicant contended 
that he routinely made his monthly payments on the account and the balance should 
have decreased. When the balance “dramatically increased,” without explanation, his 
efforts to resolve the increased balance were unsuccessful, and the account was turned 
over to his debt resolution company.23 Applicant contemplated hiring an attorney, but 
decided to make one last effort by contacting the creditor.24 In February 2013, the 
creditor and Applicant agreed to settle the account, with a reported balance of $663.58, 
for $2,500 to be paid in one installment of $1,500, and four installments of $250, 
commencing on February 15, 2013.25 Applicant made the first payment of $1,500 on 
February 8, 2013.26 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
There is a utility account in the amount of $553 that was placed for collection and 
charged off (SOR & 1.b.).27 Applicant determined that his ex-wife had opened the 
account in his name after their divorce without his knowledge or authorization, but when 
he initially disputed it, the creditor refused to delete his name from the account.28 
Finally, after challenging the account due to identity theft and fraud, and having the 
creditor conduct an investigation, on October 31, 2012, the creditor acknowledged the 
error, and moved to delete the negative information from Applicant’s credit reports.29 
The account has been resolved.

There is a jewelry store account with a high credit of $1,405 that was placed for 
collection and charged off.30 Applicant indicated he purchased his ex-wife’s wedding 
ring at the store for about $1,200, and made monthly payments on the account until the 
creditor went out of business, and payments started being returned to him.31 The 
account was subsequently transferred or sold, the high credit was increased to $1,628, 
and the past due balance was increased to $2,055 (SOR & 1.c.).32 Applicant attempted 
to reach the collection agent regarding the increased balance, but his calls were never 
returned.33 He also sought verification of the debt and requested a complete payment 
history and other relevant documentation, but all he received was another letter, with no 
supporting documentation. He turned the account over to his debt resolution company.34 
Applicant and the collection agent subsequently agreed to a settlement in the amount of 
$1,000, and Applicant paid that amount on January 30, 2013.35 The account has been 
resolved. 
 
There are five student loans with a variety of creditors, some of whom are 
identified in the SOR. One unattributed joint loan, purportedly opened in June 2011 with 
a high credit of $3,923 and a balance of $4,208, of which $2,015 was over 120 days 
past due, is listed in Applicant’s March 2012 credit report (SOR & 1.d.).36 The 
September 2012 credit report increased the past due amount to $4,031, and indicated 
the account was over 180 days past due.37 The January 2013 credit report increased 
the past due amount to $6,240, and indicated the account was over 180 days past 
due.38 Applicant was unaware of the lender’s identification, and disputed the allegation. 
In response to Applicant’s recent inquiry, the creditor confirmed that the loan was no 
longer being serviced by that particular company, and the listing on Applicant’s credit 
report will be deleted.39 
 
Another unattributed joint loan, also purportedly opened in June 2011 with a high 
credit of $5,858 and a balance of $6,232, of which $3,009 was over 120 days past due, 
is listed in Applicant’s March 2012 credit report (SOR & 1.e.).40 The September 2012 
credit report increased the past due amount to $4,031, and indicated the account was

over 180 days past due.41 The January 2013 credit report increased the past due 
amount to $6,240, and indicated the account was over 180 days past due.42 Applicant 
was unaware of the lender’s identification, and he disputed the allegation. In response 
to Applicant’s recent inquiry, the creditor confirmed that the loan was no longer being 
serviced by that particular company, and the listing on Applicant’s credit report will be 
deleted.43 
 
There is a deferred student loan, purportedly opened in September 2005 with a 
high credit of $3,867 and a zero balance that was over 180 days past due when a claim 
was filed with the Government for the insured balance of the loan. The account is listed 
in Applicant’s March 2012 credit report (SOR & 1.f.).44 Both the September 2012 and 
January 2013 credit reports indicated the account was “transferred to recovery.”45 The 
November 2012 credit report reflects the loan as “paid and closed.”46 Applicant was 
unaware of the lender’s identification, and he disputed the allegation. He subsequently 
learned that the loan was consolidated with another student loan, and the status of the 
combined loans is considered deferred.47 
 
There is another deferred student loan, purportedly opened in April 2006 with a 
high credit of $2,762 and a zero balance that was over 180 days past due when a claim 
was filed with the Government for the insured balance of the loan. The account is listed 
in Applicant’s March 2012 credit report (SOR & 1.g.).48 Neither the September 2012 nor 
the January 2013 credit report listed the account. Applicant was unaware of the lender’s 
identification, and disputed the allegation. The November 2012 credit report reflects the 
loan as “paid and closed.”49 Applicant was unaware of the lender’s identification, and he 
disputed the allegation. He subsequently learned that the loan was consolidated with 
another student loan, and the status of the combined loans is considered deferred.50 
 
There is a student loan from a national bank, purportedly opened in August 2006 
with both a high credit and balance of $14,634 that was placed for collection and 
charged off. The account is listed in Applicant’s March 2012 credit report (SOR & 1.i.).51

Both the September 2012 and January 2013 credit reports indicated the account was 
being disputed.52 The creditor is unable to locate any loan documents in Applicant’s 
name or social security number, and a manager suggested that Applicant file a report 
with the creditor’s fraud department to initiate the removal of the listing from Applicant’s 
credit reports.53 Applicant filed the report.54 
 
Applicant turned all five student loan accounts over to his debt resolution 
company to dispute or validate.55 He also presented documentation from the National 
Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Every student loan ever received by Applicant, 
whether it was direct consolidated subsidized or unsubsidized, direct Stafford 
subsidized or unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), was listed in the 
system. Those official records from the U.S. Department of Education indicated all of his 
student loans were in one of the following statuses: non-defaulted, paid in full through 
consolidation loan, cancelled, or in repayment. While some of those student loans had 
been previously deferred, or in forbearance, not a single student loan was ever in 
default.56 Applicant attributed his problems with the student loans to a common practice 
among student loan servicers in routinely transferring such loans among various loan-
servicing companies in an effort to make the system more efficient, but also creating 
confusion during the transition period.57 Furthermore, I have compared each of the SOR 
allegations with the data reflected in the NSLDS documentation, and I am unable to find 
one loan that can be identified as in default, past due or charged off, as alleged in the 
SOR or as listed in the previously specified credit reports. They should no longer be 
reflected in Applicant’s credit reports as alleged. These accounts have been resolved. 
 
There is an apartment lease account in the amount of $1,412 that was placed for 
collection (SOR & 1.j.).58 Applicant was in his apartment one evening in 2007 when 
someone attempted to break into the apartment by kicking in the front door. When the 
perpetrator discovered Applicant was in the apartment, he fled. Applicant called the 
police, but the perpetrator could not be found. The door sustained $500 damage. A 
police report was filed.59 Applicant was concerned for his safety and reported the

under a student loan forgiveness program, the remaining balance of his student loans will be forgiven after ten years 
if he continues to work for a “tribal organizational entity” such as his current employer. See GE 2 (Letter, dated 
September 23, 2012).

incident to the property manager. The manager told Applicant the lease could be voided 
if Applicant could furnish documentation of the incident. Applicant did so, and moved.60 
About one year later, Applicant received a bill for the broken lease. The old apartment 
manager had departed without leaving any record of the agreement, and the new 
property manager demanded payment.61 Applicant and the creditor subsequently 
agreed to a repayment settlement, and Applicant paid the creditor $988.62 The creditor 
confirmed the debt was satisfied.63 The account has been resolved. 
 
Work Performance and Character References 
 
 Applicant’s work performance and character have been described by a senior 
company management in extremely positive terms. The president, vice president-
operations, facility security officer, office manager, and the senior program 
manager/direct supervisor, are very supportive of his application for a security 
clearance. Applicant has been described as possessing an “outstanding repertoire of 
technical and educational skills, strength of character,” along with a “holistic approach to 
getting the job done.” Applicant also possesses “the highest caliber of character and 
responsibility.” Applicant is “a very up front and honest person, He is a dedicated and 
loyal worker.” He is considered “a fine young man of integrity.”64 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”65 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”66   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating

information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”67 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.68  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”69 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”70 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2007-2008, Applicant started experiencing some 
financial difficulties, but over the next few years he was able to resolve them. However, 
there were other accounts that had disputed balances, or were disputed in their entirety, 
and Applicant was initially unable to have creditors or collection agents correct those 
disputed accounts. His credit reports reflected accounts that were in collection or 
charged off, and those entries are the basis of the SOR allegations. AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.71 In addition, it is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) when the individual has 
                                                          
71
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
11 
                                      
 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. The nature, frequency, and 
relative recency of Applicant’s purported financial difficulties since 2007-2008 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” In an effort to 
address and resolve his accounts, Applicant contacted his creditors and collection 
agents regarding the alleged delinquent accounts, and sought validation and verification 
of those accounts. Those creditors that supplied the satisfactory validation or verification 
were paid. Those creditors that failed to furnish Applicant with the requested 
information, or whose accounts Applicant did not recognize, were disputed and 
eventually deleted from his credit report. The student loan accounts were incorrectly 
reported in his credit reports as past due, in collection, or charged off, but those reports 
were proven to be factually erroneous. Despite his contentions and protestations 
regarding his accounts, Applicant was issued an SOR, and his interim security 
clearance was suspended. He had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of some 
of the accounts or their respective balances, and provided documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of his disputes. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.72 
Commencing in 2007-2008, and continuing over the next few years, several 
events, largely beyond Applicant’s control, occurred that caused him some actual, as 
well as alleged, financial problems: his ex-wife’s actions in opening at least one account 
in his name without his knowledge or approval; his landlord’s disavowal of an earlier 
release of Applicant from a lease; a creditor going out of business; the rather convoluted 
manner in which student loans were handled by loan servicing companies; the difficulty 
in dealing with various collection agents; the lengthy dispute process in having 
erroneous negative accounts deleted from his credit report; and the reporting of 
unverified negative information by credit reporting agencies.  
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the combined credit reports and the Equifax credit reports referred to numerous 
creditors for relatively few delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names and 
acronyms, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the 
financial concerns. Likewise, the absence of account numbers or the true identity of the 
original creditors in the SOR to link an allegation to a particular account makes it more 
difficult for an applicant to track down the various creditors or collection agents 
associated with those accounts. The Appeal Board has previously held that “adverse 
information from a credit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard.” 
However, when the information in the credit report is refuted by documentation from the 
actual creditor, and the credit reporting company is furnished the correct information but 
still refuses or fails to correct its entries in a timely manner, one can conclude that the 
information in the credit report – actually a summary or secondary evidence pertaining 
to an account – is less accurate, trustworthy, or reliable than the other evidence of 
record.73 
As noted above, Applicant had addressed and resolved a number of accounts 
before his interim security clearance was suspended. There are clear indications that 
the problem, to the extent there was one, is being resolved or is under control. Applicant 
acted responsibly by addressing all of his accounts.74  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
                                                          
73
 In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the substantial 
evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent 
allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
74
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.75       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His relative 
inattention to some of his finances permitted a number of accounts, including some that 
were not his or those with inaccurate reporting, to become delinquent. As a result, some 
accounts were placed for collection or transferred.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant contacted all of his creditors and collection agents, and sought validation and 
verification of those accounts. Those creditors that supplied the satisfactory validation or 
verification were paid. Those creditors that failed to furnish Applicant with the requested 
information, or whose accounts Applicant did not recognize, were disputed and 
eventually deleted from his credit report. The student loan accounts were incorrectly 
reported in his credit reports as past due, in collection, or charged off, but those reports 
were proven to be factually erroneous. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. He possesses an excellent reputation in the workplace. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:76 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
                                                          
75
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. He resolved several accounts and successfully disputed other accounts. As 
for his student loans, the credit reports are inaccurate, and with documentation from the 
U.S. Department of Education, he has presented a more accurate picture of the status 
of his student loans. They are all non-defaulted, paid in full through consolidation loan, 
cancelled, or in repayment. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and 
doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his 
financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant   
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
