HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists seven debts, totaling $56,073. He 
showed poor judgment in his generation of delinquent debts. Even though he earned 
$136,627 overseas in 2010, he did not make any payments on his mortgage until 
November 2010, and he under withheld on his federal income taxes. Although he made 
some recent progress on resolving his delinquent debts, it is not sufficient. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated at this time. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 15, 2011, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 7). On 
June 15, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an SOR to Applicant, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President 
on December 29, 2005. 
 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to 
determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
On July 18, 2012, Applicant provided a response to the SOR allegations. On 
August 13, 2012, Applicant clarified that he wanted a decision without a hearing. (file of 
relevant material (FORM) at 2) A complete copy of the FORM, dated October 17, 2012, 
was provided to Applicant. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant provided responses 
to the FORM on December 9, 2012, December 11, 2012, and January 4, 2013. The 
case was assigned to me on January 14, 2013. 
 
On January 29, 2013, I issued a decision denying Applicant’s eligibility for access 
to classified information. On February 4, 2013, Department Counsel discovered 
documents dated December 28, 2012, Applicant submitted to DOHA that were misfiled 
in the hearing office. On February 4, 2013, Department Counsel provided the 
documents to me, along with a cover letter, and I forwarded them to the Appeal Board 
because I had lost jurisdiction of Applicant’s case when my decision was issued on 
January 29, 2013. On March 22, 2013, the Appeal Board remanded the case back to 
me with direction that Applicant’s case receive “PRIORITY attention.” A copy of 
Applicant’s appeal was not provided to me.      
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the debts in the SOR, 
except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, and he provided extenuating information. (SOR 
response) His admissions are accepted as factual findings. He denied the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.e, emphasizing its listing on his bankruptcy petition as a corporate debt. (SOR 
response at 9) 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old construction and carpentry specialist, who has been 
employed by a defense contractor since April 2011.3 In 1986, he married, and in 1996, 
he was divorced. In 1997, he married. He has a teenage son and an adult stepson. He 
has never served in the military.  
  
                                            
1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated October 22, 2012, and Applicant’s receipt is dated 
November 2, 2012. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt 
to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports, his SOR response, and his FORM responses establish 
seven delinquent debts, totaling $56,073. Applicant’s corporation filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy in March 2007, and this bankruptcy was terminated in late May 2007.4 (SOR 
¶ 1.a)   
 
Federal taxes 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b is a federal tax lien for $14,891 filed by the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) in June 2010 and 1.g is a federal tax debt for $4,231 for tax year 2010—
Unresolved.  
 
A January 2007 IRS letter describes a $145,000 debt owed by Applicant’s 
corporation to the federal Government. Applicant’s corporation underpaid corporate 
quarterly payments from September 30, 2005, to June 30, 2006, on IRS Form 941, 
which pertains to employee withholding for federal income and Social Security taxes, 
and his corporation owes $145,395. (SOR response, Tab D) The IRS letter is 
addressed to Applicant’s corporation in care of Applicant. This IRS letter lists the 
following quarterly debts: 
 
3rd Qtr 2005  $74,152  4th Qtr 2005 $42,443  
1st Qtr 2006  $16,517   2nd Qtr 2006 $10,309 
 
 Applicant had ten employees in his construction corporation. (SOR response 3 at 
7) He received the IRS notice of intent to levy $145,395, and he had three meetings 
with the IRS. (SOR response 3 at 8) In March 2007, the IRS issued a lien against 
Applicant’s corporation for $131,662 in unpaid taxes. (Item 11; FORM at 7 n. 34 (citing 
lexis.com) Corporate federal tax debt is not listed in Applicant’s corporate bankruptcy as 
a liability, and it is not alleged in the SOR as raising a security concern.5 Applicant 
                                            
4Applicant’s bankruptcy petition was “terminated,” as individuals, not corporations, are entitled to 
a “discharge” under federal bankruptcy law. See 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(l) (“The court shall grant the debtor, 
unless (1) the debtor is not an individual.”); FORM at 6 n. 25) Small corporations may use a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy to liquidate assets and debts. Use of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy usually results in liquidation of 
the corporation.   
 
5Applicant’s SOR does not allege that Applicant owes a $145,000 debt to the federal Government 
because he under-withheld employee payments for income and Social Security taxes, and his SOR does 
not allege security concerns under the alcohol consumption guideline. He was charged with driving while 
under the influence of alcohol in April 1984, September 1985, and September 1999. (SOR response, 
Alcohol Tab at I-5, I-6) In July 2002, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Id. at I-7. 
In his SF-86, he did not indicate he was terminated from employment for alcohol consumption; however, 
in a response to an interrogatory, he disclosed he was terminated from employment for having alcohol on 
his breath when he returned overseas from R & R (rest and relaxation or rest and recreation) leave. 
Compare Items 5 at 75 and 7 at 23 with SOR response, Alcohol Tab at I-2. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in 
an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
 
4 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
contends that the $145,395 federal tax debt was reduced to and included in his 
personal IRS tax debt of about $20,000, which is listed in the SOR. (SOR response at 
8)6 He states he paid the IRS $4,300, is continuing to pay the IRS monthly, and now 
owes the IRS $16,451. (SOR response at 8; SOR response, Tabs E and F) A February 
4, 2012 IRS letter indicates Applicant owes the IRS $20,451 for the following quarters in 
the listed amounts:   
 
2005:  $5,986 2nd Qtr 2006: $6,309 4th Qtr 2006: $4,113  2010: $4,044 
 
(Item 12, Tab J at I-144) The $145,395 IRS debt has a different IRS number than the 
$20,451 IRS debt. Compare SOR response, Tab D (tax debt account number ends in 
“437”) with SOR response, Tab F (tax debt account number ends in “944”). 
 
On June 22, 2011, Applicant agreed to pay the IRS $500 monthly. (SOR 
response, Tabs H, J) He made seven $500 payments on June 30, 2011; August 1, 
2011; September 1, 2011; October 3, 2011; November 1, 2011; January 10, 2012; and 
February 1, 2012. (Item 4 at 3; Item 12, Tab H; SOR response, Tab Q at 38, 42-43, 45, 
48)7 For the tax period ending on December 31, 2005, Applicant owed $5,992, and 
$3,000 of the $3,500 in tax payments were applied to tax year 2005. (Item 4 at 4) He 
owed additional taxes of $6,316 for the tax period ending on March 31, 2006; he owed 
$4,118 for the tax period ending on June 30, 2006; and he owed $4,048 for the tax 
period ending December 31, 2010. (Item 4 at 4) On July 9, 2012, the IRS indicated the 
ending balance owed was $16,672. (Item 4 at 4) Applicant’s July 18, 2012 SOR 
response indicates he is “continuing to make restitution monthly” to the IRS; however, 
he did not provide any evidence of payments after February 1, 2012. (Item 4 at 1; SOR 
response at 8) His FORM responses provided updated proof of payments to the state 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Consideration of the $145,000 federal tax debt (because it is a non-SOR allegation) in 
this decision is strictly limited to these five circumstances. The alcohol-related allegations are not 
considered for any purpose. 
 
6Applicant provided his IRS form 1040s for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010 (SOR response Tab Q at 
23-31) He provided his complete 2011 federal tax return. (SOR response, Tab J, T at 12-28) His 2011 
federal tax return shows: wages and salaries of $32,730; overseas income of $16,258; $0 tax; $1,000 tax 
paid; and $1,000 refund due from the IRS. (SOR response, Tab T at 12-13) 
  
7Applicant’s 2011 federal tax return includes the following supplemental information: 
 
Taxpayer was a shareholder of a company named . . . . The company closed its doors 
and is no longer in business. Certain payroll taxes were not remitted to the IRS and 
[Applicant] is making payments against this company obligation. In 2011 [Applicant] 
remitted $2,500 to the IRS.

tax authority; however, he did not provide updated information about his federal tax 
payments. (FORM responses)  
 
State tax debts  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c is a state tax lien for $2,940 filed in November 2008; 1.d is a State 
tax lien for $7,171 filed in April 2007; and 1.h is a State tax debt for $535 for tax year 
2009—Payment Plan.  
 
In March 2007, the state released a state tax lien for $16,021 that was filed in 
October 2006. (Item 12, Tab G and Financial Tab) On April 23, 2007, the state 
approved Applicant’s request for termination of his corporate business. (Item 12, Tabs 
G and G.1 at I-65 (reflecting balance due to state as of September 12, 2011, for tax 
period 2009 alone as $535.00))  
 
In October 2011, Applicant submitted a payment installment plan request to the 
state. (Item 12, Tab G.1 at I-62, I-63) On November 29, 2011, the state noted the 
balance due was $10,502, and his proposed payment plan was denied because his 
reported monthly expenses ($4,975) were greater than his reported income ($0.00). 
(Item 12, Tab G.1 at I-54, I-58, I-63) On December 13, 2011, Applicant wrote the state 
that he did not have any income because he lost his employment in March 2011, as he 
did not have a security clearance. (Item 12, Tab G.1 at I-53, I-55)   
 
On May 30, 2012, the state wrote that Applicant’s state tax debt was $10,659; 
the state accepted his payment plan of $250 a month; and his first payment was due on 
July 1, 2012. (SOR response, Tab I at 1, 2) He provided documentation showing $250 
payments to the State on July 5, August 1, September 4, October 1, November 2, and 
December 3, 2012. (December 9, 2012 FORM response at state tax Tabs; SOR 
response, Tab I at 3)  
 
Collection debt 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is a collection debt for $22,223—Established Payment Plan. 
Applicant listed the debt on Schedule F of his 2007 bankruptcy filing as one of the 
corporate debts of his construction corporation. (SOR response, Tab I at 1) There is no 
indication that the creditor received anything from the corporate liquidation. The 
corporate assets were $108,430 in accounts receivable and some office equipment. 
(SOR response, Tab I at Schedule B) Corporate liabilities were $501,961. (SOR 
response, Tab I at Summary of Schedules) He contended that the collection debt for 
$22,223 was a corporate liability, and he was not personally responsible for it. (Item 12, 
Financial Tab)  
 
In his SOR Response, Applicant said a representative of the creditor told him that 
Applicant (he probably meant the creditor) had documentation that he had signed a 
personal guarantee for the loan. (SOR response at 9) Applicant said he requested, but 
did not receive, documentation of his personal guarantee from the creditor. (SOR 
response at 9) He asked his CPA if he was responsible for the $22,223 collection debt, 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
and his accountant advised Applicant that if it was a corporate debt, he is not personally 
responsible for paying the debt. His accountant did not state the debt actually was a 
corporate debt. (SOR response at 9; December 9, 2012 FORM response at paragraph 
3c and Tab B) Applicant said he would pay the $22,223 collection debt, if he was 
responsible for it. (SOR response 3 at 9) 
 
On December 12, 2012, Applicant offered to settle the $22,223 collection debt by 
paying 25% of the debt through payments. (December 11, 2012 FORM response) He 
said the creditor counter-offered to settle the debt for a single $5,000 payment. 
(December 11, 2012 FORM response) Applicant said he would ask his relatives for a 
loan, and he would call the creditor on December 11, 2012. (December 11, 2012 FORM 
response)  
 
On December 17, 2012, Applicant informed the creditor that he was unable to 
borrow the money for a lump-sum payment, and he offered to pay $100 monthly. He 
reiterated that he believed he did not personally guarantee the loan and that it was a 
business debt. (December 28, 2012 FORM response at 2) On December 19, 2012, the 
creditor counter-offered with two payment plans: (1) pay $1,000 monthly for three 
months beginning on December 28, 2012; or (2) pay $100 monthly for 45 months 
beginning on December 28, 2012. (December 28, 2012 FORM response at 2, 5) On 
December 21, 2012, Applicant paid the creditor $1,000. (December 28, 2012 FORM 
response at 2, 6) 
 
Mortgage debt 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a mortgage account that is past due in the amount of $4,082—
Unresolved. Applicant purchased his residence in June 1984 for $80,000. (SOR 
response, Tab Q at 8) He did not describe when or why he borrowed additional funds 
secured by his residence.  
 
In 2010, Applicant applied for a loan modification. On September 30, 2010, the 
creditor offered mortgage terms to Applicant and noted his delinquent interest from 
December 1, 2009 to November 1, 2010 was $20,214; delinquent escrow owed was 
$5,977 for a total delinquency of $26,191. (SOR response, Tab M) In November 2010, 
his mortgage was $374,111; his interest rate was 6.375%; and under the new 
mortgage, his new interest rate would range from 2% (first five years) to 4.375% (at 
year eight), and the new monthly payment at 2% interest, including escrow fees, was 
$2,129. (SOR response, Tab M) The 2010 mortgage modification was apparently 
successful, as Applicant provided a November 5, 2011 checking account statement 
showing a mortgage payment of $2,041. (SOR response, Tab Q at 51-52) 
   
On November 22, 2011, Applicant paid his mortgage creditor $2,041. (SOR 
response, Tab Q at 52) His mortgage was current on November 30, 2011. (SOR 
response, Tab Q at 63) On December 12, 2011, Applicant applied for a loan 
modification. He indicated his mortgage balance was $356,382 with a monthly payment 
 
7 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
of $2,041.8 His net monthly remainder was negative $5,331; on five credit cards he 
owed: $23,264; $7,412; $461; $1,658; and $1,808; he had $55 in his checking account 
and $40 in his savings account; and he and his spouse’s total annual income is $12. 
 
On December 8, 2012, Applicant received an email from the mortgage creditor 
indicating the file was complete for a loan modification, and the file was in review. 
(December 9, 2012 FORM response at Tab E) On December 8, 2012, the creditor 
offered to suspend the foreclosure process if Applicant made payments of $1,802 on 
January 1, 2013, February 1, 2013, and March 1, 2013. (December 11, 2012 FORM 
response) The mortgage modification documentation he provided does not specify the 
amount of the mortgage or mortgage payment after the three-month-foreclosure 
abeyance. (December 11, 2012 FORM response) On December 18, 2012, Applicant 
signed an agreement to pay the creditor as requested in creditor’s December 8, 2013 
letter. (December 28, 2012 FORM response at 2, 7) On January 3, 2013, Applicant 
made a $1,802 payment to the creditor. (January 4, 2013 FORM response) 
 
Employment and income 
 
Between 1980 and 1995, Applicant worked for a variety of construction 
companies. (SOR response) Between 1995 and 2006, he ran his own construction 
corporation. (SOR response; Item 6) In 2003, Applicant’s construction corporation had a 
disagreement with a customer over the scope of work to be performed and about 
payments, including a $285,000 “draw,” which was needed to finance labor and 
equipment for the project. (Item 4 at 6-7) In 2005, Applicant’s lawsuit was settled for 
$171,000. Applicant’s lawyer received $51,300, and his corporation received $119,700, 
which Applicant described as a “death sentence” because of the corporation’s bills. 
(Item 4 at 6-7) 
 
After the lawsuit, Applicant was unable to obtain performance and payment 
bonds, and it became very difficult to obtain construction contracts. (Item 4 at 6-7) From 
2005 to 2006, Applicant received slow and inadequate payments, which caused him to 
fall behind on his tax payments. (Item 4 at 7 and Attachments A, B; SOR ¶ 1.b (IRS lien 
for $14,891); SOR ¶ 1.d (state tax lien for $7,171)). 
 
Applicant worked from May 2006 to May 2007 for another construction 
corporation, and in 2008, he was unemployed. (SOR response at 9, Item 7 at 21) From 
2009 to early 2011, he worked in several construction jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
he was unemployed when he was between jobs. (SOR response at 10-13; Item 7 at 15-
20) He was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2010 to July 2010 and from 
September 2010 to March 2011. (SOR response, Tab T at 26) He provided information 
about his positive construction contributions in Afghanistan and support of the Marine 
Corps missions. (SOR responses, Tabs D, E and L)

Applicant’s February 16, 2011 Social Security statement shows the following 
taxed Medicare earnings for the tax years 2000 to 2009:

In 2010, Applicant's wages and salaries totaled $136,627, and he was able to 
deduct $81,252 because he was overseas, reducing his adjusted gross income (AGI) to 
$52,375. (SOR responses, Tabs E, H, Q at 23) In 2010, one corporation paid him 
$133,732 in wages and salary. (SOR response, Tab Q) He only withheld $820 of his 
$136,627 income, and his taxes were $5,940, resulting in $5,120 owed to the IRS. 
(SOR response, Tab Q at 24) 
 
Applicant’s IRS form 1040 tax return for tax year 2011 shows wages of $32,730 
and adjusted gross income of $13,472. (SOR response, Tab T at 12) Applicant’s bank

Applicant has been employed from February 2, 2012, to December 9, 2012, as a 
construction estimator. (December 9, 2012 FORM response at paragraph 4a)   
Applicant’s November 23, 2012 income statement showed hourly pay of $40.77 per 
hour and annual pay year to date of $69,635. (December 9, 2012 FORM response at 
Tab D) In 2012, he withheld $6,376 for federal income taxes and $3,151 for state taxes. 
(December 9, 2012 FORM response at Tab D)    
 
The FORM provides a good discussion of the rationale for the security concerns 
at issue. The FORM reads, “Applicant states he continues to make monthly payments to 
the IRS. According to Item 5, however, he has not made payments since February 1, 
2012.” (FORM at 8) The FORM also highlights the absence of evidence of, “any basis 
for [Applicant’s] conclusion [that the $22,223 collection debt was a corporate and not a

personal debt]. Most importantly, he provides no documentation to support his belief 
that he does not remain personally responsible for the debt.” (FORM at 9)  
 
The FORM advised Applicant of his right to submit “objections, rebuttal, 
extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate.” (FORM at 15) An October 22, 
2012 letter from the DOHA Director encouraged Applicant to submit material on his 
behalf to DOHA. Applicant’s FORM response included bank statements showing 
payments to address his state tax debt and one mortgage payment; however, there was 
no documentation showing payments to address his federal tax debt after February 1, 
2012. The only documentation about his belief that that the $22,223 collection debt was 
a corporate and not a personal debt is a statement that his accountant believes he is 
not responsible for the debt, if it is a corporate debt. On January 4, 2013, he said he 
“will continue to make” his payments to the IRS, the state, his mortgage creditor, and to 
the creditor holding the $22,223 collection debt. (January 2, 2013 FORM response)  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
 
10 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
 
11 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his SOR response, and his FORM responses. Applicant’s SOR lists 
seven debts, totaling $56,073. Some of his SOR debts have been delinquent for more 
than five years. He owes delinquent state and federal taxes, and his mortgage debt is in 
rehabilitation rather than current status. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants limited application of all five 
mitigating conditions. Although he did not describe receipt of any formal financial 
counseling, it is evident that he understands budgeting, loans, and financial matters. He 
successfully ran a construction corporation with at least 10 employees for several years. 
He showed some good faith11 when he admitted responsibility for his SOR debts, and 
                                            
11The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
12 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
he made some progress and payments to some creditors. Applicant’s financial situation 
was damaged by his unemployment, the reduction in real estate values, and the 
collapse of his corporation in 2007, which are circumstances largely beyond his control.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the financial concern in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
Applicant's corporation filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2007, and this 
bankruptcy was terminated in late May 2007. The corporate assets were $108,430 in 
accounts receivables and some office equipment. Corporate liabilities were $501,961. 
Applicant’s bankruptcy petition was “terminated;” however, small corporations may use 
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate assets and debts and to assist in termination of the 
corporation. Applicant’s use of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was reasonable and not done 
in bad faith.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating three state tax debts: (1) SOR ¶ 1.c for 
$2,940 filed in 2008; (2) SOR ¶ 1.d for $7,171 filed in 2007; and (3) SOR ¶ 1.h for $535 
for 2009. In March 2007, the state released a state tax lien for $16,021 that was filed in 
October 2006. On May 30, 2012, the state wrote that his debt was $10,659 and the 
state accepted his payment plan of $250 a month. On July 5, August 1, September 4, 
October 1, November 2, and December 3, 2012, Applicant made $250 payments to the 
state. These six payments are sufficient to establish a track record of payments, 
addressing his state tax debt. 
 
Applicant has made minimal progress resolving his federal income tax debts. In 
2010, Applicant's wages and salaries totaled $136,627, and he was able to deduct 
$81,252 from his income for tax purposes because he was overseas, substantially 
reducing his federal taxes and increasing his after-tax income. In 2010, he only withheld 
$820 of his $136,627 income for federal income taxes, and his taxes were $5,940, 
resulting in $5,120 owed. He was aware that he had delinquent federal income taxes 
from 2005 and 2006. In 2010, he did not make any payments to address his delinquent 
federal tax debts. He made seven $500 payments between June 30, 2011 and February 
1, 2012. The amount of his federal income tax debt is unclear, as he may owe a 
substantial debt from his 2005-2006 failure to withhold sufficient federal tax and Social 
Security funds for his employees at his corporation. He did not provide sufficient proof to 
establish his $145,395 federal corporate tax debt was reduced to and included in his 
personal IRS tax debt of about $16,451. 
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
He did not provide a credible plan for resolving several of his delinquent SOR debts. He 
made some payments to the IRS, then he apparently stopped making payments, even 
though he has been employed since February 2012. On December 21, 2012, he made 
a $1,000 payment to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e ($22,223) and established a payment 
plan. He now owes two, $1,000 monthly payments to the creditor, and the debt will be 
resolved. He has made sufficient progress to mitigate the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. On 
September 30, 2010, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f offered significantly improved mortgage

terms to Applicant and noted delinquent interest from December 1, 2009, to November 
1, 2010, is $20,214; delinquent escrow owed is $5,977; and total delinquency is 
$26,191. He did not make payments to his mortgage creditor for most of 2010, even 
though his wages and salaries from 2010 totaled $136,627. He recently started a three-
month mortgage loan rehabilitation plan; however, this is an inadequate track record to 
show he will accept the ultimate payment plan and systematically make payments. He 
did not provide proof that he continuously maintained contact with all of his creditors.12 
There is insufficient evidence that his financial problems are being resolved and are 
under control. AG ¶ 20(e) does not fully apply because he failed to provide documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed debts or evidence of actions to resolve 
disputed debts sufficient to show any disputes were reasonable. The file lacks evidence 
that he has acted responsibly on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. He is a 53-year-old construction and 
carpentry specialist. In 1997, he married. He has a teenage son and an adult stepson. 
He has never served in the military. Circumstances largely beyond his control damaged 
                                            
12“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n. 9 
(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A 
component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep debts current.

his finances, including the collapse of his corporation in 2007, the decline in the real 
estate market, and his unemployment. He is sufficiently mature to understand and 
comply with his security responsibilities. He has substantial experience with budgeting, 
borrowing, and other financial issues. He made seven $500 payments between June 
30, 2011, and February 1, 2012, to address his delinquent federal taxes. From July 5, 
2012, to December 3, 2012, he made six $250 payments in compliance with his 
payment plan to the state taxing authority, establishing a track record of paying his state 
tax debt. Over the last two years, he renegotiated his mortgage, and he made some 
mortgage payments. On December 21, 2012, he made a $1,000 payment to the creditor 
in SOR ¶ 1.e, establishing a payment plan. If he makes two, $1,000 monthly payments 
to the creditor, this debt will be resolved. His single substantial payment is sufficient 
progress to mitigate the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. In January 2013, he made a payment to the 
mortgage creditor to rehabilitate his delinquent mortgage, and his foreclosure was 
placed in abeyance. He used bankruptcy to assist in the liquidation of his construction 
corporation. He deserves some credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government 
as an employee of a contractor. He supported the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. In 2010, Applicant's wages and salaries totaled $136,627, 
and he was able to deduct $81,252 from his income for tax purposes because he was 
overseas. In 2010, he only withheld $820 of his $136,627 income for federal income 
taxes, and his taxes were $5,940, resulting in $5,120 owed in addition to his delinquent 
federal income taxes from 2005 and 2006. In 2010, he did not make any payments to 
address his delinquent federal tax debts. The amount of his federal income tax debt is 
unclear, as he may owe $145,395 from his 2005-2006 failure to withhold sufficient funds 
for his corporate employees’ federal and Social Security taxes. He did not provide 
sufficient proof to establish his $145,395 federal corporate tax debt was reduced to and 
included in his personal IRS tax debt of about $16,451. From December 1, 2009 to 
November 1, 2010, Applicant’s failure to pay his mortgage creditor generated $20,214 
in delinquent interest and $5,977 in delinquent escrow for taxes and insurance. He did 
not make payments to his mortgage creditor for most of 2010, even though his wages 
and salaries in 2010 totaled $136,627. There is insufficient documentary evidence of 
variations in his income to cause him to make such minimal progress resolving his 
delinquent federal income taxes and mortgage debt. He did not provide sufficient 
documentary proof that he disputed any debts. Applicant failed to make sufficient 
progress establishing his financial responsibility to fully mitigate security concerns.      
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
