FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 7, 2011. On 
December 7, 2012, the Defense of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 13, 2012; answered it on December 
27, 2012; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
was ready to proceed on January 18, 2013, and the case was assigned to me on 
January 23, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing on January 28, 2013, scheduling it for February 25, 2013. I convened the 
 
2 
 
hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified and presented the testimony of one witness. I kept 
the record open until March 4, 2013, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He 
timely submitted AX A and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr.) on March 5, 2013. 
 
Amendment of SOR 
 
 On my own motion, I amended SOR ¶ 1.z by changing the amount alleged from 
$4,283 to $2,322, to conform to the evidence in GX 3. (Tr. 91.) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His 
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is a 41-year-old pipefitter employed by a defense contractor at a naval 
shipyard since March 2011. He served in the U.S. Navy from June 1990 to November 
1995 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance in the Navy 
but it was administratively terminated upon his discharge. He served in the Army 
National Guard from June 1989 to June 1990 and was honorably discharged.  
 
Applicant was employed by a defense contractor and enrolled in an 
apprenticeship at a naval shipyard from February 1998 to March 1999, but he did not 
complete it. (GX 2 at 5.) He was readmitted to the apprenticeship program in January 
2012, and he expects to complete it in October 2015. (Tr. 80.) 
 
 Applicant testified that he was unemployed for various periods totaling about two 
years after he was discharged from the Navy. He testified he was unemployed in 2000, 
and “several other times” and that his unemployment caused him to fall behind on his 
child support payments. However, his SCA reflects continuous employment from 
October 2003 to the present. It reflects that he was a route manager for a commercial 
cleaning service from October 2003 to November 2005, and left for a better job. He was 
employed by the U.S. Postal Service from November 2005 to March 2009, but left this 
job because he wanted more time with his family. (GX 2 at 6.) He worked as a route 
service representative for a food service from March 2009 to March 2011, and left this 
job to work for his current employer. He testified that he was unemployed from January 
to March 2011, but this period of unemployment was not reflected on his SCA. (GX 1 at 
11-14; Tr. 51-52.) 
 
 Applicant married in August 1992 and divorced in April 1997. He married again 
September 1998 and divorced in July 2002. He married his current spouse in November 
2002. They separated in 2007, reconciled, separated again in 2011, reconciled, and 
separated for the third time in January 2013. (GX 2 at 6; Tr. 41-42, 66.) They intend to 
divorce. Each time they separated, Applicant incurred the additional expense of 
maintaining a separate household. (Tr. 63.) 
 
3 
 
 After Applicant married his current spouse, they decided to buy a house and “do 
a lot of other things” that did not seem to be beyond their means at the time. Applicant 
and his spouse filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in February 2007, because they 
were unable to keep up with the house payments, credit card payments, and living 
expenses, and they had several debts that were more than 180 days delinquent. The 
petition was dismissed in September 2009, because they were unable to make the 
required payments after his wife lost her job. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy is alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a. Recently, they decided to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, but they 
abandoned that course of action when they separated. (GX 2 at 8; Tr. 41-43.) 
 
 Applicant received financial counseling as part of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition. He also contacted a debt consolidation firm in November 2012 but decided that 
it was too expensive. (Tr. 71-72.) 
 
 The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized 
below. 
 
 Home Mortgage Foreclosure (SOR ¶ 1.s – payments on second mortgage 
loan past due for $10,239). Applicant and his third wife decided to buy a home shortly 
after they married. They purchased the home for $203,000, with a $10,000 down 
payment. They had an adjustable rate mortgage, with initial payments of $1,200 per 
month. (Tr. 81-82.) After three years, the interest rate adjusted upward, increasing their 
payments to $1,850, in addition to the $250 per month they were paying on a second 
mortgage loan. They also were paying for furniture for the house and had several credit 
cards. (Tr. 45.) 
 
 In an effort to avoid foreclosure on their home, Applicant and his wife enrolled in 
a “home affordable” plan with another bank and made $1,300 monthly payments for six 
months. At the end of the six months, the bank wanted $23,000, which they could not 
afford. (Tr. 71-72.) The first mortgage was foreclosed and the home was sold for 
$143,000 in August 2012, which was less than the $165,933 they owed. The debt was 
cancelled and Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C documenting the transaction. 
(AX B.) The first mortgage was not alleged in the SOR. The delinquent second 
mortgage is unresolved. (GX 4 at 3.) 
 
 Home Furnishings (SOR ¶ 1.b – judgment for $1,355; SOR ¶ 1.c – judgment 
for $1,926; SOR ¶ 1.n – charged off for $711; SOR ¶ 1.t – charged off for $1,310). 
Applicant and his third wife bought home furnishings on installment plans but were 
unable to make the payments after their adjustable home mortgage payments 
increased. The $711 debt for furniture alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n is being collected by 
garnishment of Applicant’s credit union account. (Tr. 53-54.) The other debts for home 
furnishings are unresolved. 
 
 Delinquent Federal Income Taxes (SOR ¶ 1.d – tax lien for $6,583; SOR ¶ 
1.e – tax lien for $3,642; SOR ¶ 1.q – government debt for $5,504.). The two federal 
income tax liens were filed in 2011, because Applicant could not afford to pay the taxes 
 
4 
 
that were due. In 2011, he negotiated a payment agreement with the IRS for $200 per 
month, but he did not make any payments under the agreement. He has not had any 
contact with the IRS for about a year. (Tr. 56-59; GX 2 at 8.) 
 
 Delinquent State Income Taxes (SOR ¶ 1.z (as amended) – state tax lien for 
$2,322.). This tax lien was filed in March 2003. (GX 3 at 5.) Applicant has taken no 
action to resolve this debt.   
 
 Child Support Arrearage (SOR ¶ 1.r – arrearage of $15,396). Applicant 
testified that he began having difficulty with his child support obligations between 1996 
and 2002. (Tr. 41.) He was required to pay child support for his three children, and he 
accumulated an arrearage of about $15,396. His pay is being garnished to collect the 
child support arrearage, at the rate of $307.46 per week. (AX A at 6.) Three separate 
garnishments are applied to his pay, one for $72.12, one for $152.03, and one for 
$83.31. The first two are applied to the arrearage alleged in the SOR ¶ 1.r. (AX A at 2-
4.)  
 
 Car Repossession (SOR ¶ 1.u – collection account for deficiency of $3,909). 
Applicant’s credit report indicates that this debt was disputed. (GX 3 at 8.) However, 
there is no evidence of the basis for the dispute. The date of last activity on this account 
is September 2008. The debt is unresolved.  
 
 Delinquent Utility Bill (SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $240). This debt 
was referred for collection in March 2012. It is unresolved. 
 
 Medical Debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.m, six debts totaling $1,128 referred for 
collection). Applicant testified that he has medical insurance and these debts are 
copayments for his children’s medical care. The amounts range from $31 to $313 and 
date back to May 2006. (GX 4 at 1-2.) Applicant testified that he contacted the doctor 
who provided the care, but he was referred to the collection agency. (Tr. 68.) He took no 
further action. The debts are unresolved. 
 
 Delinquent Credit Card Accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.o, 1.p, 1.v-1.y, totaling about 
$5,982). These accounts were referred for collection between February and July 2009. 
(GX 3; GX 4.) Applicant testified that he contacted the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.o 
and 1.v, but that they required that payments be deducted directly from his checking 
account. He was unable to negotiate an agreement because he does not have a 
checking account. (Tr. 66-67.) The debts are unresolved.  
 
Applicant has shared a household with his current cohabitant since April 2012.  
They are renting with an option to purchase, and they share household expenses. His 
cohabitant is employed as the registrar of the apprentice school. They met when 
Applicant was readmitted to the apprentice school in January 2012. She and Applicant 
worked together on several committees at the apprentice school, and they became 
personal friends around March or April of 2012. She testified that Applicant has kept 
current with his household financial obligations, even though the child-support 
 
5 
 
garnishment has diminished his income dramatically. She also testified that Applicant 
had been in contact with his creditors in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 
27-33.) 
 
 Applicant’s gross income in 2011 was about $20,000 per year. His pay has 
increased to about $36,000 per year. (Tr. 48-50.) His gross weekly pay is $776. After 
deductions, including the $307 child-support garnishment, his net pay is about $232. He 
testified that his net monthly remainder is about $50. (Tr. 55.) He drives a 15-year-old 
car and has no savings or retirement funds. His pay is deposited to a prepaid debit card 
account. (Tr. 54-56, 81.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
 
6 
 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially 
applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c) are established by Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by 
his credit reports. Applicant and his wife overextended themselves when they bought 
and furnished a home, thereby establishing AG ¶ 19(e). AG ¶ 19(g) is not established, 
because there is no evidence that he failed to timely file his tax returns. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
ongoing, and not the result of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 The first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) (conditions beyond his control) is established by 
evidence of his multiple marital breakups, the upward adjustment of his home mortgage, 
medical expenses incurred by his children, his short periods of unemployment, and his 
wife’s loss of employment. However, the second prong (responsible conduct) is not fully 
established. Applicant and his wife initially acted responsibly when they could not afford 
their mortgage payments. They kept in contact with the lender and attempted to 
rehabilitate their delinquent loan payments. However, Applicant took no action to 
 
8 
 
determine his financial liability after the foreclosure and has done nothing to resolve the 
second mortgage. He contacted his medical provider regarding the medical debts and 
he contacted some of the collection agencies for his delinquent credit card accounts, 
but he has not followed up on his initial efforts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant has received counseling, but his 
financial situation is not under control. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Applicant receives some credit for his efforts to 
prevent foreclosure of his home and his initial efforts to negotiate payment agreements 
with his creditors. However, the only payments he is making on his debts are 
involuntary garnishments. Payment by involuntary garnishment “is not the same as, or 
similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.” ISCR Case No. 09-5700 
(App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant’s credit report reflects that the 
car repossession deficiency alleged in SOR ¶ 1.u is disputed, he admitted the debt in 
his answer to the SOR and he submitted no evidence showing the basis for a dispute. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 A security clearance adjudication is aimed at evaluating an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required, as a matter of law, to 
establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a 
 
9 
 
plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. 
The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR 
be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant 
was sincere and candid at the hearing, but he has no coherent, plausible, and credible 
plan to resolve his financial problems, in spite of being gainfully employed for more than 
nine years.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.z:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
