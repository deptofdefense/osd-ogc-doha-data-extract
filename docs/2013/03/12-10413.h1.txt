GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 11, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
November 1, 2012.2 On December 19, 2012, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to

all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 4, 2013. In a sworn but undated 
statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. It is unclear when Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on February 4, 
2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 5, 2013, and I convened the hearing, 
as scheduled, on February 13, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 22, 2013. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity, and he submitted six additional documents which were marked as exhibits 
(AE J through AE O) that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one (¶ 1.e.) of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of two defense contractors who, since 
October 2009, had served as a full-time armed security officer, and since June 2012, 
had served as a part-time Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) role 
player. He was laid off in September 2012. While he is still employed, he is not 
permitted to work because he needs a security clearance to continue doing so.3 He was 
previously employed by other employers in various positions, including parking valet, 
restaurant busser, order filler, talent escort, and general laborer.4 Applicant has been 
unemployed on several occasions. Although he attempted to enlist in the U.S. Navy, a 
medical condition he had made that impossible, and his request for a medical waiver 
was denied.5 It is unclear if Applicant was ever granted a security clearance, although 
he believes he was granted an interim secret security clearance as well as an 
unspecified authorization for a public trust position to allow him access to the facility

where he works.6 Applicant graduated from high school in June 2000, and attended one 
semester of college in 2001.7 He has never been married, and he has no children. 
 
Financial Considerations 
There apparently was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 
2009. In the years prior to that point, Applicant had a full-time job as well as a part-time 
job, and although the state where he was living was “pricey,” he was able to control his 
finances and pay his bills.8 In 2009, he moved back to his parents’ home to care for his 
mother (she had medical and physical health problems) and assist his father (extensive 
period of unemployment).9 He saved money by residing with his parents at no cost, but 
contributed funds to pay for the family bills.10 As a result of a reduced income and 
increased medical expenses for his mother as well as himself, Applicant exhausted his 
savings to meet monthly living expenses and debt. Accounts became delinquent and 
were either placed for collection or charged off.  
Applicant contacted a number of his creditors and collection agents regarding his 
delinquent accounts, and tried to work out repayment arrangements. He obtained 
financial counseling that included a debt management program, and also set up a 
budget and a repayment schedule reflecting anticipated steps in his repayment plan. 
His plan prioritizes accounts, listing nine accounts, but three other accounts are 
recognized in the plan but not included in it.11 Although the plan calls for specific 
monthly payments, an analysis of Applicant’s income indicated an inability to proceed 
with the payments because of Applicant’s current layoff status.12 Nevertheless, 
Applicant was able to address several accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they 
have either been settled, paid off, or were in the process of being paid.  
In response to the DOD interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial 
statement reflecting a monthly net salary of $1,060; monthly household, utility, 
transportation, and food expenses of $1,150; and monthly debt repayments of $496.22; 
leaving a negative monthly remainder of $586.22.13 Applicant’s income was actually his

unemployment compensation, and he had been using it to make payments on various 
accounts.14  
The SOR identified 19 purportedly continuing delinquencies.15 Those accounts 
can be divided into three separate categories: those already paid off, in the process of 
being resolved, or otherwise already resolved; those debts which Applicant has 
disputed, and the debt has been removed from his credit reports; and those which 
Applicant has placed on his prioritized list to be addressed, but has not yet done so. 
  
In the first category, there is a medical account with an unidentified medical 
provider in the amount of $296 that was placed for collection with one collection agency 
and transferred or sold to another collection agency (SOR & 1.a.).16 Applicant and the 
collection agent agreed upon a settlement amount of $162, and Applicant made his 
initial $80 payment on February 13, 2013, with the final $82 payment scheduled for 
March 7, 2013.17 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a medical account with an unidentified medical provider in the amount of 
$10 that was placed for collection (SOR & 1.e.).18 On November 8, 2012, Applicant paid 
the entire amount.19 The account has been resolved. 
 
There is a medical account with an unidentified medical provider in the amount of 
$206 that was placed for collection (SOR & 1.f.).20 Applicant and the collection agent 
agreed to a repayment plan, and commencing in December 2012, he started making 
$30 monthly payments which are automatically withdrawn from his bank account.21 The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
There are two student loans with a combined total balance of $12,689.29 that 
were placed for collection and subsequently transferred or sold to a collection agent

 Unfortunately, many of the accounts listed in the SOR are referenced solely by abbreviated versions of 
the identities of the creditor or collection agent, with no account number, or a creditor or collection agent identified 
only as “medical payment data” or unidentified creditor or collection agent with either partial or complete account 
numbers. Many of the accounts listed have been transferred or sold to other collection agents or debt purchasers, 
making efforts to identify or track the original creditor that much more difficult. In addition, Applicant’s memory 
regarding various debts was confused, and he mixed debts appearing in the interrogatories with debts appearing in 
the SOR.

(SOR & 1.m.).22 Applicant acknowledged being neglectful in making his monthly $276 
payments,23 and he filed an unemployment deferment request, based on his current 
laid-off status.24 The loans were placed into forbearance, the monthly payments were 
reduced to $141.86, and no payments are required until May 7, 2013.25 With the loans 
in forbearance, they should no longer be reflected in Applicant’s credit reports as in 
collection. These accounts are in the process of being resolved. 
 
In the second category, there is an account with a mobile telephone company in 
the amount of $1,128 that was placed for collection and subsequently transferred or 
sold to a collection agent (SOR & 1.g.).26 Applicant was unaware of the account, as he 
had never received any correspondence regarding it.27 He disputed the account with 
Experian, and it was deleted from his credit report.28 Applicant would be willing to pay 
the account if it could be shown that it is a valid account belonging to him.29 Although 
Experian has deleted the account, Equifax has noted the dispute, but has refused to 
delete it.30 The account is in the process of being resolved, or conceivably already might 
have been resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account in the amount of $656 that was placed for 
collection (SOR & 1.i.), but eventually sold to a factoring company as an account 
receivable.31 Applicant was unaware of the account, as he had never received any 
correspondence regarding it.32 He disputed the account with Experian, and it was 
deleted from his credit report.33 Applicant would be willing to pay the account if it could 
be shown that it is a valid account belonging to him.34 The account is not listed in the 
Equifax credit report.35 The account is in the process of being resolved, or conceivably 
already might have been resolved.

There is an account with the same mobile telephone company as that listed 
above in the amount of $111 that was placed for collection (SOR & 1.j.).36 Applicant was 
unaware of the account, as he had never received any correspondence regarding it.37 
He disputed the account with Experian, and it was deleted from his credit report.38 
Applicant would be willing to pay the account if it could be shown that it is a valid 
account belonging to him.39 The account is not listed in the Equifax credit report.40 The 
account is in the process of being resolved, or conceivably already might have been 
resolved. 
 
There is a credit card account with a high credit of $513 that was placed for 
collection and charged off, and subsequently sold to a debt purchaser (SOR & 1.l.).41 
The debt purchaser increased the high credit to $573, and declared the unpaid balance 
to be $706.42 Applicant disputed the account with Experian, and it was deleted from his 
credit report.43 Applicant would be willing to pay the account if it could be shown that it is 
a valid account belonging to him.44 Although Experian has deleted the account, Equifax 
has merely noted the dispute, but has refused to delete it.45 The account is in the 
process of being resolved, or conceivably already might have been resolved. 
 
There is an unspecified account in the amount of $359 that was placed for 
collection (SOR & 1.q.).46 Applicant is not familiar with the named creditor and plans to 
dispute it.47 Applicant would be willing to pay the account if it could be shown that it is a 
valid account belonging to him.48 The account is not listed in either the Equifax credit 
report, or the most recent combined credit report.49 It is listed only in his August 2011

In the third category are the remaining debts, all of which were placed for 
collection, listed in the SOR: There is a cable or internet account in the amount of $254 
(SOR & 1.b.).51 Applicant contacted the collection agent, but it will not accept periodic 
partial payments, and will only accept one payment for the entire amount.52 There is 
another cable or internet account with the same company, but with a different collection 
agent in the amount of $640 (SOR & 1.c.).53 Applicant contacted the collection agent, 
but it could not find this additional account in Applicant’s name in its records.54 Applicant 
believed this charge was for equipment that he had already turned in to the original 
creditor.55 There is a medical account in the amount of $92 (SOR & 1.d.).56 There is a 
medical account with an identified medical provider in the amount of $767 (SOR & 
1.h.).57 The account is no longer listed in his most recent credit report.58 There is a 
medical account with an unidentified medical provider in the amount of $590 (SOR & 
1.k.),59 that was eventually sold to a factoring company as an account receivable. The 
account is no longer listed in his most recent credit report.60 There is an apartment 
lease account in the amount of $1,695 (SOR & 1.n.).61 When Applicant contacted the 
rental office, it no longer had any records of an account in his name.62 The account is no 
longer listed in his most recent credit reports.63 There is a medical account with an 
unidentified medical provider in the amount of $473 (SOR & 1.o.).64 The account is no 
longer listed in his most recent credit reports.65 There is a medical account with an

Work Performance and Character References 
 
 Applicant’s work performance and character have been described by a senior 
company manager in extremely positive terms. He has been described as mature, 
devoted, dependable, thoughtful, caring, exceptional, and a trusted asset. Applicant was 
the only member of the contract security team to ever win the Commanding General 
Coin of Excellence.72 The Garrison Command Group also described Applicant’s selfless 
service and professionalism.73 The commanding general, a major general, commented 
on Applicant’s dedication and outstanding service, and referred to Applicant as highly 
motivated.74 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”75 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”76

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”77 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.78  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”79 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”80 Thus, nothing

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2009, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties, and over the next few years those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection or sold. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
 
11 
                                      
 
debts.81 In addition, it is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(e) when the individual has 
a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of 
the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) partially apply, and AG ¶ 20(c) applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s continuing and escalating financial 
difficulties since 2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was 
so infrequent.” He initially reduced his expenses by residing with his parents at no cost, 
but contributed funds to pay for the family bills. With reduced income and increased 
medical expenses, Applicant exhausted his savings to meet monthly living expenses 
and debt. Nevertheless, Applicant contacted a number of his creditors and collection 
agents regarding his delinquent accounts, and tried to work out repayment 
arrangements. He disputed those accounts he did not recognize, and several of them 
were deleted from his credit report. He eventually obtained financial counseling that 
included a debt management program, and also set up a budget and a repayment 
schedule reflecting anticipated steps in his repayment plan. However, an analysis of 
Applicant’s income indicated an inability to proceed with the payments because of 
Applicant’s current lay-off status. Nevertheless, he was able to address several 
accounts, including non-SOR accounts, and they have either been settled, paid off, or 
were in the process of being paid. Applicant’s efforts were, unfortunately, thwarted by 
his layoff, and now he is unable to address accounts with his limited unemployment 
compensation. When he returns to full employment, Applicant is prepared to resolve all 
of his remaining accounts, even those that were deleted from his credit reports. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.82 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies. Commencing in 2009, and continuing over the next few 
years, several events, largely beyond his control, occurred that caused him financial 
problems that made it difficult for him to remain current on all of his accounts: his 
mother’s medical condition; his own medical condition; his father’s lengthy period of 
unemployment; Applicant’s repeated periods of unemployment, however brief; and 
Applicant’s layoff in September 2012. As to this last incident, Applicant was making 
                                                          
81
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

good strides in addressing and resolving a number of delinquent accounts when, based 
largely on the contents of a 2011 credit report, he was laid off and unable to continue 
addressing his accounts. It is of some interest that the oldest credit report reflects a 
number of delinquent accounts that found themselves included in the SOR, but those 
same accounts, no longer included in more recent credit reports, remain in the SOR. 
With a reduced income and increased medical expenses, Applicant exhausted his 
savings to meet monthly living expenses and debt. Accounts became delinquent and 
were either placed for collection or sold. Applicant’s indebtedness was not caused by 
frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, 
his financial problems were caused by circumstances largely beyond his control. Under 
the circumstances, while he was admittedly neglectful with respect to his education 
loans which are now in forbearance, Applicant subsequently acted responsibly by 
addressing his delinquent accounts.83  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.84       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or sold.  
                                                          
83
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
84
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant contacted his creditors and collection agents, and sought the assistance of a 
financial counselor. Applicant prioritized his accounts and resolved a number of 
accounts. While he was unable to commence making payments simultaneously on all of 
the accounts, Applicant did attempt to enter into repayment plans with his creditors. The 
initial result was positive. His efforts were made that much more difficult when he was 
laid off. Nevertheless, once he regains full employment, Applicant is prepared to resolve 
those remaining accounts, including those that have been deleted from his credit report, 
as well. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He possesses an excellent 
reputation in the workplace. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:85 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts, 
but his efforts were thwarted by his current layoff. This decision should serve as a 
warning that, upon regaining full employment, his failure to continue his debt resolution 
efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for 
a security clearance.86 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
                                                          
85
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
86
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. DOHA has no authority to 
attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 
2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 
2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
