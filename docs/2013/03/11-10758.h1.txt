LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows he has a
longstanding history of financial problems consisting of five unpaid judgments as well as
five collection or charged-off accounts. He recently completed a loan-modification
program for his mortgage loan, albeit after a judgment in foreclosure was obtained by
the mortgage company. Nevertheless, the five unpaid judgments and five collection and
charged-off accounts are unresolved, and he has only the most general of plans to
resolve them. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the security
concerns stemming from his problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is
decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 1,1
2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F
for financial considerations.
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took
place February 21, 2013. The transcript (Tr.) was received March 4, 2013. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant admits the five unpaid judgments for a total of about $29,489, and the
five collection or charged-off accounts for a total of about $7,781, as alleged in the
SOR. His admissions are accepted and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In
addition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 43-year-old program analyst for a company engaged in defense
contracting. He has had this job since March 2011, and he has a good employment
record there as verified by three letters of recommendation.  He is seeking to obtain a2
security clearance for the first time, and he completed a security clearance application
in May 2011.  In doing so, he disclosed a number of derogatory financial accounts. 3
Applicant has been continuously employed since at least July 2002.  He worked4
as a salesman during 2002–2006; had a part-time delivery job during 2009–2010; and
as a contract administrator during 2006–2011. His annual salary as a program analyst
was $62,500 in 2012 and is $64,000 in 2013. His spouse earns about $39,000 annually
working as a purchasing manager for manufacturing company. His educational
background includes a high school diploma and some college. His first marriage was
relatively brief and ended in divorce in 1998. He married his current spouse in 2002. He
has two children in his household, a 17-year-old stepson and a 6-year-old daughter.

Applicant has a longstanding history of financial problems, which he does not
dispute. His problematic financial history is confirmed by the documentary exhibits,
which show, among other things, that the five unpaid judgments were taken against him
during 2006–2010.  He attributes his financial problems to periods of unemployment5
and underemployment.  He was laid off from a job in 2001, and his spouse was laid off6
twice in the last ten years or so. In addition, although employed during 2002-2006, he
earned less than he had in the past. As a result, he overextended on credit and incurred
debts he could not afford to repay, to include falling behind on his mortgage loan.
Applicant defaulted on the mortgage loan in 2011, and the mortgage company
obtained a judgment in foreclosure in July 2012.  Notwithstanding the foreclosure7
judgment, Applicant and his family remained in the house and he kept working with the
mortgage company to resolve the situation. After completing a three-month trial period
during October–December 2012, the mortgage company agreed to modify the mortgage
loan, and Applicant is now in good standing.  8
Applicant presented documentary evidence that he paid (by garnishment of
wages) two judgments that were not alleged in the SOR.  One judgment was released9
in September 2008 and the second was released in December 2010.  
Applicant has not paid, settled, entered into repayment agreements, or otherwise
resolved any of the debts in the SOR.  With that said, he made payments, again by10
garnishment of wages, on the unpaid judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a.  The payments ended in11
2011, when he left his previous employer and the garnishment did not follow him to his
current employer. Likewise, he made no effort with that particular creditor to resume the
garnishment or initiate some other repayment option. He explained that his plan, now
that the mortgage loan is current, is to contact the creditors, likely starting with the
smallest debts first, and try to take care of them as quickly as he is able.  To that end,12
he has a positive cash flow of about $900 monthly to use for debt repayment.  13

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As14
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt15
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An16
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  17
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting18
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An19
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate20
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme21
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.24
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 25
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant26
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it24
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant25
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline26
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  27
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. His unfavorable financial history indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The28 29
facts are more than sufficient to establish these disqualifying conditions.

Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally

There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F.  Based on the30
evidence before me, none of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to fully mitigate the
security concerns. In particular, AG ¶ 20(b) is not sufficient because the periods of
unemployment and underemployment took place years ago and cannot be relied upon
to explain the current circumstances. AG ¶ 20(c) is not sufficient because he has not
received any financial counseling and there are not clear indications that his financial
problems are resolved or under control. He does deserve credit for successfully
modifying his mortgage loan just a few months ago. Understandably, that was a high-
priority item. With that said, AG ¶ 20(d) is not sufficient because, overall, he has not
made a good-faith effort to repay his indebtedness. I also note that paying on the
judgments by garnishments is not a good-faith effort because it was involuntary on his
part.  31
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather,32
the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases,
the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.33
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).34

Here, the evidence fails to establish that Applicant has established a plan to
resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.
Applicant stated he has a general plan to address his debts starting with the smallest
debt first. He offered no details or specifics because he had none. Likewise, he has had
zero communication with his creditors. Given these circumstances, I assess his
generalized plan as speculative and unrealistic as opposed to a reasonable plan with
follow-on actions. To sum up, Applicant has not established a documented track record
of remedial actions sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under the Appeal Board’s
standard.
Applicant’s longstanding history of financial problems raises doubts about his
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the
whole-person concept.  Having done so, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his34
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.j: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
