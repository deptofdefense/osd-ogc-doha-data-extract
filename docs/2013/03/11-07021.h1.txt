MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant and his spouse, who have seven children all living at home, took on a 
sizeable mortgage in 2005 that they struggled to pay on time. In December 2010, the 
servicer for their mortgage foreclosed. Applicant has been contesting the foreclosure in 
court since 2011, contending that the loan servicer had no security interest as of a January 
14, 2008 tax sale. Applicant has yet to resolve a $1,205 credit card debt past due since 
2006 or a $20,326 personal line of credit balance delinquent since January 2009, and he 
was behind on his utility bills as of late December 2012. Even if his challenge to the 
foreclosure is successful, he has yet to demonstrate that he can handle his financial 
obligations responsibly. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On July 19, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the 
 
 
 2 
national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD took the 
action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant’s secret-level security clearance was revoked for failure to file a timely 
response. On September 27, 2012, he asked the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) to reopen his case. He missed the deadline to respond. His request was granted, 
and on October 2, 2012, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. 
 
On December 4, 2012, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On January 3, 2013, I issued a notice scheduling a 
hearing for January 23, 2013. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Before any evidence was introduced, 
Department Counsel stipulated that the debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b had been paid by 
Applicant. Eight Government exhibits (GEs 1-8) and six Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F) were 
admitted without objection. Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received 
on January 31, 2013. At Applicant’s request, I held the record open initially for two weeks 
for Applicant to submit additional documentation, including about the foreclosure of his 
mortgage. On February 20, 2013, Applicant requested an extension, until March 1, 2013, 
which was granted without objection. 
 
On March 1, 2013, Applicant submitted a letter from the attorney handling his 
challenge to the mortgage foreclosure. The exhibit was admitted as AE G without 
objection. In his forwarding correspondence, Applicant indicated that he had requested 
additional information from the attorney. I extended the deadline to March 12, 2013, for any 
further submissions, but no additional exhibits were received. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of February 28, 2012, Applicant owed 
two medical debts in collection, of $139 (SOR 1.a) and $100 (SOR 1.b). As of July 19, 
2012, he owed a $1,205 credit card debt (SOR 1.c) and a $20,326 past-due loan balance 
(SOR 1.d). Applicant was also allegedly in debt (amount not listed in SOR) on a mortgage 
account foreclosed in November 2011 [sic] (SOR 1.e). When he answered the SOR, 
Applicant indicated that he still owed the debts in SOR 1.a-1.c. The loans in SOR 1.d and 
1.e were in legal proceedings. He acknowledged that he and his family “do tend to live 
beyond [their] means for the most part,” and that a few minor setbacks had caused them 
“to play catch up.” After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the 
following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old high school graduate with some technical training. (GE 1; 
Tr. 38.) He served on active duty in the U.S. military from June 1985 to July 1991, and he 
 
 3 
held a secret-level security clearance. He then served in the National Guard from August 
1991 to November 1994. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 44.) From November 1996 to June 2002, Applicant 
worked as a production coordinator for a commercial radiation systems company. For the 
next six months to a year, he worked as a laborer/carpenter’s apprentice for a local 
builder.
1 
Since May 2003, he has been employed with a secret clearance by a defense 
contractor, initially as a production control planner and since July 2008 as a configuration 
management analyst. In January 2006, Applicant enlisted in a different branch of the 
Guard from his previous Guard service. He has continued to serve part-time (one weekend 
per month and 15 additional days per year) while holding his full-time job with the defense 
contractor. (GEs 1, 5; Tr. 45.) 
 
Applicant and his first wife divorced in July 1989 after a short-lived marriage. They 
had one son, who was born in February 1988. In March 1991, Applicant married his current 
spouse. Applicant and his second wife have seven children, who range in age from 8 to 21, 
and live with them. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 39.) Their 21-year-old son is taking off a semester from 
college and working. Their 19-year-old son has not yet started college due to a medical 
condition. His medication costs them between $100 and $150 a month. (Tr. 40-41.) 
 
 In October 2001, Applicant and his spouse bought their home. They took on a 
$147,584 mortgage, to be repaid at $952 per month. They made their payments on time. 
Around October 2003, they took out a construction loan of $58,000 to add on to their home 
because of their growing family.
2
 (GEs 5, 7; Tr. 25.) 
 
 On starting his work with his current employer, Applicant completed and certified a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on May 2, 2003. Concerning the financial record 
inquiries, Applicant responded affirmatively to any wage garnishments within the last seven 
years. He disclosed that his wages had been garnisheed around July 1998 for $4,550 in 
child support debt. (GE 3.) He was granted his secret clearance in June 2003. (GE 1.) 
 
Around late 2004, their mortgage lender was being sold to another financial 
institution that refused to grant a mortgage to Applicant and his spouse. In February 2005, 
Applicant and his spouse took out a home loan of $264,247, at an interest rate over 12% 
(SOR 1.e). (Tr. 53.) The loan payments were around $2,154 per month. In June 2005, 
Applicant and his spouse opened a line of credit with their mortgage lender (SOR 1.d) for 
home improvements. (GE 7.)  
 
                                                 
1
Applicant provided discrepant dates for his employment as a laborer. On his May 2003 SF 86, Applicant 
indicated that he worked as a carpenter’s helper from May 2002 to December 2012 and had been unemployed 
since then. (GE 3.) On his January 2006 SF 86, Applicant listed his employment as a laborer/carpenter’s 
assistant from June 18, 2002 until May 4, 2003. (GE 2.) 
 
2
Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in February 2011 that he and his 
spouse obtained the construction loan in 2005. (GE 5.) Applicant’s January 2011 credit report lists a mortgage 
loan of unspecified amount taken out in October 2003 and paid in February 2005. The amount then due on the 
loan may well have been included in their new mortgage, which was separate from the personal line of credit 
in SOR 1.d. (GE 7.) 
 
 4 
On January 17, 2006, Applicant completed and certified a Security Clearance 
Application (SF 86). Applicant responded negatively to the financial record inquiries, and 
his secret clearance was renewed in June 2006. (GE 2.) 
 
As of July 2006, Applicant was in default on student loan debt of $4,417 from 1998 
for his technical schooling. (GE 5.) Despite the additional income from his Guard duty, 
around July 2006 Applicant stopped paying on a $1,050 revolving charge balance with a 
merchandise retailer, and in November 2007 $1,057 was placed for collection. He settled 
the account for less than the full balance in August 2009. Around November 2006, 
Applicant stopped making any payments on another credit card account (SOR 1.c). As of 
June 2008, a past-due balance of $1,205 was in collection. In November 2007, a medical 
provider placed a $100 debt for collection (SOR 1.b). Around August 2010, Applicant paid 
off a $917 jewelry debt after it had been charged off in December 2007. (GE 7.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse paid their mortgage on time for the first two years. After 
they missed paying one month, they began to be chronically late 30 days. (GE 5.)  Also, 
Applicant’s January 2011 credit report shows that their line of credit became delinquent 
(SOR 1.d) and was charged off in January 2009.
3
 (GE 7.) Around March 2009, Applicant’s 
spouse was in a car accident that left her unable to work for two months. According to 
Applicant, they fell behind a couple of months in their mortgage payment, and subsequent 
attempts to pay their mortgage were refused. The town filed a tax lien against his property 
for failure to pay property taxes around $4,000.
4
 (GE 5; Tr. 22.) In April 2010, his spouse 
had a second car accident, which aggravated an injury suffered in her earlier accident. She 
was out of work for another month, and Applicant and his spouse stopped all attempts to 
pay the mortgage. Around December 2010, their mortgage lender (SOR 1.e) foreclosed. 
(GEs 5, 7; Tr. 26.) Applicant retained legal counsel to contest the foreclosure, at a retainer 
fee of $6,000. (GE 5; AE G; Tr. 46.) 
 
Applicant informed his civilian employer about the foreclosure. (Tr. 23.) On 
December 10, 2010, Applicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He responded affirmatively to several of the financial 
record inquiries concerning, in the last seven years, whether he had any property 
foreclosed on; had defaulted on any loan; had any bills or debts turned over for collection; 
                                                 
3 
Applicant testified that his spouse took out the line of credit. (Tr. 28.) However, Applicant’s January 2011 
credit report shows it as a joint account. (GE 7.) He also testified that they stopped paying on the line of credit 
in November or December 2010, on the advice of the attorney retained to contest the foreclosure of their 
mortgage. (Tr. 29.) When confronted with the evidence showing that the line of credit account was closed and 
charged off in January 2009, more than a year before his mortgage lender initiated foreclosure of his home 
loan, Applicant responded that he was “not certain.” He did not explain what caused them to default on the line 
of credit.  He received no information that the line of credit had been sold or transferred from the lender in 
SOR 1.d. (Tr. 30.) 
 
4 Applicant testified that they fell behind in their mortgage payments due to car accidents and family medical 
bills. Subsequent mortgage payments were returned to them by the lender, and around that time, the lien was 
sold. Applicant speculates that since the mortgage lender no longer held the lien, it may have led the lender to 
refuse the payments. (Tr. 22.) Applicant is legally contesting the December 2010 foreclosure of their mortgage 
on the basis that the lender’s security interest was extinguished by a tax sale occurring on January 14, 2008. 
(AE G.) It is unclear whether the tax sale caused the mortgage lender to refuse their payments. 
 
 5 
had his wages garnished; or had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts. Also, 
Applicant answered “yes” to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debts. Applicant disclosed that his wages were garnished by the IRS for a $1,400 tax debt 
satisfied in October 2010. Applicant listed outstanding delinquent balances of $19,128.41 
on the line of credit (SOR 1.d) and $300,000 on his foreclosed mortgage (SOR 1.e), but 
that he was legally contesting the foreclosure action. (GE 1.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on January 14, 2011, showed the default of the 
mortgage and the personal line of credit loans, which were reported to have zero balances 
because of the foreclosure and charge off. Applicant reportedly owed previously 
undisclosed collection balances of $1,205 to the creditor identified in SOR 1.c, $3,366 in 
student loan debt (not in SOR), and $239 in medical debt (SOR 1.a and 1.b). (GE 7.)  
 
On February 3, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about his finances. He maintained he paid his 
mortgage on time until he fell one month behind. Subsequent mortgage payments were 
always one month late. The lender refused to refinance to allow him to bring his mortgage 
current. Then, after his spouse’s car accidents, his debt “snowballed.” He had a hard time 
paying his mortgage and line of credit loans after the spring of 2010. Foreclosure 
proceedings were initiated around September 2010, and he and his wife then retained 
legal counsel to file suit against the lender to rescind the foreclosure. Applicant indicated 
that he was advised by his attorney to remain in the house pending resolution of his 
lawsuit. Applicant admitted that he had previously received an invoice showing a $232,000 
balance on the loan. Applicant volunteered that two liens had been placed on the property: 
 a $3,200 lien filed by a lumber company that he paid, and a $4,000 lien by the town for 
property taxes, which was paid by the state’s housing authority for him. Confronted about 
the unreported $1,205 credit card debt (SOR 1.c), Applicant averred that he incurred the 
costs for construction supplies for the addition on his home, but he thought the balance 
had been paid. He indicated that he made payments on his student loan, then deferred it, 
and subsequently paid it. Applicant did not recognize the two medical debts, of $139 (SOR 
1.a) and $100 (SOR 1.b) in collection. Applicant reported net household income of $7,075 
and expenses of $2,200 monthly. He and his spouse were paying nothing on the line of 
credit or the mortgage due to the foreclosure. While his spouse was currently handling their 
bills, he intended to become more involved. His spouse, who suffers from depression, 
sometimes forgets to pay the bills. (GE 5.) 
 
Applicant and his family remained in their home for about one year without paying 
anything toward the mortgage. Around early 2012, Applicant and his spouse began making 
court-ordered payments of $1,000 a month to their mortgage lender’s attorney so that they 
could continue to occupy the house until their case is resolved. Applicant has no answer for 
what happened to the approximately $24,000 in extra household income available during 
the year that they made no mortgage payments. His spouse was handling their finances at 
the time. (Tr. 48-49, 52.) 
 
As of late February 2012, Equifax Information Services was reporting outstanding 
collection balances of $139 (SOR 1.a) and $100 (SOR 1.b) for medical services; $385 
 
 6 
(listed as authorized user, unpaid since December 2010) and $1,205 (SOR 1.c) in credit 
card debt; and $628 in student loan debt. (GE 6.) By way of interrogatories forwarded to 
Applicant on February 29, 2012, DOHA asked Applicant to document any progress on 
these debts, on the foreclosed mortgage and line of credit loans (SOR 1.d and 1.e), and on 
any liens or unpaid taxes related to the foreclosure. (GE 5.) 
 
In March 2012, Applicant took out an auto loan of $6,655, to be repaid at $405 per 
month.
5
 (GE 8.) He purchased a 2002 model-year sedan, and for the most part, has paid 
the loan on time. (Tr. 59.)  
 
On April 27, 2012, Applicant informed DOHA that he did not owe any liens or sewer 
taxes. He provided documentation showing that he had paid off his student loan on 
February 23, 2012. He asserted that he had paid the two medical debts on April 26, 2012. 
Concerning the credit card debt in SOR 1.c, he paid $100 and had arranged to pay $200 a 
month in bi-weekly payments. About the foreclosure of his mortgage, Applicant explained 
that he and his spouse had insurance that required the lender to add missed payments to 
the end of their loan. Yet the lender refused to honor the clause and refused to accept 
payments from them. Concerning the status of his lawsuit, Applicant explained that 
motions had yet to be filed in court. He was paying $1,000 per month to occupy the house.
6
 
He admitted he and his spouse were making no payments on the line of credit balance of 
$20,326, reportedly on the advice of their attorney (“stopped paying line of credit when 
advised to by our attorney in November 2010”). Applicant completed a personal financial 
statement on which he reported net monthly income of $1,091.82 after paying monthly 
household expenses of $4,600 and debt payments of $1,472 ($100 on SOR 1.c, $1,000 to 
pay for continued occupancy of the house, and $372 on an auto loan). He and his spouse 
had reportedly “tried credit counseling.” (GE 5.) 
 
Applicant was away from home and work for National Guard training from May 2, 
2012 to June 27, 2012. (Tr. 67.) On July 19, 2012, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant 
because of the $239 in medical debt (SOR 1.a and 1.b), the $1,205 past-due credit card 
account (SOR 1.c), the $20,326 balance on the defaulted personal line of credit loan (SOR 
1.d), and the foreclosure of his mortgage (SOR 1.e). When he responded to the SOR on 
October 2, 2012, Applicant indicated that his debts had not yet been resolved. The 
payment to satisfy the medical debt in SOR 1.a had apparently been returned for 
insufficient funds.

5 
According to Applicant’s credit report (GE 8.), the monthly term is $405. In his budget prepared in January 
2013, Applicant indicated they had a car payment of $360. (AE B.) 
 
6 
Applicant started making the payments around early 2012. (Tr. 48.) 
 
7 
Applicant indicated that after he received the SOR, he discovered that the payments for the medical debts in 
SOR 1.a and 1.b were returned for lack of funds. Applicant’s January 22, 2013 credit report (GE 8.) shows the 
medical debt in SOR 1.b as paid after collection with a date of last activity in April 2012. In contrast, the $139 
medical debt in SOR 1.a was reported as an unpaid collection balance as of December 2012. There is 
evidence to indicate that the check cleared in April 2012 for the $100 payment. 
 
 
 7 
As of mid-December 2012, Applicant and his spouse owed past-due debt of 
$122.56 for natural gas, $834.58 for electricity,
8
 and $118.16 for cable services. (AE D.) 
Since February 2012, three new medical debts, of $155, $152, and $205 had been placed 
for collection and were unpaid. (GE 8.) Applicant testified he was not familiar with the $155 
medical debt. The other two debts, which had been paid down to $15 and $6, belonged to 
his19-year-old son, who was paying them out of his unemployment check. (Tr. 57-58.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse currently have only one vehicle, the 2002 model-year car 
on which they are making monthly payments. They were looking at another car but were 
not certain what they were going to do as of late January 2013. (Tr. 72.) 
 
As of January 11, 2013, Applicant had satisfied the $125 and $138.60 medical debts 
in the SOR. (AE C.) He was repaying a loan from his 401(k) at $49.73 per month. (AE F.) 
As of March 12, 2013, Applicant had not resolved the debt in SOR 1.c. He testified that the 
initial $100 payment cleared, but he did not follow through on his verbal commitment to 
make the subsequent payments. He left for training and his spouse did not make the 
payments. (Tr. 66-67.) In recent contacts with the creditor, the lender wanted a lump sum 
payment of $300, which Applicant apparently did not have. (Tr. 55.) Applicant was making 
no payments on the personal line of credit (SOR 1.d) in collection, reportedly on the advice 
of legal counsel. Applicant made no effort to contact the assignee currently handling the 
debt. (Tr. 56-57.) His legal challenge to the foreclosure of his mortgage (SOR 1.e) was still 
pending with no documented progress. He has been told that the court was waiting for the 
federal government to take a position about the foreclosure crisis and that cases would be 
dealt with one by one. (Tr. 47.) Applicant is seeking rescission of the foreclosure sale and a 
modification of his mortgage.
9
 (AE G.) He is not clear on who may hold a lien on his 
foreclosed home. (Tr. 24.) 
 
Applicant’s take-home pay from his defense contractor employment is around 
$3,800 per month. As an E-6 training sergeant, he takes home $434.20 per month from the 
National Guard. (AEs B, F; Tr. 46.) His spouse is paid $17.29 per hour for her work at a 
local hospital. Her monthly net income may be less than the estimated $1,360. (AE B.) A 
recent earnings statement showed net pay of $554.56 for 44.1 hours during a two-week 
period. (AE F.) As of January 2013, Applicant estimated net household income at $5,594, 
their recurring monthly expenses at $3,583.18, spending money at $1,600, and $50 in 
savings, for a net discretionary income of $411.02.
10
 Applicant pays $235 per month for 
                                                 
8 
Applicant’s electric bill issued December 20, 2012, showed previous balances totaling $834.58 and current 
charges of $148.75 for a total of $983.33. (AE D.) Actual electric use history shows that the family used 
considerably less electricity in the previous four months (August through November 2012) than in December. It 
may reasonably be inferred that the charge for each of those months was less than $148.75 per month. So, 
Applicant and his spouse have been behind for some time in their payments. 
 
9 
In a letter dated February 26, 2013, Applicant’s attorney confirmed that Applicant and his spouse are required 
to pay $1,000 in use and occupancy payments monthly during the pendency of their challenge to the 
foreclosure sale. The attorney was silent on the issue of any advice to Applicant about the personal line of 
credit, including whether or not to make any payments on the loan. 
  
10
Applicant did not explain what the $1,600 in spending money covers. For example, it is unclear whether 
it includes the estimated $800 in annual out-of-pocket medical expenses.
 
 
 8 
five cell phones, although his two older sons contribute $50 per month each to the cost. 
(Tr. 70.) Applicant estimates that the family’s out-of-pocket medical expenses total at least 
$800 annually. (Tr. 42.) Applicant’s spouse previously took sole responsibility for handling 
the family’s finances because of his poor record in doing so in the past. Around September 
2012, Applicant became involved in the family’s finances (“I got more in tune once I had 
everything scared out of me, so to speak.”). (Tr. 22-23, 63-64.) 
 
Applicant has proved to be a hard-working, dedicated employee and a team player 
for his current employer. As a quality analyst, Applicant developed an outstanding 
reputation among management and co-workers. He takes pride in his work, often going 
“above and beyond,” and working late nights and weekends as necessary. (AE A.) 
 
Applicant’s commander in the National Guard for the past 2.5 years has similarly 
found Applicant to be a reliable team member, who can be depended on to take the 
initiative and deliver on his commitments. Applicant volunteered to take on the challenge of 
transitioning from the unit’s logistics team to being unit training monitor. He has exhibited 
“strong, directional guidance” to Guard members and been open and honest when 
communicating with subordinates, peers, and superiors. (AE A.) Applicant has committed 
no security violations with the defense contractor or with the National Guard. (Tr. 61.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
 
 9 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant has a record of financial delinquencies, despite steady income with a 
defense contractor since late May 2003 and National Guard income since January 2006. A 
$1,205 credit card debt was placed for collection in 2006. Medical debts of $100 and $139 
were placed for collection. Applicant and his spouse more than doubled their monthly 
mortgage payment when they took on a $264,247 mortgage in February 2005. Chronically 
behind 30 days in their payment after 2006, they paid nothing on their loan for a couple of 
months in 2009, and stopped any payments after April 2010. Their mortgage lender 
eventually foreclosed on the loan in late 2010. The evidence also shows that a personal 
line of credit was charged off in January 2009. As of April 2012, the account had a past-
due balance of $20,326. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 
19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” are established. 
 
Concerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply, given the unresolved 
mortgage, personal line of credit loan, and the credit card delinquency in SOR 1.c. Should 
 
 10 
Applicant and his spouse prevail in having the foreclosure rescinded and their mortgage 
modified, it is unclear whether it would negate any or all of their legal liability for the 
personal line of credit loan. As for the credit card delinquency, Applicant told DOHA in April 
2012 that he sent a $100 payment and arranged to pay $200 per month. He admitted at his 
hearing that he did not follow through on his commitment to the creditor after the initial 
$100 payment. 
 
 Applicant experienced some circumstances that could implicate mitigating condition 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under 
the circumstances.” His spouse had two car accidents, in March 2009 and April 2010, 
which left her unable to work for two months in 2009 and one month in 2010. She received 
temporary disability pay when she was out of work, but it was not enough for them to meet 
their financial obligations. (Tr. 51.) Also, Applicant and his spouse pay around $800 per 
year in out-of-pocket, non-discretionary medical expenses for the family. 
 
 Applicant demonstrated financial irresponsibility in several aspects that is not 
mitigated by AG ¶ 20(b), however. Available credit information shows that Applicant and his 
spouse stopped paying on their personal line of credit in 2009 (SOR 1.d) (GE 7.), well 
before the mortgage lender foreclosed on their home and they retained legal counsel to 
fight the foreclosure. The evidence does not substantiate that the default occurred because 
of legal advice from his attorney not to make any payments, even if their current disregard 
of the debt is on such legal advice. A breach of the mortgage contract by the lender would 
not explain or justify their default on the personal line of credit, which was a separate loan 
not secured by the house. (Tr. 56.) Applicant was also not proactive in dealing with the 
debts in SOR 1.a-1.c. Applicant learned during his interview with the OPM investigator in 
February 2011 that the medical debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b, the credit card debt in SOR 1.c, 
and his student loan debt
11
 were all in collection. He knew that his spouse has “bouts of 
depression and forgets to pay bills sometimes.” Yet, he did not take an active role in 
handling the family’s finances until after he received the SOR.  Moreover, Applicant and his 
spouse made no mortgage payments between April 2010 and early 2012, when they 
began paying $1,000 per month in use and occupancy fees under a court order. The 
                                                 
11
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under 
Directive Section 6.3. 
  
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 
24, 2003)). I have considered the student loan default, payment by insufficient funds check, and current 
delinquent balances on utility bills for the five above purposes, and not for any other purpose.   
 
 
 11 
Government has legitimate concerns about what happened to the monthly income that was 
not going toward housing in 2011 and was not applied to their outstanding delinquencies. 
 
 Mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” speak to efforts to address the financial issues. In 
February 2012, Applicant paid off his student loan debt. In April 2012, he satisfied the $100 
medical debt in SOR 1.b. He paid the $139 medical debt in SOR 1.a in January 2013. The 
resolution of these debts after collection is not enough to fully mitigate the financial 
concerns under AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d). Around July or August 2012, Applicant learned 
that the check to pay off the medical debt in SOR 1.a had been returned.  He failed to 
explain the delay in resolving that delinquent debt, which he knew was of concern to the 
DOD. As of January 2013, Applicant’s household budget showed discretionary income of 
$411 per month, after paying monthly recurrent bills, food costs, gasoline, entertainment, 
home and auto repairs, and $1,600 in other, unspecified spending. The $600 in estimated 
grocery costs may well be low, given the size of his family. Based on his budget, he should 
have been able to afford the $300 lump sum payment demanded by the lender in SOR 1.c 
to settle that debt. Recent monthly statements for utilities show past-due balances for 
natural gas, electricity, and cable. Of the $983.33 billed on December 20, 2012, by their 
electricity supplier, $834.58 was past due with no payment received during the previous 
billing period. Although Applicant and his spouse “tried” credit counseling, concerns persist 
about whether they can live within their means. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) applies if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
Applicant was given time after the hearing to document the basis for  his dispute over the 
mortgage foreclosure, to show his payments of $1,000 per month for use and occupancy, 
and to corroborate that his ongoing disregard of the personal line of credit is on the advice 
of legal counsel. In a letter of February 26, 2013, Applicant’s lawyer confirmed that a 
complaint is pending in superior court challenging the mortgage lender’s standing to 
foreclose on the property in that its security interest was extinguished by a tax sale 
occurring on January 14, 2008. The attorney also corroborated that Applicant was ordered 
to pay use and occupancy payments, currently at $1,000 per month. No documentation 
was presented of the tax sale, of the mortgage contract, or of the terms of the personal line 
of credit loan that could substantiate a likelihood of Applicant prevailing on the merits or 
that the personal line of credit had been subsumed into the mortgage. It is unclear whether 
Applicant has a reasonable dispute with the mortgage lender, or even if resolution of the 
mortgage would affect the personal line of credit. The evidence is insufficient to fully 
establish AG ¶ 20(e). 
 
 
 12 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
12
 
 
Applicant has been an “extraordinarily hard working and dedicated employee” for his 
defense contractor employer as well as a committed, professional member of the National 
Guard. Honest in his communications and possessing personal integrity, Applicant 
informed his civilian employer about the foreclosure. His candor weighs favorably in 
assessing whether he can be counted on to fulfill the fiduciary obligations of a security 
clearance. At the same time, I cannot ignore Applicant’s record of irresponsibility with 
regard to handling his personal financial obligations. While his and his spouse’s decision to 
construct an addition to their home is understandable, given their large family, they took on 
a larger mortgage than they could reasonably afford in February 2005, as evidenced by the 
accounts charged off or placed for collection before her first accident in March 2009 (the 
credit card in SOR 1.c, the personal line of credit in SOR 1.d, his student loan, a $917 
jewelry store debt, and a $1,057 revolving retail charge debt). They were chronically late in 
their mortgage payments, and the lender foreclosed around December 2010. 
 
Applicant had his spouse handle their bills, and he knew little about their finances as 
of his interview with the OPM investigator in February 2011. He assumed that the credit 
card debt in SOR 1.c and his student loan had been paid. He did not recognize the medical 
debts in SOR 1.a and 1.b. Placed on notice of these collection debts at that time, Applicant 
had an obligation to determine their validity and resolve them. While he paid off his student 
loan in February 2012, he has largely been reactive in addressing the financial issues. He 
returned from his Guard training in late June 2012, and there is little evidence of efforts on 
his part to become involved in the household finances until after the SOR was issued. Even 
then, he made no payment of the relatively small medical debt in SOR 1.a until January 
2013. He and his spouse were months behind in their electric bill as of December 2012, 
and some new medical debts were in collection. 
 
Some of the financial stress can be explained by the expense of having to care for 
seven children at home, including one son with ongoing medication costs.  Applicant 
appears to live modestly. He is not relying on consumer credit for routine purchases. He 
bought a used car for $6,655 in March 2012. Applicant is not required to satisfy all his 
debts to be considered eligible for a security clearance. Yet, the extent and nature of his 
                                                 
12
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
 
 13 
outstanding delinquencies make it difficult to conclude that his financial problems are safely 
behind him. Should the foreclosure be rescinded and the mortgage terms modified to an 
affordable monthly payment, Applicant may in the future be able to demonstrate the 
financial responsibility required of a clearance holder. Based on the record before me, I am 
unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s security clearance at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
