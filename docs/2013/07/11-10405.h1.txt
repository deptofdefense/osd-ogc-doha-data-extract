DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 15, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action 
was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not find under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security 
clearance. On March 19, 2013, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.

This case was assigned to me on April 16, 2013. The Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on May 3, 2013. 
The hearing was held as scheduled on June 6, 2013. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 that were admitted into evidence without 
objection. GE 2 contained documents marked as Tabs A though L. The Government’s 
list of exhibits was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant testified and offered 
exhibits (AE) A through K that were admitted into evidence without objection. The 
record was initially left open for submission of additional matters until June 20, 2013, 
and, as reflected in HE 2, later extended to July 3, 2013. Applicant subsequently 
submitted emails and documents that were marked as AE L through S and admitted into 
evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on June 13, 
2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old executive assistant who works for a defense 
contractor. She has worked for that contractor since October 2010. She graduated from 
high school in 1979 and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1993. She has been married and 
divorced twice. Her latest divorce was granted in 2005. She has two daughters, ages 17 
and 24. Her oldest daughter serves in the U.S. Marine Corps. Her youngest daughter 
resides with her father. Applicant is not required to pay child support. She has held a 
security clearance since about 1988 without incident.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 15 delinquent debts totaling $52,367 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a – 1.o) and that she received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in December 
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.p). In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven allegations 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.p); claimed two allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.j) 
were duplicates of SOR ¶ 1.a; denied three allegations (SOR 1.e, 1.m and 1.o); and 
claimed she could neither admit or deny four allegations (SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.n) 
due to lack of knowledge of them. Her admissions are incorporated as findings as fact.2 
 
In January 2007, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy following her latest 
divorce. The bankruptcy petition reflected that her total assets were $24,675 and her 
total liabilities were $78,810. Her monthly income at that time was $2,317 and her 
monthly expenditures were $1,867. Under the Chapter 13 plan, she made payments of 
$451 per month. In December 2008, her bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 
proceeding. In March 2009, she was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. She 
indicated that she made all of the payments under the Chapter 13 plan until the 
proceeding was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.3

In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed her current financial problems to a 
divorce and to being laid off for 11 months from June 2009 to May 2010. By using the 
term “divorce” in her Answer to the SOR, she was most likely referring to a later child 
support/custody settlement agreement in about March 2010. She was responsible for 
half of the legal fees, i.e., $2,250, incurred for that agreement. In about February 2011, 
she had $356 garnished from her pay every two weeks until those legal fees were paid.4  
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she was working with a debt 
consolidation company to resolve her delinquent debts. She entered into an agreement 
with that company in June 2012 and was initially paying the company $150 every two 
weeks. She stated that they later increased her payments to $200 every two weeks and 
then to $300. At the same time, they also increased their fees. She provided 
documentation showing she made regular payments to the company. She also stated 
that the company was supposed to make settlement arrangements with a medical 
creditor in about July 2012, but apparently failed to do so. She was served later with a 
summons to appear in court for a legal action concerning that medical debt. She 
contacted the debt consolidation company about the summons and was informed the 
company would take care of it. The debt consolidation company apparently failed to 
take any action and a judgment of $467 was entered against her for that medical debt, 
which was not alleged in the SOR. As a result of the increased fees and the medical 
judgment, Applicant became dissatisfied with the debt consolidation company and 
terminated her debt consolidation program about 45 days before the hearing.5 
 
The status of the alleged debts at the time of the hearing is reflected in the 
following table:

SOR ¶ 1.a – 
judgment 
$3,000 This account was a personal loan 
that Applicant acquired in April 2009 
to purchase furniture. The judgment 
was filed in November 2010. In 2011, 
she entered in to a settlement 
agreement with the creditor, but was 
unable to make those payments. In 
February 2013, she again entered 
into a settlement agreement to pay 
$50 a month to resolve this debt. She 
provided no proof of any payments 
on this debt.

Applicant provided proof that she either paid off or was making payments on four 
other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. Those payments were made through the 
debt consolidation company.7  
 
In her post-hearing submission, Applicant presented documents showing that 
she again filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy on June 13, 2013. She received credit 
counseling prior to filing both bankruptcies. Her latest bankruptcy petition reflected that 
her total assets were $21,881 and her total liabilities were $55,477. Her current net 
monthly income was $2,894 and her currently monthly expenditures were $2,648. 
Under her proposed Chapter 13 plan, she will make 60 monthly payments. The 
payments will increase over time. They will be $246 starting in July 2013, $405 starting 
in July 2014, $457 starting in July 2015, and $527 starting in September 2015. The 
bankruptcy trustee submitted a Direction for Deduction requesting that Applicant’s 
employer deduct the monthly payments from her pay and forward them to him. The 
bankruptcy petition listed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i and 1.o. It also 
apparently contained the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, but that cannot be 
confirmed based on the information presented.8 
 
Applicant submitted reference letters from coworkers and friends that attest to 
her professionalism and trustworthiness. She received a work performance evaluation 
in October 2012 indicated that she met or exceeded expectations.9

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
 
8 
 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts that she was unable or 
unwilling to pay over an extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
9 
 
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.10 
An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he or she has resolved 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the 
financial problems and take sufficient action to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor 
is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first.11 
 
In 2007, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy following a divorce. She was 
making regular payments under that bankruptcy until it was converted in to a Chapter 7 
proceeding. She received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2009. Five of the 
alleged debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o) were most likely discharged in that 
bankruptcy, although they were not listed in a bankruptcy schedule. Credit report entries 
indicated most of those debts were “included in or discharged through bankruptcy.”12 
 
Two of the debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.j) were duplicates of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. AG 
¶ 20(e) applies to those duplicate debts. Excluding the debts discharged in her first 
bankruptcy and the duplicate debts, the remaining eight debts total $15,895. 
 
                                                          
10 See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 
11 See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
12 See GE 2L, 3. Absent fraud in a no-asset bankruptcy, all unsecured, nonpriority debts are 
discharged when the bankruptcy court grants a discharge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, even 
though such debts were not listed on a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3rd 
Cir. 1996); Beezley v. California Land Title Co, 994 F.2d 1433, 1439, n. 4 (9th Cir. 1993); Francis v. Nat’l 
Revenue Service Inc. 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010); and First Circuit Bucks Majority on Discharge 
of Unlisted Debt in No-Asset Case, American Bankruptcy Institute, 28 ABIJ 58 (Nov. 2009). There is no 
requirement to re-open the bankruptcy to discharge the debt. See Collier on Bankruptcy, Matthew Bender 
& Company, Inc. 2010, Chapter 4-523, ¶ 523(a)(3)(A).  
 
10 
 
 
From June 2009 to May 2010, Applicant was laid off from work. This period of 
unemployment had a significant impact on her financial situation. After starting work 
again, she was saddled with legal fees that further set her back. In June 2012, she 
established a debt consolidation program. She made regular payments under that 
program. Through that program, she was able to resolve some of her debts; however, she 
became dissatisfied with the debt consolidation company and cancelled that program 
shortly before the hearing. After the hearing, she received financial counseling and again 
filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The monthly Chapter 13 payments will be deducted from her 
wages and forwarded directly to the trustee.  
 
Particularly troubling is the fact that Applicant continued to open and default on 
debts well after she obtained her current job. Since starting her current job, she has 
defaulted on at least a medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.c), a credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.e), a 
personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.g), and a car loan (SOR ¶ 1.i). Her car was repossessed in March 
2012. Those defaults also occurred well after her security clearance interview in May 
2011 that focused on her financial problems.  
 
Applicant has been encountering financial problems for at least the past six years. 
Her debts are ongoing, significant, and continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. From the evidence presented, I am unable to find 
that her financial problems are unlikely to recur or that they are under control. AG ¶ 20(a) 
does not apply. AG ¶¶ 20(b), AG ¶ 20(c), and 20(d) partially apply, but do not mitigate the 
security concerns arising from the alleged debts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
 
11 
 
 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is highly thought of by her friends and coworkers. She is a valued 
employee. She encountered financial setbacks that were beyond her control. 
Nevertheless, she had failed to show that she is financially responsible. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to 
mitigate the alleged security concerns.
