O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns raised under the guideline for financial 
considerations. His request for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 15, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) citing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).1 In his Answer to the SOR, 
notarized on April 8, 2013, Applicant admitted 6 of the 17 allegations regarding his 
unpaid debts. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On May 17, 2013, DOHA issued a Notice of 
                                                 
1 Adjudication of the case is controlled by Executive Order 10865, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines, which supersede the guidelines listed in 
Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which 
an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  
 
 
 
 
2 
Hearing, and I convened the hearing on June 11, 2013. I admitted four Government 
exhibits (GE 1-4), and eight Applicant exhibits (AE A-H). DOHA received the transcript 
on February 6, 2013.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of 
fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the 
record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 33 years old. He will complete a bachelor’s degree in cyber security 
in about one year. He has worked as an engineer for defense contractors since 2007. 
He worked for employer A from March 2009 to May 2012. It appears from Applicant’s 
testimony that he was unemployed from June to August 2012. From September to 
November 2012, he worked for a county government. He then returned to employer A, 
where he currently works. During his security interview, Applicant listed three other 
periods of unemployment: August 2006 to January 2007, after his military discharge; 
July to September 2007; and January to March 2009. Applicant married his first wife in 
1999. They were separated for several years, and divorced in 2008. He married his 
current wife in 2008. He has four biological children and two step-children,  ranging in 
age from 6 to 15. His two step-children and one biological child reside with him, and he 
also has intermittent custody of one biological child. (GE 1, 2; Tr. 19-21, 24-27) 
 
 Applicant served in the army from 1999 until his discharge in 2006 at pay grade 
E-4. He held a security clearance since about 2000, while serving in the Army. He 
served in Korea from 2003 to 2004. After Applicant deployed to Korea, his wife told him 
she wanted a divorce. Applicant served in Iraq from 2004 to 2005. When he returned to 
the United States, he found his wife was involved with illegal drugs. He was having 
marital and financial problems, and wanted to leave the military.2 During his August 
2011 security interview, he stated that he purposefully missed one week of formations 
to “get back at” the army. In 2005-2006, Applicant received an Article 15. He was 
administratively separated for patterns of misconduct including missed formations and 
lack of timeliness. His discharge was characterized as general, under honorable 
conditions. (GE 1, 2; Tr. 21-24, 27, 69-70, 75-76) 
 
At his security interview, Applicant stated his financial difficulties stemmed from 
his divorce and his deployments. His ex-wife handled his finances while he was 
deployed from 2003 to 2005, but failed to meet their obligations. Applicant testified that 
he has “. . . never been the one in my household that handles . . .” the finances. He also 
testified that when he was discharged, and at the time of his 2011 security interview, he 
was “. . .  somewhat ignorant to my credit standing at that point.” Applicant’s current 
spouse sought assistance to pay past-due debts from a financial counseling firm in early 
2011. She set up a three-year payment plan, which she will complete within a few 
                                                 
2 Applicant received a summary of his security interview, and signed a notarized statement that the 
summary was “true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.” (GE 2) 
 
 
3 
months. Applicant talked once with his wife’s financial counselor, but did not retain the 
company’s services because he decided he could handle his debts on his own. He was 
advised, however, to dispute any debt which he was “. . .not absolutely sure of. . . .“ (GE 
2; Tr. 32, 42, 45, 58-59, 70-72) 
 
 Applicant’s February 2013 personal financial statement (PFS) shows he and his 
wife earn a net monthly income of $5,867, or approximately $70,000 net annually. With 
monthly expenses of $4,076, and debt payments of $1,027, their monthly net remainder 
(MNR) is $764. He testified that he is putting most of the MNR into a savings account to 
put toward a settlement of his largest debt, the auto loan alleged at SOR ¶1.c. His 
savings account balance is approximately $4,200. He said he will also use it to pay for 
unexpected expenses. In his December 2012 interrogatory response, Applicant 
included a prospective plan that he devised for paying seven SOR debts between 
March and August 2013. (GE 2, Tr. 35, 59-66)  
 
 The 17 debts listed in the SOR total more than $55,000. At his August 2011 
security interview, Applicant stated he had not had financial counseling, but he planned 
to repair his finances. In his December 2012 interrogatory response, he stated that 
several debts were paid, but did not attach supporting documentation.3 His April 2013 
credit report shows a credit rating between 513 and 544, which the credit agency 
describes as “poor.” His delinquencies appear in credit reports dated July 2011, 
December 2012, and April and June 2013. (GE 2, 3, 4; AE E, H) The status of the SOR 
debts follows. 
 
• State income tax liens: (allegations 1.a, $4,896; 1.b, $3,036; 1.o, $5,036) 
RELEASED. Applicant owed a total of $12,968 in unpaid state income taxes for 
tax years 2007, 2010, and 2011. He had income from several different states in 
2007, and did not know how to prepare his return. In his security interview, he 
stated he did not file the return for the 2007 tax year. He admits that the 2007 
tax problem “. . . went unhandled for a lot longer than it should have.” Applicant 
testified that he owed the 2010 and 2011 taxes because his ex-wife did not 
honor their agreement about how they would allocate their dependents on their 
separate returns. He made payment arrangements for the liens related to tax 
years 2010 and 2011. However, he testified that when he was unemployed in 
2012, he “defaulted on the payment plan.” He provided documentation showing 
the three liens were paid and released in March and April 2013. He also 
testified that paying the three liens “. . . was a huge hit to my finances and it 
took every bit of any – of any contingency savings we had.” (GE 2; AE A, C; F; 
Tr. 28-31, 66) 
 
• Auto loan (allegation 1.c, $14,128) DISPUTED. Applicant purchased a car in 
2005. He made payments while in the army, but it became delinquent in 2006 
                                                 
3 Applicant was granted an extension of time to gather documentation to attach to his interrogatory 
response, but he noted that, “I have not been able to collect all required documentation for the accounts 
listed in this interrogatory. I will continue my efforts to collect this documentation for my records.” (GE 2) 
 
 
4 
after he was discharged and he was unemployed. When he moved in 2007, he 
left the car with his girlfriend. He sent her money and thought she was making 
the payments. He thought the car was then repossessed, but the company 
does not have the car. In his December 2012 interrogatory response, he stated 
he was not making payments on this debt. He testified he disagrees with the 
balance. However, his June 2013 credit report does not indicate a dispute; it 
lists the account as a profit and loss write off or charged off account. Applicant 
has contacted the lender to negotiate a settlement, but he provided no evidence 
of his contacts or of a settlement offer. When he pays off another car loan in 
September 2013, he hopes to use the resulting $404 per month to start paying 
this debt. (Answer; GE 2; AE H; Tr. 31-38)  
 
• Government agency (allegations 1.d, $2,119; 1.e, $2,297) IN PAYMENT. 
These two debts represent overpayment of government benefits. Applicant's 
college tuition was paid by a government agency. He failed some classes and 
withdrew from others. He was required to refund the tuition. His June 2013 
credit report shows both accounts in collection status. Applicant currently 
receives benefits while he is attending school. The government agency is 
withholding funds from his benefits to pay the delinquencies. As of May 2013, 
one debt had been reduced to $686, and the other had been reduced to $451. 
(AE B, G, H; Tr. 39-41) 
 
• Credit card accounts (allegations 1.f, $2,817; 1.h, $6,022; 1.n, $1,436) The 
credit card account at ¶ 1.f was opened in late 2003 or early 2004, while 
Applicant was in Korea and his wife was handling the finances. In his 2011 
security interview, Applicant stated he had made no payments because he 
believed he did not owe the debt based on the statute of limitations. However, 
at the hearing, he testified his ex-wife paid the debt at ¶ 1.f. He provided no 
documentation to support his claim. The debt appears in his 2011 credit report, 
but not in the 2012 or 2013 reports. (GE 2, 4; AE E, H; Tr. 42-43) 
 
In his December 2012 interrogatory response, Applicant listed the debt at ¶ 1.h 
as “Paid,” but did not provide supporting evidence. However, at the hearing, he 
testified he does not recognize the debt. He disputed it with the credit agencies 
and it does not appear on his June 2013 credit report. (GE 2, 3, 4; AE E, H; Tr. 
41-43, 46-47; 53-55) 
 
The account at ¶ 1.n was opened in 2004, while Applicant was in Korea. In his 
security interview, he stated he would pay the account if it was not resolved 
based on the statute of limitations. He listed the debt as “Paid,” in his 
interrogatory response, but did not provide supporting evidence. However, it 
appears he later disputed it, because his June 2013 credit report shows it is 
disputed. (GE 2, 4; AE H; Tr. 53-55) 
 
 
 
5 
• Auto loan (allegation 1.g, $8,941) DISPUTED. Applicant and his ex-wife 
bought a car in 2002. He believes she made payments when he deployed. 
However, the account became delinquent. In his security interview, Applicant 
stated he might not be responsible for the debt based on the statute of 
limitations. The July 2011 credit report shows that Applicant disputed the 
account. It does not appear on his 2012 or 2013 credit reports. (GE 2, 3, 4; Tr. 
43-45) 
 
• Communications (allegations 1.i, $190; 1.l, $929; 1.m, $282) DISPUTED. 
Applicant testified that the cable debt at allegation 1.i was paid in April 2013, but 
did not provide documentation. In his December 2012 interrogatory response, 
Applicant stated the cell phone debts at allegations 1.l. and 1.m were paid. 
However, he testified at the hearing that he never had an account with the 
creditor at allegation 1.l. He disputed the two cell phone debts with the credit 
agencies. They do not appear in his June 2013 credit report. (GE 2; Tr. 47-48, 
50-53) 
 
• Retail (allegation 1.j, $34) UNRESOLVED. This account was opened in 2010. 
The last activity occurred in May 2011, and it subsequently became a 
collections account. Applicant testified that he paid it by electronic check; 
however, he did not provide documentation. It does not appear in his June 2013 
credit report. (GE 4; Tr. 48; AE H) 
 
• Rent (allegation 1.k, $1,894) UNRESOLVED. Applicant lived in this apartment 
from August 2006 to May 2007, after his discharge from the army. In his 
December 2012 interrogatory response, he listed it as unpaid, with no payment 
arrangements in place. He testified at the hearing that this debt was settled for 
about $950, and it was paid by the telephone via electronic check in April 2013. 
He did not provide documentation to support his claim. (GE 2, 4; Tr. 48-50) 
 
• State collections unit (allegation 1.p, $1,316). UNRESOLVED. Applicant was 
taking classes paid for by the federal government agency listed at ¶¶ 1.d and 
1.e. He was required to repay the cost of classes he either failed or from which 
he withdrew. The debt was forwarded to his state’s collection unit. Applicant has 
spoken with the creditor by telephone. Sometime in fall 2013, he plans to start 
paying this debt with the funds that become available after he pays the two 
debts owed to the same government agency listed in allegations 1.d and 1.e. 
(Tr. 55-57) 
 
• Medical debt (allegation 1.q, $221) PAID. Applicant opened this medical 
account in September 2012. He provided a copy of a cancelled check showing 
that he paid it on March 7, 2013. (AE D; Tr. 57)

Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, commonsense determination 
based on all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the 
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions must also reflect 
consideration of the “whole-person” factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the guidelines. The 
presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not determine a 
conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines are 
followed when a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance 
governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this case, the 
pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration of the 
adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F.  
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial 
burden of producing admissible information on which it based the decision to deny or 
revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must prove 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls 
to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case. Because no 
one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of 
persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the 
Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the national interest as her 
or his own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of 
the Government.7 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
AG ¶18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                 
4 Directive. 6.3. 
5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.

7 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially over-
extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
 The concern under Guideline F is broader than the possibility that an applicant 
might knowingly compromise classified information in order to obtain money. It 
encompasses concerns about an individual’s reliability, judgment, and other qualities 
essential to protecting classified information. One who is financially irresponsible might 
also be irresponsible, negligent, or unconcerned in handling and safeguarding sensitive 
information.8  
 
 Over the past ten years, Applicant had numerous debts that became delinquent 
and were written off or sold to collection agencies. He also failed to timely file his state 
tax return in 2007. Until recently, he owed approximately $13,000 for state income tax 
delinquencies for tax years 2007, 2010, and 2011. The record supports application of 
the following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 The financial considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate 
security concerns. I have considered the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 20, especially 
the following:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
                                                 
8 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 
8 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s delinquencies are numerous. Although they became delinquent up to 
ten years ago, they are recent because many are still unpaid. The debts did not result 
from unusual circumstances that would be unlikely to recur. Applicant's lack of action 
for the past several years casts doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability. AG ¶ 20(a) 
cannot be applied. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) applies where an individual experiences events over which he had 
no control, and which affected his finances. Applicant receives some mitigation 
because several debts became delinquent while he was deployed and his ex-wife was 
handling the finances. However, for full mitigation, an applicant must act responsibly in 
regard to the unforeseen circumstance. Applicant returned to the United States in 
2005, and could have taken steps between 2006 and 2012 to deal with his 
delinquencies. However, he failed to do so until 2013. He did not act responsibly, and 
receives only partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). 
 
 Applicant had one talk with a financial counselor, but did not retain him, 
preferring to handle his debts on his own. Applicant receives some mitigation for 
payment of four debts, totaling almost $13,000. However, he has not brought his 
finances under control. Applicant’s current debt load is approximately $42,000, and he 
has no concrete payment plan in place to resolve it. Of the remaining debts, he testified 
that he paid five; however, without supporting documentation, these debts cannot be 
considered resolved. He has made no payments toward the largest debt, the $14,128 
auto loan. The payments to the government agency for tuition are being withheld by 
the agency, rather than voluntarily paid by Applicant, and are thus “not the same as, or 
similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.”9 The debts that Applicant 
paid were resolved in March and April 2013, about two months before the hearing. 
Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts motivated 
primarily by the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. AG ¶¶ 20(c) does not 
apply, and AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part.  
 
 Applicant disputed numerous debts, although the basis of his disputes is 
unclear. It is clear from the conflicting information he provided during his security 
interview, interrogatory, and his admissions at the hearing, that he was not sufficiently 
familiar with his finances to know the status of his accounts. He may have had 
legitimate grounds for dispute on some debts, because several were deleted from his 
credit report. However, he did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis 
of the dispute.” Applicant receives partial credit under AG ¶ 20(e).

9 
Whole-Person Analysis   
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the 
Applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant’s conduct and 
all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited 
guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of 
all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  
 
 Applicant’s history includes positive factors, such as his service in the army and 
deployments to Korea and Iraq. He also made some recent efforts to resolve his 
financial obligations. He no longer owes back taxes to the state government, and he 
has paid a medical debt. He took steps to remove debts he thought were inaccurate 
from his credit report. However, the negative factors are more substantial. He has a 
long history of financial problems, some of his debts going back almost a decade. His 
debt to a federal government agency for failed or withdrawn classes is being paid by 
withholding part of his benefits. He provided no evidence to support his claim that he 
paid some of the debts, even though he had notice that documentation was required 
since he completed his interrogatory four months before the hearing. Applicant failed to 
file his state tax return in 2007, and owed income taxes for three tax years until three 
months before the hearing. He did not take substantial action to deal with his debts 
until 2013, when he realized they would negatively affect his application for a security 
clearance. Doubts remain about Applicant's reliability and good judgment based on his 
failure for years to meet his financial obligations.  
 
 Overall, the evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant’s 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concerns raised by the financial considerations guideline.
