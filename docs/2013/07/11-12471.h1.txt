GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 27, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On November 28, 2012, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
December 14, 2012.2 On March 28, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining

Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug 
Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on April 5, 2013. In a statement notarized April 25, 
2013,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on May 9, 2013, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on May 14, 2013, but as of July 18, 2013, he had not submitted any 
further documents or other information. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to drug involvement and personal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 2.a., and 
2.b.) in the SOR. Applicant’s admissions and other comments are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as an apprentice laborer with his current employer since May 2011. He was 
previously employed as a radio broadcaster, media relations assistant, media relations 
director, and laborer. He was unemployed from September 2010 until May 2011.4 
Applicant never served in the U.S. military,5 and never held a security clearance.6 
Applicant received a vocational certificate in audio engineering in December 2003, and 
a bachelor’s degree in communications in May 2010.7 He has never been married.8

Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct 
 
Applicant is a substance abuser whose substance of choice is marijuana. 
Because of inconsistencies in his various versions of his substance abuse history, it 
remains unclear as to the accurate length and frequency of such abuse. He 
acknowledged in his SF 86 that he had used marijuana a couple of times per month 
while attending college from April 2007 until May 2009, “as an alternative to using 
alcohol.”9 He certified that his statement was true, complete, and correct to the best of 
his knowledge and belief and was made in good faith.10 In reality, Applicant’s response 
was false. He subsequently admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose that he had 
used marijuana from May 2009 to May 2011.11 
 
During his personal subject interview, conducted by an investigator from the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2011, Applicant modified his earlier 
substance abuse history and admitted that he had continued to use marijuana until April 
2011. He also acknowledged that he was afraid to admit the true history on his SF 86 
because doing so might jeopardize his job.12 He stated that he took three or four puffs of 
marijuana from a pipe with his college roommates, either at his residence or at a friend’s 
residence.13 Marijuana made him sleepy, but never caused him any problems.14 
Applicant contended that he stopped using marijuana because he was aware that 
continuing to do so would jeopardize his employment.15 He also stated that he intended 
to “never use illegal drugs again.”16 
 
On July 18, 2011, Applicant was reinterviewed by the same OPM investigator. 
Applicant again changed the description of his marijuana use, and acknowledged that 
from May 2009 until May 2010, he used illegal drugs approximately two times per week; 
and from May 2010 until April 2011, he diminished his use to once every three months. 
This time he described his use as two to three puffs on a cigarette.17 Applicant also 
indicated that his father became aware of his drug use in April 2004, when Applicant 
mistakenly left a bag of marijuana on a counter at his father’s residence, and his father 
confronted him about it.18

On August 17, 2011, Applicant was reinterviewed, and Applicant again changed 
the description of his marijuana use. This time, Applicant acknowledged that he had 
actually commenced using illegal drugs in approximately August 2003.19  
 
On September 7, 2011, Applicant was reinterviewed, and Applicant again 
changed the description of his marijuana use. He acknowledged smoking one or two 
marijuana cigarettes two times per week. He stated that he continued such use beyond 
April 2007. As a result of his marijuana use, Applicant gained weight and his grades at 
school went down.20 He did not include his marijuana use for the period August 2003 
until April 2007 because such consistent drug use might look bad for his background 
investigation.21 Applicant denied using any drugs since April 2011, because the 
availability of such drugs was very limited in the location in which he resided, and he did 
not have any contacts in the area. Still, he acknowledged he “would continue using 
drugs only for recreation.”22 He added, if he returned to where he went to school, where 
drugs would be available, he “would hopefully not use any drugs.”23 
 
In December 2012, in response to an inquiry from a DOD adjudicator, Applicant 
admitted that he had used marijuana since June 2011. He used marijuana with friends 
during Christmas 2011, and again in 2012. He stated that he smokes marijuana for “its 
anxiety alleviating qualities.”24 
 
Applicant’s SF 86 contained the following question: “In the last 7 years, have you 
been involved in the . . . purchase . . . of any controlled substance [including 
marijuana]?” Applicant answered “no.”25 He certified that his statement was true, 
complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and was made in good 
faith.26 In reality, Applicant’s response was false. He subsequently admitted that he 
deliberately failed to disclose that he had purchased marijuana from April 2007 to May 
2011.27 During his initial OPM interview in June 2011, Applicant admitted that he had 
purchased marijuana.28 During his July 2011 OPM interview, he again admitted having 
purchased marijuana during the period May 2009 until May 2010, insisting that after

May 2010, the marijuana was always furnished by someone else.29 During his 
September 2011 OPM interview, Applicant admitted that during the period from August 
2003 until April 2007, he generally purchased one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana once 
every two weeks, spending approximately $50 per purchase.30 In December 2012, he 
acknowledged purchasing either one-eighth of an ounce or one-quarter of an ounce of 
marijuana for between $70 and $125 on four occasions in 2012.31 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”32 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”33   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”36 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG & 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
35
 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
36
 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
37
 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
7 
                                      
 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 25(a), any drug abuse (see above definition), is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, 
under AG ¶ 25(c), illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, may 
raise security concerns. Also, where there is an expressed intent to continue illegal drug 
use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use, AG ¶ 25(h) 
may apply. During the period 2003 until 2012, Applicant purchased, possessed, and 
used marijuana. Although he stated, at one point, that he intended to “never use illegal 
drugs again,” he subsequently acknowledged he “would continue using drugs only for 
recreation.” Those statements, along with his repeated use of marijuana, reflect a 
probable intent to continue illegal drug use, and a failure to clearly and convincingly 
commit to discontinue drug use. AG ¶¶ 25(a), 25(c), and 25(h) have been established.   
  The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Under AG ¶ 26(b), 
drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is a demonstrated intent 
not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. 
AG ¶¶ 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply. Applicant used marijuana with varying 
frequency from 2003 until 2012. He claims he did so generally in social settings 
because of “its anxiety alleviating qualities,” and “as an alternative to using alcohol.” The 
issue of marijuana’s status as an illegal drug was apparently not a concern for him. His 
 
8 
                                      
 
continuing abuse of marijuana over such a lengthy period, after being interviewed by 
OPM on multiple occasions, despite initially claiming to have no intention of doing so, is 
troublesome. As he stated, he “would continue using drugs only for recreation.” 
Applicant has shown little effort to demonstrate an intention not to abuse any drugs in 
the future. While he has changed the environment where marijuana was used, he 
simply relocated that environment to other locations. Likewise, while some of his drug-
using associates and contacts have relocated, he simply made new drug-using 
associates and contacts. Other than an admission in December 2012 that he has 
continued using marijuana as recently as 2012, there is no evidence of any specific 
period of abstinence since then. 
In light of the foregoing, it appears that a more thorough demonstration of 
sustained abstinence is appropriate to satisfy continuing concerns that his marijuana 
abuse is unlikely to continue or recur or that it does not cast doubt on Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There should be a proven period of 
abstinence, complete and clear disassociation from drug-using associates, and 
avoidance of the environments where the marijuana was used.   
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), security concerns may be raised when there is a: 
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
Under AG ¶ 16(b), security concerns may be raised by: 
deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant 
facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official government representative.  
Applicant’s responses to the SF 86 inquiries and to the questions of the OPM 
investigators (although not alleged in the SOR) were false and concealed the full scope 
 
9 
                                      
 
of Applicant’s substance abuse history. His initial responses were made because he 
was afraid to admit the true history on his SF 86 because doing so might jeopardize his 
job. The subsequent responses regarding his drug use were made because the truth 
“might look bad for his background investigation.” AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) have been 
established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts. If the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, 
or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment, AG ¶ 17(c) may apply. As to Applicant’s responses to the SF 86 
inquiries and to the questions of the OPM investigators, AG ¶¶ 17(a) and 17(c) do not 
apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.38       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has 
been with his current employer since May 2011. He has never been arrested for 
marijuana abuse.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is much more 
substantial. For nearly ten years, from 2003 until 2012, Applicant purchased,

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

possessed, and used marijuana. His responses to the SF 86 inquiries and to the 
questions of the OPM investigators were false and concealed the full scope of 
Applicant’s substance abuse history. He repeatedly furnished false intentions to not use 
marijuana in the future. Applicant’s actions over such a lengthy period, as well as his 
changing stories, indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide 
by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness 
and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b.:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c.:    Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a.:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.b.:    Against Applicant 
       
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
