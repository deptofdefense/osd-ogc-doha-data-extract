GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 9, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on 
December 21, 2012.2 On another unspecified date, the DOD issued her a set of 
interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on December 21, 2012.3 On 
February 1, 2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February

20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 
1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 7, 2013. In a sworn undated statement, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a decision by an 
administrative judge, but failed to indicate whether or not she wanted a hearing. On 
April 7, 2013, she requested a hearing. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on May 6, 2013. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 
2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 7, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on June 24, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2013. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. 
She submitted two voluminous sets of additional documents, which were marked as 
exhibits (AE J and AE K) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record 
closed on July 8, 2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with an explanation, three of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d.). She 
denied the remaining allegation. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since May 
2011, has served as a full-time help desk support service specialist. She was previously 
employed by the local school system as a computer lab technician, as well as part-time 
with an office supply company.4 She has never served with the U.S. military,5 and she 
has never held a security clearance.6 Applicant received a Bachelor of Science degree

in June 1990, and an Associate of Applied Science degree in information technology, 
with highest honors, in June 2011.7 She has never been married.8  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2000.9 
Applicant’s mother had been a teacher who retired with a pension and social security in 
the mid-1990s, and her father had been a minister and bishop who retired with social 
security in about 2000.10 Applicant’s father was physically unable to continue working at 
the time he retired, and he eventually needed convalescent care. Applicant moved in 
with her parents to assist them with their personal and financial needs. She also 
assisted her mother in providing unspecified care for her grandmother. Although 
Applicant’s mother had some money saved at the time, there was no health insurance 
for Applicant’s father, and the shortages as well as some household expenses had to be 
paid by Applicant and her mother.11  
In mid-2005, Applicant’s mother had several mini-strokes followed by a massive 
stroke, and she was moved to a local nursing and rehabilitation center.12 Medicare was 
to cover a substantial portion of the expenses, with Medicaid serving as a “payer (sic) of 
last resort.”13 All of her mother’s savings, life insurance, and health insurance were 
signed over to the nursing facility.14 A representative from an independent utilization 
review committee for the facility was designated as the representative for Applicant’s 
mother.15 Nearly all of the required paperwork, including a durable power of attorney, 
pertaining to the admission and treatment for Applicant’s mother was signed by 
Applicant as her mother’s representative.16 However, on an unspecified date, in order to 
admit her mother into the nursing facility, believing she was using her mother’s power of 
attorney authority and position,17 Applicant signed a form furnished by the nursing

facility, called a Guarantor’s Agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, she 
personally guaranteed the payment of all charges incurred by or on behalf of her mother 
at the nursing facility.18  
As a direct result of Applicant’s parents’ medical conditions, any medical 
expenses for them that were not covered by private health insurance, Medicare, 
Medicaid, or Applicant’s mother’s savings, were paid, to the extent possible, by 
Applicant from her own personal savings. The monthly costs were between $3,000 and 
$5,000.19 As a result of that unanticipated additional financial burden, Applicant was 
unable to keep up with the monthly payments of her own bills. Some bills became 
delinquent and were placed for collection. When Applicant’s mother passed away in 
2006, the only asset she still owned was the family residence in which Applicant was 
residing. Applicant inherited the mortgage-free residence which she estimated was 
worth less than $70,000.20  
Throughout the entire period of her parents’ illnesses, but especially during 2005-
06, Applicant was overwhelmed by the daily circumstances of worrying about her 
mother, trying to work, attending classes, trying to care for her mother, paying bills, and 
going back and forth between the house and the nursing facility.21 She failed to file her 
2005 federal and state income tax returns in April 2006.22 In May 2006, an unspecified 
collection agency generically called “medical payment data”, on behalf of the nursing 
facility, obtained a default judgment against Applicant and her mother in the amount of 
$26,775.58.23  
At some point, believed by Applicant to be in late 2010, she engaged the 
professional services of a financial counseling company to assist her with a debt 
management plan to resolve her credit problems and start repaying her debts through a 
structured repayment plan.24 The company assessed her financial situation and set up a 
debt management plan, listing a number of Applicant’s delinquent accounts. In addition 
to the initial set-up charge and a $32 monthly fee, Applicant’s monthly deposit of $181 
was to be distributed to her creditors.25 By November 2012, $2,254 had been disbursed 
to various creditors,26 and by May 2013, the amount had increased to $3,148.27 As a

result, three of her non-SOR accounts were paid off, and a fourth was in the process of 
being resolved.28 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, in December 2012, Applicant provided a 
personal financial statement reflecting a monthly net salary of $1,716.34; monthly 
household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of $910; and monthly debt 
repayments of $773.08; leaving a monthly remainder of $33.26 available for 
discretionary savings or expenditures.29 During the hearing, Applicant revised that figure 
upward to between $150 and $200.30 
The SOR identified five purportedly continuing delinquencies. There is the 
judgment on behalf of the nursing facility in the amount of $26,775.58 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).31 
Although a special process server certified that he or she had personally delivered a 
copy of the summons and complaint to Applicant’s mother on March 13, 2006, and a 
different special process server certified that he or she had personally delivered a copy 
of the summons and complaint to Applicant on March 20, 2006,32 Applicant denied ever 
being aware of the service or the judgment until several years later when she was being 
interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
regarding her application for a security clearance.33  
On May 3, 2006, the court entered separate default judgments against both 
Applicant and her mother in the amount of $26,775.58, including the principal balance of 
$23,283.12, and $3,492.46 in attorney fees.34 The nursing facility filed a writ of 
garnishment in June 2006, seeking $27,261.58, including the default judgment amount 
and $486 in costs.35 That same month, the garnishee, Applicant’s employer, made 
payment arrangements with the nursing facility, and the garnishment was released.36 
When she was interviewed by OPM in July 2011, Applicant indicated she would contact 
the collection agent to discuss the matter with them,37 but in December 2012, Applicant

indicated she had not yet taken any actions to resolve the debt.38 She added that her 
plan was to pay off all of her credit card debt, and possibly obtain a loan or sell her 
house to address her other debts, including the judgment, because she had insufficient 
funds now to make a lump-sum payment.39 The debt has not yet been resolved. 
There is an account with a past-due balance of $96 that was placed for collection 
(SOR & 1.b.).40 Applicant initially did not recognize the account or the creditor, but 
indicated she would try to contact the collection agent to discuss the matter with them.41 
The account was subsequently included in Applicant’s debt management plan, but her 
initial payment of $10 was rejected by the collection agent.42 When Applicant called the 
collection agent, they indicated they no longer had the account, and when she 
attempted to call the creditor directly, all she got was an unanswered ringing 
telephone.43 The account was subsequently sold to a debt buyer in 2011.44 The account 
was subsequently paid off through Applicant’s structured repayment plan,45 and it is no 
longer listed in her most recent credit report.46 The account has been resolved. 
  
Applicant’s 2011 credit report reflects six student loans in varying amounts with 
the SLM Corporation, commonly referred to as Sallie Mae, all of which were in a 
deferred status. Four of the loans had been transferred to another lender.47 A seventh 
student loan, also in a deferred status, was listed with the U.S. Department of 
Education.48 Her 2012 credit report reflects 11 student loans in varying amounts with the 
Sallie Mae, four of which had been transferred or sold to another lender, and 7 of which 
were current.49 Two other student loans with the U.S. Department of Education were 
also transferred or sold to another lender.50 There is a student loan account with an 
unpaid balance of $17,176 that was placed for collection with the collection subsidiary of

Sallie Mae (SOR & 1.c.).51 In about December 2011 or before, Applicant and the 
collection agent agreed to a repayment plan, and commencing on December 22, 2011, 
over a year before the SOR was issued, Applicant made preauthorized monthly 
payments of $103.97 for at least six months.52 Those payments continued until money 
got tight for her, and the payments were reduced to $50 per month in about July 2012.53 
She managed to make increased monthly payments on occasion (May and June 2013, 
when she made payments of $75 each month), but generally maintained the rate of $50 
per month.54 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
 
As noted above, Applicant failed to file her 2005 federal and state income tax 
returns in April 2006 (SOR & 1.d.). In May 2013, Applicant completed and submitted her 
2005 federal and state income tax returns.55 The federal return reveals an adjusted 
gross income of $20,558, tax withheld totaling $1,325, and an estimated tax still owed, 
without penalties and interest, of $166.56 Her state return reveals an estimated tax still 
owed, without penalties and interest, of $95.57 Applicant made several payments to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2011 and 2012,58 for the tax years 2005 and other 
years,59 and her $1,700 refund for 2011 or 2012 was, in part applied to the 2005 federal 
income tax.60 When she spoke with the IRS agent in December 2012, she was advised 
that the debt had been paid in full.61 Applicant did not submit a payment to the state 
because she did not have sufficient funds to do so.62 As to the 2005 federal income tax, 
the account has been resolved; as to the state income tax, the account is in the process 
of being resolved.

supportive of Applicant’s application for a security clearance. They have characterized 
her in glowing terms, referring to her following qualities: a giving and loving person, 
unselfish, trustworthy, responsible, mature, logical, practical, honest, dependable, 
intelligent, knowledgeable, skilled, and motivated.63 Applicant’s work performance with 
the school system over a period of six years has generally been considered very good 
to superior, although she saw a slight decline in her overall performance while working 
two jobs and attending school.64 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”65 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”66   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”67 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.68  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”69 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”70 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to

overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In addition, under AG ¶ 19(g), failure to file annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same is potentially 
disqualifying. Commencing in 2000, but essentially since 2005, Applicant started 
experiencing some financial difficulties. Over the next few years, those difficulties 
increased to the point where she was unable to make routine monthly payments for a 
number of accounts. Her accounts eventually started becoming delinquent and were 
placed for collection or went to judgment. She failed to file her 2005 federal and state 
income tax returns. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.71  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The nature, 
frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2005 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and she did 
                                                          
71
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

not spend beyond her means. Instead, her financial problems were largely beyond her 
control.  
Applicant acted responsibly by addressing her delinquent accounts.72 She 
engaged the professional services of a financial counseling company to assist her with 
a debt management plan to resolve her credit problems and start repaying her debts 
through a structured repayment plan. By May 2013, $3,148 had been disbursed to 
various creditors, and as a result, three of her non-SOR accounts had been paid off, 
and a fourth was in the process of being resolved. All but one of her SOR and non-SOR 
delinquencies has either been resolved or is in the process of being resolved. She filed 
her federal and state income tax returns and resolved her federal tax liability. She no 
longer has any other delinquent debts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
confronting her do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.73 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.74

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Her handling of 
her finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection or sold, and one account went to judgment. She also 
failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for 2005 when she was required to 
do so. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and she did not spend beyond his means. Rather, Applicant’s problems were largely 
beyond her control because of her parents’ medical conditions and the actions of a 
nursing facility in having Applicant accept personal responsibility for her mother’s 
nursing care instead of permitting Medicaid take responsibility for the expenses. 
Throughout the entire period of her parents’ illnesses, but especially during 2005-06, 
Applicant was overwhelmed by her mother’s medical condition, treatment, and eventual 
death, along with financial issues, working, and attending classes. Applicant hired a 
financial counseling company to assist her with a debt management plan to resolve her 
credit problems and start repaying her debts through a structured repayment plan. The 
result was positive. She resolved a number of accounts, including non-SOR accounts. 
The entire situation occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:75 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve her accounts.

Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
