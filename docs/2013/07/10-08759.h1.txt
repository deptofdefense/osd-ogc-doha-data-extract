GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 5, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) issued him two sets of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
May 24, 2011.2 On another unspecified date, the DOD issued him a set of 
interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on June 18, 2012.3 On January 30, 
2013, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order

10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); 
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on February 8, 2013. In a sworn statement, dated 
February 20, 2013, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on May 6, 2013. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 
2013. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 7, 2013, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on June 24, 2013. 
 
 During the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 6) and five 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE E) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2013. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. 
He submitted six additional documents, which were marked as exhibits (AE F through 
AE K) and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on July 15, 
2013. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with an explanation, all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s 
explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor who, since April 
2010, has served as a software engineer. He was previously employed full-time by 
other employers as a software developer, web applications developer, and research 
and development software developer.4 During periods of economic difficulties, he also 
held several part-time positions.5 Applicant went through several substantial periods of 
unemployment: February through April 2010, November through December 2008, and 
February 2002 through January 2005.6 He never served with the U.S. military.7 He has

held a secret security clearance since 2009.8 Applicant received a Bachelor of Science 
degree in May 1999.9 He was married in August 2003.10 Applicant and his wife have two 
daughters, born in 2004 and 2006.11 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about February 2002, 
when he was laid off by his employer. He was furnished a severance package and 
accumulated stock options.12 One of the conditions placed on his stock options required 
that they be exercised within a certain time period after termination of employment.13 He 
exercised the options in order not to lose the benefits and to provide a funding source 
for living expenses while he was unemployed. Unfortunately for Applicant, under the 
federal tax rules, any stock options exercised or shares sold within a certain time 
window were to be treated as ordinary income. As a result, when Applicant received his 
W-2 from his employer, the income reflected was significantly higher than Applicant had 
expected.14 Compounding Applicant’s problems, as a result of his sale of the shares 
and the exercise of the stock options, Applicant also received a Form 1099 from his 
broker when the funds were transferred to his bank account.15 When his bank was 
purchased by another bank, the surviving bank also reported the transaction to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Consequently, the IRS miscalculated Applicant’s 
earnings by tripling the amount of what he actually received.16  
Applicant’s repeated efforts to resolve the error on his own with his employer and 
the IRS over a multiple-year period were unsuccessful. In 2003, the IRS filed a 
substitute tax return, demanding as a tax an amount that was greater than Applicant’s 
entire savings.17 He reported in his SF 86 that the requested balance was $70,000.18 
Applicant finally filed his federal income tax return in 2010 with what he believed to have

been the proper amount of income tax, but the IRS ignored that filing.19 Applicant’s 
repeated inquiries to the IRS pertaining to the 2002 tax year only generated responses 
of “no documents responsive to this request.”20 When he was confronted with “the 
imminent threat to his livelihood” as a result of the examination into his security 
clearance eligibility,21 Applicant turned to the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), an 
office that operates independently of any other IRS office and reports directly to 
Congress through the National Taxpayer Advocate.22  
 
The TAS was successful in resolving the erroneous tax assessments, and what 
was originally a $70,000 assessment by the IRS (and alleged in the SOR as $81,033), 
was reduced to $12,829.95, including $2,675.67 in tax and penalty, and $7,673.90 in 
interest.23 The TAS apologized for “[Applicant’s] financial difficulties, the delays 
involved, and any inconvenience this has caused [him].”24 Over the ensuing years, there 
have been several income tax refund diversions applied to the balance.25 The unpaid 
balance, as of July 8, 2013, was $13,096.06.26 It has taken Applicant and the TAS 
several years to arrive at a consensus as to an agreed, adjusted tax for the 2002 tax 
year. Considering that period of time, the periodic payments by refund diversions, and 
Applicant’s intention to pay the entire balance as soon as he is able to do so,27 this 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
In 2007-08, Applicant’s employer went through a period of being taken over by 
two other companies. In November 2008, Applicant’s employer laid off all of its software 
employees, including Applicant.28 Unable to find another job in the area, Applicant 
eventually relocated his family halfway across the country when he found another job. 
He put the house on the market, where it remained for approximately two years during 
the height of the economic recession.29 He kept making his monthly mortgage payments 
during the entire time until he was laid off in February 2010.30 He pursued short sales,

and with the residence listed for about $210,000, had at least one offer for about 
$180,000 rejected by the mortgage lender.31 Finally, on December 31, 2010, the 
property was sold for $150,000 and with a $2,000 contribution by Applicant, both the 
first and second mortgages on the property were paid off.32  
While Applicant satisfied his two mortgages, he neglected to adjust his 
withholding information with his employer, and he no longer had the benefit of his 
mortgage deductions for his 2010 federal income tax. He timely filed his federal income 
tax return, but with the loss of the mortgage deductions, Applicant still had an unpaid 
balance of $1,424.63.33 Applicant contends he paid the final payment on April 15, 2013, 
but offered no documentation to support his contention.34 According to the IRS, as of 
July 8, 2013, the unpaid account balance for the tax year 2010 has been reduced to 
$599.39, including penalty and interest.35 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
Applicant and his wife are both afflicted with sleep apnea. While he was working, 
his employer-sponsored health insurance covered the monthly $110 rental costs per 
device for both items of durable medical equipment used by them, and Applicant would 
pay the monthly $10 copay per device to the equipment provider. Under the terms of the 
rental agreement, if his employer no longer had that coverage, the rental would be 
converted to a purchase.36 When his employer was taken over by another company in 
2007, the new employer had a different health plan and Applicant lost the rental 
coverage. He informed the equipment provider and asked that the rental be converted 
to a purchase, but he received no confirmation for several months. At that time, the 
equipment provider also increased the monthly rental cost per device to $130.37 He 
eventually received a bill for continuing rental of the equipment. Applicant immediately 
returned the equipment and again requested that the account be converted to a 
purchase. He never received a response to either the initial request or the subsequent 
request.38 Instead, the equipment provider placed the account for collection, claiming a 
past-due balance of $2,540.39 Applicant disputed the debt, and requested a validation

from the creditor. He received nothing in response.40 While Applicant offered no 
documentation to support his contention that he disputed the debt with the creditor, the 
2010 credit report does confirm his actions.41 The debt is no longer listed in Applicant’s 
2013 credit report.42 The account has been resolved. 
In response to the DOD interrogatories, in June 2012, Applicant provided a 
personal financial statement reflecting a monthly net income of $6,912, including his 
wife’s $750 income; monthly household, utility, transportation, and food expenses of 
$3,900; and monthly debt repayments of $2,500; leaving a monthly remainder of $500 
available for discretionary savings or expenditures.43 There is no evidence that 
Applicant ever received financial counseling. Applicant furnished documentary evidence 
that he has resolved all of his formerly delinquent non-SOR accounts. 
Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s overall work performance during the period April 2011 through March 
2012 was rated 4 out of a possible 5. He was rated particularly high as a recognized 
expert who was routinely called on by management and customers to provide advice 
and direction on difficult technical issues. He also makes timely and effective decisions; 
meets commitments; consistently accepts expanded responsibilities; and is effective at 
planning, organizing, and prioritizing work.44 His initial eight-month appraisal from the 
same rater noted that Applicant was very reliable; exhibits above average judgment, 
with thinking that is very mature and sound; and is a high volume producer who always 
does more than is expected or required.45 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”46 As Commander in Chief,

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”47   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”48 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.49  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”50 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”51 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise 
security concerns. In addition, under AG ¶ 19(g), failure to file annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same is potentially 
disqualifying. Commencing in 2002, when he was initially laid off, and continuing until he 
obtained new employment in 2005, Applicant started experiencing some financial 
difficulties. Over the next few years, those difficulties increased to the point where he 
was unable to make routine monthly payments for a number of accounts. His accounts 
eventually started becoming delinquent and were placed for collection. He failed to file 
his 2002 federal income tax return. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or

occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evidence 
that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.52 In addition, if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence to resolve the issue, AG ¶ 
20(e) may apply. 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. The 
nature, frequency, and relative recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties since 2002 
make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were largely 
beyond Applicant’s control. He was laid off on three occasions, with the initial layoff 
commencing in February 2002 and continuing until January 2005. Based on redundant 
information submitted to the IRS by his former employer, his stock broker, and his bank, 
the IRS concluded that Applicant’s earnings were far larger than they actually were. The 
matter was finally resolved with the intervention of the TAS, and what the SOR initially 
alleged as being a debt of $81,033, was significantly reduced to $12,829.95. Two 
layoffs later, Applicant finally sold his vacant residence and satisfied the mortgage 
balances. In doing so he neglected to alter his withholding information, and when he 
filed his 2010 federal income tax return, the mortgage deductions were no longer 
available to him, and his income tax liability was higher than anticipated. 
Applicant’s dispute with the durable medical equipment provider arose when the 
provider failed to comply with several obligations: it continued to rent the equipment 
despite the terms of the rental agreement; it failed to comply with Applicant’s request 
that the rental be converted to a purchase; it failed to validate the dispute submitted by

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant; and it failed to respond to Applicant’s requests. Instead, it simply sent the 
account to collection. Applicant disputed the negative credit report listing, and the 
account is no longer listed in his latest credit report. 
 
 Applicant acted responsibly by addressing his delinquent accounts.53 He filed his 
2002 federal income tax return and engaged the professional services of the TAS to 
assist him with the 2002 federal income tax issue.  The IRS finally agreed with Applicant 
and substantially reduced the unpaid income tax balance. Over the years, including 
those in which Applicant was laid off, several income tax refunds were diverted to pay 
the outstanding balance. When funds are available, Applicant intends to continue 
reducing his liability. Applicant’s 2010 federal income tax debt has also been 
significantly reduced to $599.39. His non-SOR accounts have been paid off, and he is in 
the process of resolving those two IRS debts. He no longer has any other delinquent 
debts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.54 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.55

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent. As a result, 
accounts were placed for collection. He was inattentive to his federal income tax 
responsibilities regarding the rules for stock options and mortgage deductions, and he 
failed to file his federal income tax return for 2002 when he was required to do so. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were largely beyond 
Applicant’s control because of his repeated and sometimes lengthy layoffs. Unable to 
resolve a tax problem with the IRS, Applicant obtained the assistance of the TAS. It is of 
some significance that the TAS, an office that reports directly to Congress through the 
National Taxpayer Advocate, apologized to Applicant for his financial difficulties, the 
delays involved, and any inconvenience the matter had caused him. The two IRS debts 
are in the process of being resolved. Applicant also resolved a number of non-SOR 
accounts. The entire situation occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:56 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination. Applicant has made some significant timely efforts to resolve his accounts. 
This decision should serve as a warning that his failure to continue his debt resolution 
efforts or the accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for

a security clearance.57 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005);
