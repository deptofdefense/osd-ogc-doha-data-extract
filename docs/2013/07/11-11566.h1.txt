LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. His history of financial problems or
difficulties is largely due to a lack of health insurance and a business failure, a daycare
center that he owned and operated during 2008–2010. With assistance from his
employer, he recently initiated a good-faith effort to repay the vast majority of his
delinquent debts by repaying approximately $22,000. He presented sufficient evidence
to explain, extenuate, and mitigate the financial considerations security concern.
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On December 4, 2012, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the reasons for the1
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was
assigned to me on May 15, 2013. The hearing took place by video teleconference as
scheduled on June 25, 2013. The transcript was received on July 2, 2013. The record
was kept open until July 15, 2013, to allow Applicant to present additional documentary
evidence. Those matters were timely received and they are admitted without objections
as Exhibits F–K.  
Findings of Fact
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the $964 collection account in SOR ¶
1.q. He admitted the remaining allegations under Guideline F, which alleged 18
delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $100 to $12,311 for a total of about
$31,000; 12 accounts are delinquent medical accounts. His admissions are accepted
and adopted and incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of
fact are supported by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
obtain a security clearance for his job working as an information technology (IT)
specialist in systems integration and networks. He began that job in February 2010, and
he completed a security clearance application in May 2011.  2
Applicant’s employment history includes enlisted service in the U.S. Marine
Corps (active reserve) during 1998–2001. He worked as a contract guard for the U.S.
Marshals Service during 1999–2002. He also worked for his family’s business, a
daycare center, on a periodic or part-time basis during 1994–2008. He then opened his
own daycare center, in a different community, in September 2008. The daycare center
was never profitable and it ceased operations in late 2009 or early 2010.
Applicant married in 1997; he divorced in 2004; and he and his ex-wife are now
living together with their six children, ages 15, 14, 12, 10, 9, and 5-months. He is the
main bread winner. His job as an IT specialist requires extensive business travel. He
earned about $15 per hour when he began his job in 2010. His work responsibilities
increased along with his pay, and he is now earning about $24.50 per hour. He earned
about $86,000 in 2012, as he regularly worked more than 40 hours weekly.

There is substantial evidence establishing that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties.  He attributes his adverse history to the 2008–2010 period when3
he owned and operated the daycare center. He believes the business failed due to the
downturn in the economy that began in late 2008. He could not afford heath insurance
during this time, and so he, his ex-wife, and children were uninsured. The 19 delinquent
accounts in the SOR fall into three categories: (1) 12 medical accounts; (2) six
consumer accounts; and (3) a deficiency balance stemming from a repossession of an
auto in 2009. 
In advance of the hearing, Applicant’s employer approached him and offered to
hire an attorney to represent him. Applicant suggested his employer forgo paying
attorney’s fees and instead authorize a payroll advance or loan for him to repay his
delinquent debts. Given that much of the debt is related to uninsured medical care, his
employer agreed and they memorialized their agreement in a letter dated June 24,
2013.  The next day the employer deposited $22,382 into Applicant’s account.  He then4 5
spent $22,445 to resolve ten medical accounts and the repossession. He will repay his
employer via payroll deductions of $500 monthly with no interest due. 
The 12 medical accounts range in amounts from $100 to $5,714 for a total of
about $16,271. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.p) The debts were incurred for
necessary medical care and treatment during office calls or trips to the emergency room
for Applicant or his family. Applicant resolved ten medical accounts owed to two
creditors in the sums of $15,390 and $4,035, respectively, which is more than alleged in
the SOR.  The other two medical accounts for $670 and $408 (SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l)6
were not addressed in his payment documents. 
The deficiency balance of $12,311 stemmed from a repossession in about 2009.
(SOR ¶ 1.m) Applicant resolved it with a lump-sum payment of $3,000 as full and
complete settlement of the account.7
The six consumer debts range in amounts from $282 to $964 for a total of about
$3,419. (SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s) Applicant is disputing the debt in SOR ¶
1.q as well as the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r. He is disputing the latter, a $964 collection
account, because he continues to have an open and current account with the original
creditor. And he provided documentary information to that effect.  He is disputing the8

Concerning the other four consumer accounts, the $549 charge-off account in

2011 credit report, but it does not appear on credit reports from 2012 or 2013.  He paid13
the $282 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.o.  He also believes he paid the $543 collection14
account in SOR ¶ 1.s, but did not have documentary proof of payment. I am unable to
find proof of that debt in the multiple credit reports or interrogatories.  In addition to15
those accounts, he presented proof of payment for five other accounts.  16
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As17
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt18
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An19

unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting21
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An22
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate23
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme24
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it27
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant28
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 29
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  30
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
Applicant’s unfavorable financial history indicates inability or unwillingness to
satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations.  The facts are more31 32
than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. In reaching this
conclusion, I considered that 12 debts in the SOR are medical collection accounts. As
such, I gave those debts less weight because they were incurred for necessary medical
care and treatment, not consumer goods, luxuries, or frivolous items, and they are not
the type of debt that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, unwillingness to abide
by rules and regulations, misconduct, or irresponsible behavior.
There are six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and I have especially33
considered the following:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
 ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 34

separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debt.
  Applicant is a 34-year-old IT specialist who is enjoying success working for a
federal contractor as shown by his increasing responsibilities and pay. He does not
dispute his adverse financial history, which is largely due to a lack of health insurance
and a business failure. His current employer has high regard for him as shown by the
payroll advance or loan of about $22,000. He used that money to retire ten delinquent
medical accounts and a deficiency balance owed from a repossessed vehicle. Although
his payments are quite recent, it is understandable given that he began his current job
coming out of a business failure. Under that circumstance, it is not surprising that he
lacked extra money to repay his delinquent debts while at the same time providing for
his large family. Moreover, his recent payment of more than $22,000 to resolve
delinquent debts is indicative of both good faith and responsible behavior. In doing so
he resolved the vast majority of his delinquent debts. In addition, concerning the six
consumer accounts, he is disputing two, he paid one of the accounts and believes he
paid another, another is unresolved, and one consumer account is lacking proof of its
existence. The remaining unresolved debts can be addressed in due course.  
Of course, a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and34
trustworthiness consistent with the security guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating
Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.35
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).36
8
Based on the available evidence, I am persuaded that Applicant has taken enough
significant actions to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F. 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and
evaluating the evidence in light of the whole-person concept,  I conclude Applicant36
presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and mitigated the security concern.
Accordingly, I conclude he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.s: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
