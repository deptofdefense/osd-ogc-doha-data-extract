Applicant incurred significant, unpaid debts, following the loss of his job in 2001 and
attendant medical insurance. At the same time, his wife and daughter required significant medical
care. After eight months of unemployment or part-time employment, he returned to work full-time.
He is the sole provider for his family. He has paid many of his smaller debts and has established
payment plans on other debts, which he regularly pays. He has mitigated the government’s security
concerns regarding his personal finances under Guideline F. Clearance is granted.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On October 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the
SOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department
of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or
revoked. On November 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He
requested a hearing. He submitted a supplemental notarized response on December 13, 2006.
DOHA assigned this case to another administrative judge on January 16, 2007, and
transferred this case to me on April 25, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 17, 2007,
which he timely received. I held a hearing on June 5, 2007, immediately following Applicant’s return
from an overseas work assignment. The government submitted 5 exhibits (GE), which were marked
and admitted into evidence as GE 1-5, without objection. Applicant submitted 14 exhibits (App Ex),
which were marked and admitted into evidence as App Ex A-N, without objection. Applicant
testified. I held the record open for Applicant to submit additional documentation, which he timely
did. He submitted 4 additional documents, which were marked and admitted as App Ex O-R, without
objection. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 21, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a. 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, 1.p, and 1.q under Guideline F of the
SOR. He neither admitted nor denied subparagraphs 1.c, 1.h., 1.s, 1.t, and 1.w, and asserted that
subparagraph 1.i. was the same as subparagraph 1.g. under Guideline F of the SOR.  His admissions1

are incorporated as findings of fact. The remaining allegations are deemed denied.  After a complete2
review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant, a 37-year-old man, works as a technician and crew chief for a Department of
Defense contractor. He has been employed with his company for almost five years. He filed an
application for a security clearance (SF-86) in May 2005.3
Applicant married in 1996. He has an 11-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter. He
graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1997 and anticipates receiving a
masters degree shortly. After college graduation, he worked steadily until April 2001, when his
employer laid him off due to a reduction in force. During the next eight months, he worked part-time.
He also received unemployment benefits. He obtained employment in December 2001 and has
worked regularly since then.4
In 2001, his daughter required kidney surgery. His wife suffers from multiple medical
problems, including back problems and gall bladder problems, which prevent her from working. One
year ago, her back problems deteriorated significantly, requiring her to undergo surgery as did her
gall bladder. After her surgery, she remained bedridden for sometime. His daughter required
expensive dental work last summer. In January 2006, his father-in-law died unexpectedly. In March
2006, he purchased a larger home so that his mother-in-law could live with his family.5
Applicant currently earns $44,000 a year, but anticipates that his salary will increase $15,000
to $20,000 a year after he receives his masters degree. His monthly net pay is approximately $2,400.
In March 2007, he received approximately $485 in additional net pay and in May 2007, an additional
$642 in net pay for overtime. His mother-in-law contributes $600 a month towards the family
housing costs. His job requires him to travel for significant periods of time, for which he receives
per diem income to cover his out-of-town living expenses. Any excess per diem is used for
household expenses. His monthly expenses total approximately $3,500. He used this year’s tax return
to pay bills.6
A review of Appellant’s credit reports dated September 21, 2006, January 9, 2007, and the
SOR shows 23 unpaid debts totaling $19,824.  The current status of these debts is as follows:7

Applicant began contacting his creditor’s last fall. He has negotiated settlements on some of
his outstanding debts and established payment plans for other debts. He challenged several debts,
which he does not recognize. He paid other debts in full. Since he is the sole provider in his
household, he pays each debt as he can. He paid several debts with his bank debit card. Two medical
debts listed in the SOR are unknown to him. The credit reports do not identify the name of the
creditor. Rather, the credit reports simply show a medical bill as unpaid.8

Applicant’s supervisor describes him as trustworthy and reliable. He started his current
employment as a Technician I. He has been regularly promoted and is now a crew chief. His
supervisor would trust him with any available company project.9
POLICIES
The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating
conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the
revised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in
reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular
condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security
clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-
person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,
and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and
recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.10
The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government11
has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a12
preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the13
applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable14
clearance decision.15

Id.; Directive, revised AG ¶ 2(b).18
Executive Order No. 10865 § 7.19

No one has a right to a security clearance,  and “the clearly consistent standard indicates that16
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Any reasonable17
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved
in favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically18
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” The decision to deny an
individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and
patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict19
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate
adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,
all of which can raise questions about an individuals’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG ¶ 18.) Applicant has significant unpaid debt, some of
which has remain unpaid for a number of years. Based on the evidence of record, DC ¶ 19 (a)
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC ¶ 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial
obligations apply to all allegations in the SOR, except 1.u and 1.v. In light of Applicant’s denial of
these allegations, the government has not established its case because the identify of the creditor is
not shown in the credit reports. Thus, the Applicant has not way of knowing if he owes these debts.
Applicant’s employer laid him off from his job in April 2001. He did not obtain full-time
employment until 8 months later. In the same year, his young daughter required kidney surgery. In
addition, his wife experienced continuing and ongoing medical problems, which prevented her from
working. Many of his unpaid bills are medical, and are the result of his wife’s multiple medical
problems. His unemployment caused him to get behind in his bills some time ago. His wife’s health
and inability to work have contributed to his financial problems. MC ¶ 26 (b) the conditions that
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies. 
Although Applicant has never met with a financial counselor, he has contacted many of his
creditors. He negotiated settlement payments for some debts, paid other debts, and made
7
arrangements to make monthly payments on several other debts. He started making the monthly
payments he arranged in November 2006. As a result, some debts have been paid. He continues to
pay on others each month. He used his income tax return to pay some of his debts. Thus, MC ¶ 20
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and MC ¶ 20 (d) the individual
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. 
Applicant challenged the legitimacy of three debts in his response to the SOR. He
acknowledged owing one debt, but did not recognized the other two debts. His challenge to these
debts in his response to the SOR is insufficient to trigger the application of MC ¶ 20 (e) the
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause
of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
Whole Person Analysis
Protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are
not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the
objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person’s
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I
have considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant’s risk and vulnerability in
protecting our national interests. 
Applicant is the sole financial provider for his family. Since his college graduation, he has
worked steadily and regularly, with the exception of eight months in 2001. He lost his job in 2001
as a result of a reduction in force. His job loss impacted his ability to meet his monthly financial
obligations and to provide appropriate medical insurance for his family. Since returning to work full-
time, he has slowly improved his finances. His monthly bills are current. When his widowed mother-
in-law came to live with his family, he needed to purchase a larger home as his home was too small.
His house payments increased. Even with the increased house payment, he has been able to slowly
repay some of his outstanding debts and make small monthly payments on other debts.
Applicant anticipates that his income will increase after he receives his masters degree. His
employer respects his work abilities and has shown appreciation through regularly promotion over
a short period of time. He is a responsible individual. I have weighed the mitigating factors, the
reasons for his debts, his current family situation, his efforts to repay his old debts on a tight budget,
and his employer’s confidence in him. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates
that he is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy. He would not act in a manner which would harm
his employer or the government. I conclude that he has mitigated the government’s concerns about
his finance. Accordingly, Guideline F is found in favor of Applicant.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
