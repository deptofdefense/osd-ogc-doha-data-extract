SYNOPSIS
Applicant is vice president of contracts for a federal contractor.  He abused illegal drugs over
a ten-year period, mostly in high school and college.  He stopped using illegal substances in August
2004, contemporaneous with receiving a substantial promotion from his employer with added
responsibilities.  He stated an intention not to use drugs in the future.  He demonstrated more mature
judgments as his responsibilities increased.  Drug usage was not recent and he successfully mitigated
the drug involvement security concerns.  Clearance was granted.  The government appealed.  The
Appeal Board remanded the decision.  I again conclude that Applicant successfully mitigated the
security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement).  Clearance is granted.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 ¶ E3.1.2
(Jan. 2, 1960), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 24, 2006
detailing the basis for its decision – security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement)
of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 14, 2006, and elected to have
a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on July 11, 2006.  Notice of
Hearing was dated August 25, 2006.  I convened a hearing on September 19, 2006, to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The government offered one exhibit, Applicant offered six exhibits, and all exhibits were
admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 29, 2006.
A decision was entered on October 31, 2006.  The government appealed.  The Appeal Board
remanded the case to me for a new decision on June 21, 2007.
APPELLATE ISSUES
The Appeal Board directed me to reexamine my conclusions, without reference to the
outdated Adjudicative Desk Reference that appears on the DOHA website, found at page 5 and
footnote 32 of the decision.  The original findings of fact were not challenged.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR.  He listed the incidents set forth in the SOR1
in his security clearance application.   He admitted this conduct during his testimony.   These2 3
admissions are incorporated herein.  In addition, after thorough and careful review of the evidence,
I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a married, 27-year-old vice president of contracts for a federal contractor.  He
has a double major in business, and finance and international business.  4

Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 1994 and August 2004.   He5
purchased marijuana.   He abused the prescription drug Ritalin  that had not been prescribed for him6 7
from October 1995 to December 2001, and the prescription drug Percocet  until 2000.  He twice tried8
cocaine between 1999 and December 2001, and used hashish in 2000.   Between March and May9
1999, he twice used MDMA (Ecstasy).   Between 1995 and 2000, he used psilocybin (mushrooms)10
and/or LSD at least five times.  11
The majority of Applicant’s drug use occurred between 1994 and December 2001, when he
was in high school and college.  He used drugs in social settings, with friends at parties, just
“hanging out.”   After graduation, he only used marijuana.  He has taken no drug education classes12
or treatment programs.   He never went to school or work while under the influence of drugs.13 14
Applicant used drugs because of “youth, curiosity, being social,” and for experimental purposes.15
He has not used any illegal substances since August 2004.   His promotion to his current position16
was the “driving force” behind his decision to quit abusing drugs.   “I was promoted.  I now have17
people that report directly to me in my job.  I’ve gotten a substantial salary increase.  I bought a car.
I bought a house.  My wife is pregnant.  These are the big changes in my life.”   He stated his intent18
not to use illegal drugs in the future.  19

Directive ¶ 6.3.27

See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 29

Two of Applicant’s co-workers (one was his supervisor)  testified that Applicant was “mature
for his age and experience,”  had “impressive knowledge level for his job,”  had “tremendous work20 21
ethic,”  and “is reliable, trustworthy, and will maintain classified information.”22 23
POLICIES
“No one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”   As Commander in Chief, the President has24
“the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such
information.”   The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants25
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to do so.”   Each security clearance decision “must be a fair and impartial26
common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information
and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy.”   An applicant “has the ultimate burden of27
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.”28
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
process factors listed in ¶ 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that
the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  The decision to deny an individual
a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely29
an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of
Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
E2.A8.1.1.3. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from30
approved medical direction.
ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 11 2006) (Judge did not err by concluding drug use not31
recent with passage of slightly less than two and a half years between last use and hearing) (citing ISCR Case No.
02-10454 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004)).  See ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999) (not error for
Judge to find that last marijuana use nine months before close of record was not recent).
Directive ¶ E2.2.1.32

CONCLUSIONS
The government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying
Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (Any drug abuse)  and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (Illegal drug30
possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution) are
applicable, because Applicant admitted drug use, possession, and purchase. 
Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1. (The drug involvement was
not recent) applies.  Applicant has been drug free for over two years.  The Directive does not define
“recent.”  In ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 9 (App. Bd.  Oct. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board:
declined to set any "bright-line" rule as to what constitutes "recent" under the
Directive regarding illegal drug use.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (November
23, 2004) at p. 4.  The Board has indicated the matter requires an Administrative
Judge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion
as to the recency of an applicant's conduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22173 (May
26, 2004) at p. 4.  The application of a mitigating condition like Guideline H
Mitigating Condition 1 can depend upon a number of factors in addition to the simple
passage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0611 (November 1, 1999) at p. 2.  The
interval of time presented in this case, slightly less than two and a half years, must
be evaluated in light of other factors in the case.31
Most of Applicant’s 10-year drug usage occurred while he was in school.  He has been drug-free for
nearly two and one-half years.  His lifestyle has changed.  He is now a family man.  And he has been
given significant responsibilities by his employer.  All of these factors work together to convince me
to conclude that his drug use is not recent.
Also relevant is DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3. (A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the
future).  Applicant stated his intent not to use drugs in the future, and has demonstrated it for over
two years.  He has made the changes necessary in his life to mitigate his prior drug involvement.  I
conclude guideline H for Applicant.
Whole Person Analysis
The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.”   “Available,32
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be
Id.33

considered in reaching a determination.”   In evaluating Applicant’s case, I have considered the33
adjudicative process factors listed in the directive.34
  In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I  considered the “whole person”
concept in evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I35
considered his age (26), his education which includes two majors, his employment, and what might
motivate him to stop his drug abuse.  Candor with the government about a person’s negatives is the
crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself,
he may be trusted with confidential or classified information.  This case speaks volumes about the
honesty and integrity of the Applicant, which seems to be a non sequitur.  The government is
suggesting that Applicant is a druggie, that he is irresponsible, reckless, and untrustworthy.  Yet, the
reason for the hearing was because he was honest and demonstrated integrity.  Applicant was
completely truthful about his drug use, disclosing it on his security clearance application, admitting
his usage in his answer to the SOR, and in his testimony. 
The illegal use of drugs raises questions regarding an individual’s willingness or ability to
protect classified information.  Moreover, impaired ability while under the influence of illegal drugs
increases the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified material.  His drug use extended over
a ten-year period, most of this time he was in high school or college.  Applicant’s motivation to use
drugs was peer pressure and a desire to be sociable.  In the last three years, Applicant has made
significant changes in his life.  He married in 2003.  He discontinued use of marijuana in 2004.  He
bought a car and a home.  He received a major promotion from his employer, one that carries with
it increased responsibility for himself and other employees, and compensation.  Applicant is now 26
and is a more mature decision-maker.  He stated an intent not to use drugs in the future. 
I have carefully weighed the mitigating factors, the totality of the circumstances surrounding
his decision to smoke marijuana until 2004, his honesty in revealing this information, his work ethic,
his recent conduct, and his change in attitude against the seriousness of his misconduct.  I have
concluded that he would not act in a manner which would harm the government.  There is little
likelihood he could be pressured, coerced, exploited, or subjected to duress for his past conduct.  I
observed Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his testimony to
be believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered questions
directly, completely, and honestly.  I believe Applicant will remain drug free in the future.  I,
therefore, have no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's willingness and ability to
protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected
of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance.
