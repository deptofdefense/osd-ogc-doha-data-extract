STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On February 29, 2004, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
February 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security
clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its2
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative
Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for
SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  was provided to Applicant when the SOR
was issued. 
In a sworn, written statement, dated March 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2007. A Notice of
Hearing was issued on April 11, 2007, scheduling the hearing for April 25, 2007. The hearing was
conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered one exhibit, Ex. 1. Applicant
offered four exhibits, Exs. A-D. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objections. Prior
to the hearing, the Government submitted seven documents about PRC for administrative notice. At
the hearing, these documents were not objected to and they were admitted into the record and marked
as Exs. I-VII. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a and 1.d. Those admissions
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b
and 1.c. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 45 years old and has worked as a software engineer for a defense contractor
since 2001. He was born in PRC and graduated from a PRC university with a bachelor’s and a
master’s degree in science. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1986 on a teaching certificate offered by
a well-known university. He graduated with a second master’s degree in science in 1988. He became
a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2002. He is single and has never married.
Applicant’s mother and father are citizens and residents of PRC, living in the countryside.3
His parents are in their 70s and are retired textile engineers.  He sends his “parents money to help4

make their lives easier, since their combined retirement pay is only $200.00 a month.”  Between5
2002 and 2005, Applicant sent his parents $17,500, which breaks down as follows: 2002/$2,000;
2003/$6,000; 2004/$1,500; 2005/$8,000. He did not send them money in 2006. He does not
anticipate sending them money in 2007.  He stated that: “[t]hey use most of the money I send them6
to improve or fix the old house they bought when they moved there. And I don’t have any plan to
have any financial investments in China.”  He talks to his mother by telephone about five to six7
times a year.  He rarely talks to his father.8 9
Applicant stated that his relationship with his parents is not close.  His grandparents raised10
him until he was eight and recounted:
. . . when I joined my parents and the brothers, almost 1,000 miles away. Both of my
parents were abusive. Beating and scolding their children were commonplace, and
often for no reason. I dreaded weekends, since they would be home all day. It felt like
walking on eggshells every day. The sad thing about this is they didn’t even realize
they were abusing their children.11
Upon graduating from high school at age 14, he left his family and never lived with them
again except for visits during school breaks from college and some holidays.  The PRC policy at12
the time was “any high school graduate must go to countryside to live and work as a farmer if he or
she is not the only child in the family.”  He lived in the countryside for a year and nine months.13 14
He was then accepted at a PRC university at the age of 16, and received two degrees from that
school.15
Applicant’s two brothers are citizens and residents of PRC. His oldest brother is a principal
and teacher at a small private high school, in one of the poorest areas of China. This brother is

divorced and has a son.  His younger brother is an electrical engineer at a broadcasting company.16
He is also married and has a son.  He talks to his older brother about four or five times a year. He17
talks to his younger brother about twice a year.  He stated:18
My relationship with my two brothers is also more biological then [sic] by affection
or bond. Since I came to the States, I had virtually no contact with both of my
brothers prior to 2003, except during my visit to China in 1995.19
Since Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1986, he has visited China only three times in
more than 20 years. He has not had any contact with the Chinese government officials during any
of his visits.  He first visited PRC in April 1995. His second visit was in September 2003. His last20
visit to PRC was in April 2006. Applicant traveled to China in April 2006 for his mother’s 70th
birthday celebration. He has no plans to visit China in 2007. According to local custom, he stated
that his mother’s 70th birthday was celebrated in 2006, one year prior to her actual 70th birthday.
His father’s 70th birthday was celebrated in 2004, two years prior to his actual 70th birthday. He
stated:
My activities during my visits to China were mostly just visiting family and old
friends and eating good food with them. I never discussed the specifics of my job
with anyone during my trips to China. And I never took any work related materials
when I visited China.  21
Applicant had casual contact with Chinese Embassy representatives in about April 2000
while attending a luncheon. He also went to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., in about
October 1999 with the president of a PRC university, his former professor, and with three other
Chinese professors.
Applicant submitted four character witnesses at the hearing. The first witness is a retired
Army Lieutenant Colonel. As a civilian, he has worked with Applicant for the past two years.  He22
believes Applicant is honest and a valuable asset to the projects they work on at work.  The second23

witness is a project manager and she hired Applicant in 2001.  She testified that Applicant does an24
outstanding job as a team leader at work.  She sees him every day and at times, several times a day.25
She believes he is honest and trustworthy.  The third witness is a dance instructor at a well-known26
university as well as at a privately owned studio.  He has known Applicant for 12 years and they are27
roommates.  He believes Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and dependable.  The fourth witness is28 29
a software programmer and he met Applicant at work in 2001. They socialize at work at lunchtime
and have gone to games and other social events with other coworkers outside of work.  This witness30
too believes that Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and dependable.31
Two colleagues provided affidavits attesting to Applicant’s integrity, loyalty, and
professionalism. They both recommend him for a security clearance.  Another colleague, the first32
witness to testify, also provided a written endorsement for Applicant being granted a security
clearance.33
Applicant has strong ties to the U.S. He owns a house with his best friend.  He has a34
retirement plan, and other bank accounts. He has developed close relationships through the years
with friends at work. He has a career that he excels in and really enjoys.35
The PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the
U.S. It has cooperated with the U.S. in the global war on terrorism in recent years. It has an active,
effective intelligence service that targets U.S. intelligence and economic information, and operates
against its citizens in the U.S. However, under PRC law, citizens who become naturalized citizens
of other countries lose their PRC citizenship.

Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating
a person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying
conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,
each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed
in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the
motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,
or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and
(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome
determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured
against this policy guidance.
The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government36
has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a37
preponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant38
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.39
Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance
decision.40
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard indicates that41
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Any reasonable42
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved
in favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security43
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication44
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have
established for issuing a clearance.

CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the
following conclusions.
Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist for an individual with divided loyalties or foreign
financial interests. The person may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,
organization, or a government in a way that is not in the interests of the U.S., or is vulnerable to
pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. 
Applicant’s parents and his two brothers are citizens and residents in PRC. PRC is a country
that exploits its citizens and engages in espionage. Therefore, Applicant’s relatives living in PRC pose
a potential security threat and are in a position likely to create a heightened risk of exploitation by the
PRC government. Consequently, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition ¶ 7(a) (contact with a
foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of
or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,
inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies.
Various factors can mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The fact that his parents
are citizens and residents of PRC does not constitute an unacceptable security risk. Applicant visits
his parents to support them with his love and respect during their advancement as senior citizens.
Although they are his biological parents, he was raised by his grandmother, who is now deceased. He
does not have a lot of love and affection for his parents. For the past 20 years, Applicant has developed
strong ties to the U.S., which include real estate ownership, bank and retirement accounts. Applicant
has a profession here that he is extremely proud of and that he excels in. Once Applicant became a
naturalized U.S. citizen, he lost his PRC citizenship. Thus, it is unlikely that Applicant would be
sought out as a spy for PRC while he resides in the U.S. or visits PRC. Moreover, in the unlikely event
that Applicant is approached by PRC while he is in the U.S., he is aware of the protocol in place to
report such a transgression. It is highly unlikely that Applicant would jeopardize his relationships and
loyalties in the U.S. in any way. Applicant can be trusted to resolve any conflict of interest with
relatives in PRC in favor of the U.S. Thus, Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) ¶ 8(a)
(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located,
or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual
will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,
organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) and FI MC ¶ 8(b) (there is no conflict of
interest, either because the individual’s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,
government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships
and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor
of the U.S. interest) apply. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are concluded in favor
of Applicant.
I considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in
light of the “whole person” concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified
information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national
security. Applicant presents a highly credible case that he would not be influenced by anything
8
contrary to the best interests of the U.S. He is biologically related to his parents, but he does not have
a lot of love and affection for them and theirs is not a close familial relationship. He was raised by his
grandparents. He has infrequent contact with his sibling. His residence in the U.S. for more than 20
years and his career record as a trusted employee, refute the risk that he would take any action that
would jeopardize U.S. security interests. He has assimilated into U.S. customs and culture, and has
become a model employee of a major defense contractor. Applicant can be trusted to resolve any
conflict of interest with relatives in PRC in favor of the U.S. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the
potential security concerns arising from his personal ties to PRC. I find that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 2. Guideline B (Foreign Influence): FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: For Applicant
DECISION
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.
