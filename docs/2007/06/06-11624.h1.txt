Applicant incurred significant, unpaid debt as a teenager and young man. The creditors to
whom he owes most of his unpaid debts are barred from collecting their money under the state
statute of limitations. He has matured and learned to better manage his finances. He lives within his
financial means and has not incurred additional new, unpaid debts. He did not intentionally falsify
his answers on his questionnaire for a position of public trust. He has mitigated the government’s
concerns under Guidelines E and F. Eligibility is granted.
STATEMENT OF CASE
On August 25, 2004, Applicant signed and completed an application for a position of public
trust, an ADP I/II/III position, which he resigned on October 4, 2004 and submitted. The Defense
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.
2, 1992), as amended (the “Directive”).  On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement1
of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the
administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). DOHA recommended the case be referred to
an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust should be granted,
continued, denied, or revoked. On October 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to
the allegations. He requested a hearing.
DOHA assigned this case to me on April 18, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on May 17,
2007. Since Applicant received the hearing notice on May 23, 2007, which was less than 15 days
before the hearing scheduled for June 5, 2007, Applicant waived his right to receive the notice of the
hearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The government2
submitted six exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6, without
objection. Applicant submitted seven exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App
Ex A-G, without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I held the record open for Applicant
to submit additional evidence, which he did not do. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on
June 21, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
In his SOR response, Applicant admits to the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e,
and 1.g-1.j under Guideline F. He admits to Guideline E allegation 2.a with an explanation, which
is deemed a denial of intentional falsification. He denies all of the remaining allegations under

Guideline F.  Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful3
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant, a 28-year-old accounting technician working for a Department of Defense
contractor, seeks a position of public trust. He started his employment with the contractor in January
2002.4
Applicant graduated high school and attended the state university for one year. In February
1999, he enlisted in the United States Army. During the two and one-half years he served in the
Army, he received counterintelligence training and obtained other college credits. He held a top secret
clearance. The Army awarded him two Army Achievement Medals, two NATO Medals for Service,
an Army Commendation Medal, and several certificates of appreciation or achievements. The Army
honorably discharged him because of a disability in October 2001. The Veterans Administration (VA)
determined that he has a 30% service connected disability due to migraine headaches. Upon his
discharge from the military, Applicant worked temporary jobs until he obtained his current job.
Applicant is married and has a 4-year-old daughter.5
A review of Appellant’s credit reports dated October 13, 2004, May 9, 2006, March 28, 2007,
and the SOR shows 10 unpaid debts totaling $15,816.  The current status of these debts is as follows:6

In March 2001, Applicant and his girlfriend, who is now his wife, signed an apartment lease
for 6 months. They renewed the lease on October 1, 2001 for another 6 months at a rent of $544 a
month. On April 1, 2002, they became month-to-month tenants. Because of vandalism problems in
the apartment complex, they gave their notice to vacate around April 5, 2002. They directed their
deposit of approximately $400 be used to pay any remaining rent. The apartment complex then sent
them an eviction notice. They moved on April 15, 2002. On April 18, 2002, the apartment complex
sent him a bill for $1,035.92. The bill reflected a monthly rent of $619 and a month to month fee of
$75, amounts not shown on the renewal lease. The apartment complex determined Applicant owed
$330 for rent from April 5, 2002 through May 5, 2002 and a $40 month-to-month fee, plus $75 for
miscellaneous, unspecified damages, $105 for a late fee, and $486 for a reletting fee. The bill did not
reflect how the security deposit was applied. The apartment complex noted that no rent had been paid
for April 2002, which conflicts with their rent payment request for the month of April 5, 2002 through
May 5, 2002; that the unit was dirty; and that if the bill was not paid in 10 days, a file would be sent
to collections. The apartment complex never filed a law suit; however, upon receipt of the eviction
notice, Applicant wrote to a local judge about his problems with the apartment complex and sent a
copy to the apartment complex. No court action took place nor is the eviction notice part of the
record.7
As young adults, Applicant and his wife purchased furniture with a credit card. The largest
unpaid debt in the SOR is for this furniture. He estimated the total debt at $6006, not $11,603 balance
reflect in the credit reports. The additional charges may represent fees and interests accrued over time
on this cancelled credit card. He acknowledged the unpaid bill in allegation 1.b. He paid much of the
indebtedness he incurred with this creditor, but didn’t fully pay the bill because he needed the money
to pay other expenses. His credit reports reflect that he disputed the debts in allegations 1.e, 1.g. and
1.i, although he admitted owing the unpaid debt at the hearing.  8
He denies the debt in allegation 1.c., which is a military credit card. None of the credit reports
of record show a debt in this amount; rather the reports reflect a zero balance in his military credit

card account. The government appropriated his 2006 tax refund as payment towards this debt. He also
denies the allegation in 1.f, stating that he paid this account through a collection agency, he had hired
to help resolve his debt issues. For 8 months, he made monthly payments to the agency for the
purpose of resolving the debts in allegations 1.e and 1.f. He has not provided any evidence to show
payment or an agreement with a collection agency.9
Applicant’s gross monthly salary in 2005 totaled $1,908 and his net monthly income totaled
$1,622. His monthly expenses in 2005 totaled $1,421, leaving $201 for repayment of debt. At the
hearing, he advised that he now receives $420 a month in disability benefits from the VA. He timely
pays his current bills and has not incurred additional new, unpaid debts. He and his wife recently
purchased a house.10
When Applicant completed his SF-85P on the afternoon of August 25, 2004 at work, he
answered “no” to question 22b, which asked if he “was now over 180 days delinquent on any loan
or financial obligation?” In his response to the SOR, he stated he thought the question asked for debts
not listed on form (this form is unidentified). At the hearing, he acknowledged that he knew he had
debts when he completed the form. He may have been careless and he did not think his debts were
serious.11
At the hearing and in his 2005 written statement, Applicant asserted that he concentrated on
paying his wife’s debts first. He further stated that when her debts were paid, he would start paying
his debts. He has provided no documentary evidence which shows that he paid her debts. Likewise,
the record contains no evidence of his current work performance.12
POLICIES
The President has “the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position … that
will give that person access to such information.”  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding13
Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and
procedures for determining trustworthiness within the executive branch. 
To be eligible for a trustworthiness determination, an applicant must meet the security
guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security
guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.
Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those

which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and
discussed in the conclusions below.
The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a trustworthiness determination.  An14
administrative judge must apply the “whole person concept,” and consider and carefully weigh the
available, reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the15
following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of
the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7)
the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and
(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.16
Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that
disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.17
Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate the facts.  An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent18
with the national interest to grant eligibility for a position of public trust.”  Any doubt as to whether19
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor
of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to20
sensitive positions.
CONCLUSIONS
Financial Considerations
The government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant incurred significant,
unpaid debt as a teenager and in his early twenties. Because of his income, he lacked the ability to
make the monthly payments on his numerous credit cards. He still has outstanding bills from this
conduct. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (A history of not
meeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)
apply.
See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC21
6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). 
7
I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and conclude
that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (It was an isolated
incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the
person’s control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not apply because the debts remain unpaid, are not
recent, and are not the result of events or behavior beyond his control. Applicant has not made any
efforts to resolve these debts.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies in part. As
a very young adult, Applicant obtained credit to purchase items for which he did not have cash. With
everyday living expenses, he got behind in his payments, and eventually stopped making payments
on some of his debt. Other debts he regularly and timely paid. He challenged several debts listed on
his credit report because he did not believe he owed the debts. Of the debts challenged, his evidence
establishes that the debt he is alleged to owe for back rent in 2002 may not be legitimate because the
notification of monies due and owing from the apartment complex conflicts with the rent monies due
as set out in the renewal lease. In addition, since the apartment complex purposely chose not to pursue
its legal right, but to harm Applicant’s credit, a serious question arises about the legitimacy of many
of the charges in this bill. He contacted a financial consultant and made payments designated to repay
his overdue store account, which is not reflected in his credit report.
The creditors for the unpaid bills in allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h of the SOR are
barred from collecting these debts under the state 3-year statute of limitations. See State Code. Ann.
§ 15-3-530.  Thus, he receives partial credit for resolution of most of his debt. The State Court of21
Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they
stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and
stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of
limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.
Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that
after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred
claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.
Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).
Elimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended his potential
vulnerability to improper financial inducements because he is no longer “financially overextended”,
but it does not negate his past conduct in not paying his outstanding debts. As a young person,
Applicant got into financial trouble with credit. He over extended himself. He has matured since then.
He has learned to better manage his finances. He pays his bills on time and recently purchased a
house.
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he falsified his answer to Question 22b, but then qualified his22
admission, stating that he thought the question was for any debts not listed on that form (an unidentified form). In light
of his qualified answer, his answer to the allegation in subparagraph 2.a. is deemed a denial.
8
Personal Conduct
The Applicant has denied the government’s allegation of falsification under Guideline E,
subparagraph 2.a of the SOR. The government has established that Applicant’s answer to Question
22b is inaccurate regarding a material fact, the existence of overdue debts. For Personal Conduct
Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire...) and PC DC
E2.A5.1.2.3. (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
material matters to an investigator...) to apply, Applicant must have deliberately falsified his
answer.  At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he knew his had old debts when he answered22
Question 22b. He also credibly testified that he was not concerned about losing his job when he
answered this question and that he was probably careless. He could offer no other reason for his
answer. His admission that he knew he had unpaid debts when he completed his questionnaire is not,
by itself, sufficient to establish he intended to deliberately deceive the government about his debts.
He does not deny his long-term debt problems nor did he in his responses. His failure to provide
immediate information on his debts was the result of sloppiness when completing his security
clearance application. While he should have taken more care, his carelessness does not equal
intentional falsification. When the investigator questioned him about his debt, he willingly discussed
and specifically outlined his financial problems. Because he has been forthcoming about his debts,
I find he did not deliberately fail to provide this information when he completed his security clearance
application. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.
Whole Person Analysis
In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The
objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of
a person’s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to
sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in
considering the “whole person” concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality
of her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,
and careful analysis.
Applicant served honorably for two and one-half years in the Army. He received several
medals for his actions and service during this time. He held a top secret clearance without incident.
As a young adult, he carelessly managed his money by using credit to purchase items he could not
purchase with cash. He overextended his finances and could not met the monthly payments on his
debts. He has since developed better spending habits and lives within his financial means. He has not
incurred significant new, unpaid debt. 
I have weighed the mitigating factors, the reasons for Applicant’s debts, his current family
situation, his present financial situation, his steady employment, and his excellent performance in the
Army against his unpaid debt. I find that the weight of the evidence indicates that he is a person who
9
is trustworthy. He would not act in a manner which would harm his employer or the government.
There is little likelihood he would violate the privacy rights he has agreed to protect because of his
existing debt problems. I conclude he has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to
financial considerations. The personal conduct concern is not substantiated.
