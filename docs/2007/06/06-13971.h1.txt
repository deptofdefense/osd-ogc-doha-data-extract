2
contractor.  He allowed debt to accumulate for seven years, and only commenced efforts at debt
resolution after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued.  He is financially disorganized.  He also
falsified two questions on security clearance applications in 2003 and 2005.  He failed to mitigate
the security concerns about financial considerations and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On November 13, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings1
and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required
by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 ¶ E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 23, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision – security
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)
of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.
DoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD
Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September
1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this
case proceed under the old guidelines.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 11, 2006, and elected to have a hearing
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2007.  The Notice of
Hearing was dated on January 23, 2007, to convene a hearing on February 15, 2007, to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The government offered six exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-6, with Exhibit 6 being a
rebuttal exhibit.  Applicant offered eleven exhibits, marked as exhibits A-K.  I kept the record open
until March 1, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.  He filed three
documents that were marked as Applicant’s Exhibits L, M, and N.  The government had no objection
and Exhibits L, M, and N were admitted.  The government filed one exhibit marked as Exhibit 7,
and without objection it was admitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 26,
2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.i., and 1.j.  He
denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of
same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
Applicant is a 30-year-old engineering technician (explosives operator) employed by a federal
contractor.   He was divorced in 2004 and has one child.   He is a high school graduate and has one2 3
and half years’ credit towards a college degree.   He served in the United States Army from August4
1994 to August 2002.  He earned five Army commendation medals, seven Army achievement

Applicant’s total indebtedness alleged in the SOR was $48,155.  Of that amount, he disputed
three debts that totaled $41,266, he paid six debts totaling $2,397, and two debts for $3,990 and $502
remained unpaid.  On September 22, 2006, he was provided a validation of the $3,990 debt from a
collection agency.   The $502 debt is on the latest credit report.   He claimed that the debt listed18 19
in SOR subparagraph 1.b. was for a mobile home that he and his ex-wife purchased jointly, but his
ex-wife kept after they separated and divorced.   Although the debt did not appear on the most20
recent credit report , he provided no information about whether or not the debt is paid  or unpaid.21
The real estate foreclosure debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h. does not appear on the latest credit
report.   There was correspondence between Applicant and the debtor listed in SOR subparagraph22
1.k., but it did not clarify whether or not the debt was owed.  This debt is not listed in the latest credit
report.   He did not provide corroboration or documentation showing how he disputed the debts.23
Applicant stated that he depended upon his wife to pay bills during several deployments.  He
mentioned one bill that she had not paid in 1997 , and the next time he became aware of his bad24
debts and financial issues involving his ex-wife was during an interview with a Defense Security
Service (DSS) agent in February 2006.   He told the agent he would obtain a copy of his credit25
report and look into the matters.   He took care of his own finances after they separated in 1999.26 27
They were divorced May 6, 2004, but the decree is silent about division of marital property.   His28

Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application, which he caused to
be electronically transmitted on or about September 11, 2003, on which he was required to reply to
the following question: “38. Your financial delinquencies-180 days.  In the last 7 years, have you
ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”; to which he answered “No.”  He also  falsified
material facts on that same SF-86, on which he was required to reply to the following question: “39.
Your financial delinquencies-90 days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”;
to which he answered “No.”  He deliberately failed to list the information about his delinquent debts
as discussed in the previous section.30
Applicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP), executed by him on October 25, 2005, on which he was required to reply to the
following question: “28.a. Your financial delinquencies-180 days.  In the last 7 years, have you
ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”; to which he answered “No.”  He also  falsified
material facts on that same e-QIP, on which he was required to reply to the following question:
“28.b. Your financial delinquencies-90 days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any
debt(s)?”; to which he answered “No.”  He deliberately failed to list the information about his
delinquent debts as discussed in the previous section.31
Applicant was asked why he listed no debts on his security clearance applications:
Q.  And why did you answer, “No?”  
A.  Because at the time when I was filling this out, I did not know I had any financial
delinquencies because nothing had changed between, financially nothing had changed from 2003 to
2005.  And in 2003 I was granted a security clearance.  So I thought that everything was good.  I fill
the questionnaire out.  I got a security clearance.  And I didn’t work there anymore.  I went to
college.  Got out of college.  Went to get work at a different company that required a security
clearance.  And fill this out.  And nothing had changed financially.
Q.  But you had divorced in 2004.
A.  Right.
Q.  That changed.
A.  Right.  Just the marital status.  But I mean, as far as financial obligations within that time
period, I had no reason to think that I had past due accounts because in 2003 when I filled it out and
said, “No,” and I got it, I mean, to the best of my knowledge it was, no.  I got a security clearance
so I thought I had no reason to think any different.  2005 came around.  I applied for another security
clearance.  Same questionnaire.  Nothing had changed from 2003 2005.32
“Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a33
conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of
drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported
by substantial evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  “Substantial evidence”
is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,

POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider
Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing
the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in
conjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal
is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
“whole person concept,” an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at Directive ¶ E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is “clearly
consistent with the interests of national security.”  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,
I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial evidence.”  The
government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying
condition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a
disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating
condition.   Directive ¶ E3.1.15 provides, “The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and33
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by
Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a
See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record34
evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light
of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under
Directive ¶ E3.1.15.”  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).
8
favorable clearance decision.”  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the
government.34
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited.  Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty,
and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  Security clearance
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.
CONCLUSIONS
Financial Considerations
The government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting
financial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an
(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has
a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in paying his debts, since
at least 1999.
Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The
Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The
conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation).  Applicant and his ex-wife separated in 1999.  He stated he did not know where she was
living when he returned from an overseas deployment.  They divorced in 2004.  The divorce decree
made no division of property.  He took care of his own finances from 1999 to 2006.  His monthly
cash flow showed a surplus.  He claimed he did not know about these delinquent debts until February
2006.  What all of this demonstrates is that there is severe financial disorganization in his life.  And
this may indicate how organized or disorganized he might be in handling classified information.
Directive ¶ E.2.2.1.35
Id.36
9
Applicant claimed that many of these debts belonged to his ex-wife, even though they were
jointly established.  He co-signed for the purchase of a mobile home, but provided no documents that
the loan had been paid or unpaid.  To claim no knowledge of his delinquent debts from 1999 until
2006 is not believable.  He knew in 1997 that his former spouse had not paid at least one debt, so
he was on notice that there could be a potential problem.  And he took no action about these debts
until the SOR was filed, about seven months after his DSS interview.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.
There is no evidence of financial counseling, and his debts are neither resolved nor under control.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve bad debts) is inapplicable.  Applicant made little effort at payment until after
the SOR was filed.  He has not resolved his indebtedness.  No other mitigating conditions apply.
I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.
Personal Conduct
Conduct involving questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, or dishonesty could
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.
The government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying
Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) is
the standard.  The operative word is “deliberate.”  Applicant had delinquent debts since at least 1999.
His explanation for the omissions is not credible.  No mitigating conditions apply.  I conclude
Guideline E against Applicant.
Whole Person Analysis
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.”   “Available,35
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be
considered in reaching a determination.”   In evaluating Applicant’s case, in addition to the36
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the “whole person concept” in evaluating
Id.37
10
Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   Applicant ignored his debts37
until the SOR was issued, six months after he claimed he first learned of past due debts..  He has not
adequately addressed the status of the unpaid and disputed debts.
Applicant falsified two security clearance applications.  This is problematic because candor
with the government about a person’s embarrassing information is the crux of a trustworthiness and
security determination.  If a person discloses their personal adverse information, then he or she is
more likely to be trustworthy with confidential or classified information.  The totality of the record
raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant’s ability to protect classified information and
to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government
entrusts its interests and secrets.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant a security clearance.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant

DECISION
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.
