STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On May19, 2000, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).    The Defense Office of Hearings and1
Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 ¶ E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on
March 30, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision – security concerns raised under Guideline F
(Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines
(AG) on December 30, 2005. DoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official
amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is
issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006,
DOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the former guidelines.
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 30, 2006, and elected to have a hearing
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007, and a Notice of
Hearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 7, 2007, to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security
clearance.  The government offered eight exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-8.  Applicant offered no
exhibits  I kept the record open until March 23, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional
documents.  She filed nine documents, received March 23, 2007,  that were marked as Applicant’s
Exhibits A-I.  The government objected to Exhibits B and E, which were sustained.  The government
filed one exhibit marked as Exhibit 9, and without objection it was admitted.  Applicant's Exhibits
A, C, D, F, G, H, and I are admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 15, 2007.
  
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f.,
and 1.k.  She denied all other allegations.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
Applicant is a 44-year-old help desk analyst employed by a federal contractor.   She was2
divorced in 1994,  and has three children.   She is a high school graduate, she has no military service,3
and she has held a security clearance since 1993.4
The SOR detailed Applicant’s financial history, including bankruptcy filings and a list of
delinquent debts, as follows:

Applicant’s second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was dismissed because her attorney had
been disbarred.   She continued it by refiling in October 2004, and she completed the plan14
successfully and she was discharged on July 13, 2006.   The real estate foreclosure that was listed15
in SOR subparagraph 1.k. was stopped, she still owns the property, and her payments are current.16
She sought assistance from a mortgage broker, who helped her improve her credit report, established

in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing
Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two

subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e.   Her delinquent debts have been resolved.18
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider
Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing
the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in
conjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal
is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
“whole person concept,” an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at Directive ¶ E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is “clearly
consistent with the interests of national security.”  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,
I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial evidence.”  The
government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying
condition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a
disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating
condition.   Directive ¶ E3.1.15 provides, “The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and19
inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial
evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a
scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).th
 
See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record20
evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of
pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive
¶ E3.1.15.”  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).
6
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by
Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a
favorable clearance decision.”  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the
government.20
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited.  Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty,
and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  Security clearance
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.
CONCLUSIONS
The government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting
financial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an
(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has
a history of not meeting her financial obligations.  She has been delinquent in paying his debts, since
at least 1999.
Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The
Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4.
(The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications
that the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies.  She sought help in refinancing her
home and established a plan with her mortgage broker to set her on sound financial footing.  Her
delinquent debts are paid and she has her financial affairs under control.

FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve bad debts) is also applicable.  Applicant has demonstrated a consistent effort
through the use of a wage earner plan in bankruptcy and through mortgage refinancing and she is
resolve her indebtedness.  I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.
Whole Person Analysis
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.”   “Available,21
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be
considered in reaching a determination.”   In evaluating Applicant’s case, in addition to the22
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the “whole person” concept in evaluating
Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   Applicant has taken the23
necessary steps to resolve her indebtedness.  The totality of the record  raises no reasonable and
persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the
requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its
interests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s
security clearance.
