APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to
automated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On August 31,
2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
2
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 30,
2007, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant’s
request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.
Rather, it contains a statement from the Applicant summarizing the evidence presented below and
updating the status of her efforts to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy.  The Board cannot consider this
new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.
The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party
has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.  It does not review cases
de novo.  Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge
denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.
