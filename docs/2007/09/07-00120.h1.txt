STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On February 6, 2006, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), which
was originally signed on May 19, 2005.  On February 6, 2006, Applicant also signed an Amendment1
to the SF 86.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security2
clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on April 12, 2007, detailing the basis for its3
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department
of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to
Applicant when the SOR was issued.
On January 4, 2007, Applicant’s senior team leader submitted a “Letter of Compelling Need
for Security Clearance,” requesting that Applicant be granted an interim secret security clearance,
an expedited background investigation, and interviewed so she could be granted a secret security
clearance because she does critical and sensitive work. That letter does not qualify as a letter of
“compelling need” signed by a senior official of the intelligence community (SOIC) or his or her
designee that the services of the individual are deemed essential to operation or mission
accomplishment.4
On June 6, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The
Government was ready to proceed on July 23, 2007. The case was assigned to me on July 25, 2007.
A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 27, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 15, 2007. The
hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted 17 exhibits (Exs.
1-17) and Applicant submitted 11 exhibits (Exs. A-K), all of which were admitted into the record
without objection. The record was left open until August 29, 2007, to give Applicant time to submit
additional documents. By memorandum dated August 31, 2007, the Government forwarded
additional documents submitted by Applicant, without objection. These documents were identified
as Ex. L and admitted. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 27, 2007.
MOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS
On July 23, 2007, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR by adding a new
allegation under subparagraph 1 as follows:
Tr. 40.5
Id. 54.6
Id. at 60.7
Id. at 58, 60-62.8
Ex. J (Agreement for Consulting Services, Certified Foreclosure Consultant, dated January 8, 2003).9

1.1  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in April 2007 levied upon your earnings
from your employer [employer’s name] for past due federal income tax for the year
2001. In May 2007 the IRS commenced collecting past due income taxes by
garnishment from your [employer’s name] earnings.
In the absence of an objection, the Government’s request to amend the SOR was granted.
Accordingly, the SOR is amended as stated above.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e through 1.l.
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the allegations in
subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 42 years old and works as a technical librarian/editor for a defense contractor.
She has worked at the same job, minus 15 months, since 1989. She has an associate’s degree in
science and chemistry, a bachelor’s degree in English, and is completing a master’s degree in
professional writing. Her employer is funding her graduate education.  She was in the Air National5
Guard part-time from 1989 until her resignation in 2004. Applicant admits that her secret clearance
was revoked on September 9, 2004, due to financial issues.6
Applicant has three children, aged 18, 14, and 6. The two older children are from her first
marriage in 1988, which ended in divorce in 1994. Since 1995, a child support order for the two
older children in the amount of $496 per month has been in effect. In 2007, her ex-husband was in
a serious car accident related to work. On May 30, 2007, he ceased paying child support because he
did not believe he would recover and because he was unemployed.  She is trying to modify the child7
support order for a reduced payment while he recuperates.8
After her divorce, Applicant purchased a home in 1994 for $89,000, with a Veteran’s
Administration loan. She owned the house four years before she remarried. The property was
foreclosed in June 2003. Prior to the foreclosure, she worked with a foreclosure consulting service
to resolve her mortgage issues.  After the foreclosure, she worked with a federal credit union and9
they assisted her in streamlining her personal debts and car loan.

In 1998, Applicant remarried, and her youngest child is a result of this marriage. When they
married, he was the bread winner, earning more than her.  With two incomes and a stable financial10
situation, in 1999, Applicant borrowed $30,000 from her profit-sharing plan to invest in a music
studio in the basement of the house for her husband.  He wanted to start his own business, so she11
thought it would be a good investment. Their family was forbidden to enter his music studio. After
the birth of their child in December 2000, they agreed that Applicant would stay home and they
would financially be provided for with the use of her profit-sharing, his full-time job, and her miliary
monthly drill checks. In January 2002, he was laid off from his full-time job. The Air National Guard
was able to put her on active duty with intermittent orders.  Eventually, they were both re-employed,12
and their lives stabilized. In 2004, Applicant learned that her husband was using alcohol and drugs.
Their pastor counseled them but her husband refused to go through any treatment program. 
In August 2000, March 2002, and October 2002, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection
under Chapter 13. The bankruptcies were dismissed for failure to make payments. In June 2004, she
filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. The bankruptcy was dismissed for failure to
complete the required filing. Applicant stated that she filed these bankruptcies based on the advice
she received from her attorney.  All bankruptcies reflected the same debts.13 14
On October 14, 2005, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. Her debts
were discharged on January 25, 2006. Her liabilities totaled $46,796. Her assets totaled $3,350.
On April 4, 2007, Applicant and her husband separated after he sold off most of the
equipment in the studio.  Her divorce will be final in 2008. She was obligated to pay back the loan15
she received from her profit sharing through payroll deductions shortly after it was approved. She
filed for child support for their youngest child.  Applicant provided a copy of consent order for child16
support filed against her estranged husband.  Effective September 1, 2007, he was ordered to pay17
$336 per month for his now six-year-old daughter.
The SOR lists five outstanding delinquent debts totaling $13,220. The debts are as follows:

Id. at 52.19
Id. at 53; Ex. 13 (Bankruptcy Petition, Schedule F).20

!Tax lien for $1,115 was filed against her for unpaid state income taxes. Tax lien for
$8,546 was filed against her for the tax years 1999 and 2000. Both of these debts are
being paid through a payroll deduction of $224 per month.18
!Two medical debts for $272. Applicant is contesting these charges with the three
credit bureaus.19
!Telephone debt for $1,304 in collections. This debt was covered in the 2005
Chapter 7 bankruptcy.20
!Student loan for $1,983 in collections. She has a payment plan for this loan, which
is $50 a week, starting September 2007.21
!IRS levied a garnishment on Applicant’s earnings in April 2007 for past due federal
income tax for the year 2001. A payment of $100 a month is deducted directly from
her pay for this debt.
Applicant stated this about her financial situation: “I’ve been honest with all of my immediate
supervisors and coworkers, and my ministerial staff at my church about my financial challenges and
have remained loyal and honest to my employer. And my integrity has never had need to be
questioned.”22
Applicant submitted five character reference letters from colleagues at work.  They23
enthusiastically endorsed her security clearance application. They commented that Applicant “has
shown a high degree of integrity, responsibility, resourcefulness, and leadership.”  Another stated24
“Although she has had to struggle to make ends meet – she maintains an upbeat and positive attitude.
She is a faithful member of her church, attending regularly with her children. She helps with many
outreach programs sponsored by her church.”25

Applicant has been a member of her church since 1998. The pastor of the church attested to
her character.  He stated:26
I counseled [Applicant] through all of these months and continue to meet with her
twice a week to discuss her finances, her mental state and her plans, and she remains
positive and working on a plan to become credit worthy again. She has separated
from her husband as a result of his drug and alcohol use and has purposed [sic] to file
for divorce next year and move on with her life. 
Applicant earns $60,000 a year. She also does freelance writing, which amounts to about
$300 to $500 per month.  She also accepted a part-time administrative position beginning August27
30, 2007, working 10-15 hours per week. She will be paid $100 weekly, not to exceed $400 a
month.28
POLICIES
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”  As Commander in Chief, the President has29
“the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person
access to such information.”  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to30
grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  An applicant has the ultimate burden of31
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her
security clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant32
should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such
sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a33
determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not
Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.34
8
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a
clearance.34
The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and
mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed
in the Directive and AG ¶ 2(a).
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the
following conclusions.
Guideline ¶ 18 articulates the Government’s concern regarding financial problems. “Failure
or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate
poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal
acts to generate funds.”
The Government has proved a prima facie case for financial considerations. Applicant has
a long history of financial problems going back to 1998. In January 2006, her debts were discharged
in bankruptcy. Subsequently, she accumulated five delinquent debts, totaling $13,220. Accordingly,
Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions ¶ 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy
debts) and ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.
Various factors can mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Applicant lost her
house to foreclosure. Her two marriages assisted in unraveling her finances. She divorced one
husband and plans on divorcing her second husband in 2008. Her second marriage included her
unemployment caused by birth of a baby and her spouse was laid off from work. She bounced back
from a bankruptcy discharge in 2006. She has paid the outstanding tax debts and student loan that
were not dischargeable in bankruptcy. She challenged two debts are on her credit report with three
credit bureaus. Moreover, Applicant has demonstrated that her financial problems are unlikely to
recur. She continues to do freelance writing and earns an additional $300 to $500 each month.
Moreover, she had found a part-time job and will continue to enhance her financial coffers. Hence,
Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions ¶ 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial
problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted
responsibly under the circumstances), ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling
for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under
control), ¶ 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts), and ¶ 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the
9
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) apply.
I now turn to the general factors of the whole person concept. Applicant is 42 years old and
has obviously had some financial setbacks in her life starting around 1998. She is keenly aware of
her delinquent debts and sought both financial and pastoral counseling. She credibly testified that
she works in an environment where she excels. This is evidenced by her job paying for her master’s
education. Applicant has matured during her financial downturn. She did not always get the best
advice when seeking it from professionals, when dealing with the foreclosure of her house or filing
numerous bankruptcies that were dismissed for failure to make payments. Yet, she persevered. She
enhances her finances by doing freelance writing and she recently found a part-time job. She is well
on her way to becoming financially solvent. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable
for access to classified information.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT

DECISION
