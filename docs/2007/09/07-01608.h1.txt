Applicant is 53 years old and has worked as an electronics technician for a defense contractor
for the past 10 years. On several occasions from1972 to May 2006, he drank alcohol excessively and
to the point of intoxication. In 2005, he was charged with DUI and served 120 days in jail, with
probation for two years. His probation will end in October 2008. Applicant ceased drinking alcohol
in May 2006 and has been alcohol-free since then. He has not mitigated the alcohol consumption
security concerns. He has mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.
Ex. 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing, dated May 3, 2006).1
Pursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as2
amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program  (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On May 3, 2006, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation
Processing (e-QIP).  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a1
security clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  on June 20, 2007, detailing the basis2
for its decision–security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Revised
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department
of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to
Applicant when the SOR was issued.
In a sworn statement, dated July 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and
requested a hearing. Department Counsel indicated the Government was ready to proceed on August
8, 2007. This case was assigned to me on August 9, 2007. Applicant’s attorney filed a Notice of
Appearance on August 10, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 14, 2007, scheduling
the hearing for August 29, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the
Government submitted exhibits 1-6, and Applicant submitted exhibits A-D, all of which were
admitted into the record without objection. The record was left open to give Applicant time to submit
additional documents. Applicant submitted two additional documents, which were not objected to
by the Government. The documents were identified as exhibits E and F and admitted. The transcript
(Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.
MOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS
On August 7, 2007, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR by adding a new
allegation under subparagraph 1 and adding paragraph 2 as follows:
1.g  In about January 1986, you were charged with Driving Under the
Influence by the [state] Police Department.
2. Guideline E:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified
information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers
during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the
security clearance process. Available information raising this concern shows that:
2.a  You falsified material facts on a Standard Form 86, Security Clearance
Application, executed by you under date November 3, 2000, in response to “Question
24. Your Police Record – Alcohol/Drug Offense. Have you ever been charged with
or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report

information regardless of whether the record in your case has been “sealed” or
otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is for
certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court
issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C.
3607.” You deliberately failed to disclose that you had been arrested on April 21,
2000 and charged with illegal operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of
alcohol/drugs. You were found guilty as charged on June 15, 2000.
Applicant objected to the amendment of the SOR. In a written response, Applicant stated
“[t]he applicant has prepared his defense, the trial date has been set, and to now permit such an
amendment would require him to alter his defense to his detriment.” As to subparagraph 1.g,
Applicant argued that too much time had elapsed to review records in a 1986 incident, since those
records may no longer be available. On August 22, 2007, the Government filed a reply objecting to
Applicant’s objection to amend the SOR. At the hearing, after hearing the parties’ argument, the
Government’s motion to amend the SOR was granted.3
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted all the factual allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 53 years old and has worked as an electronics technician for a defense contractor
for the last 10 years. He served in the Navy from 1980-1996, and retired as a Petty Officer First Class
(E-6) with an honorable discharge. He is married and has a 13-year-old daughter.
Applicant started drinking at the age of 18. He continued to consume alcohol during his tour
in the Navy. In 1986, in two separate incidents when he was out drinking, Applicant was charged
with DUI. He admitted these allegations, but believes that both cases were dismissed.  The record4
is devoid of whether the charges were dismissed.
On April 21, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with illegal operation of a motor
vehicle under the influence of alcohol/drugs. On June 15, 2000, he pled guilty as charged. He was
fined, sentenced to community service, and his driver’s license was suspended for one year. He
applied for and received a permit so he could continue to drive to and from work.
Applicant executed a SF 86 in 2000.  In response to Question 24, “Your Police Record –5
Alcohol/Drug Offense. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to
alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case
has been “sealed” or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement
is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued
Tr. 7-20. During the hearing, Applicant argued that the Government’s Ex 2 (SF 86), did not have a signature6
page and that the Government was relying on the signature date that Applicant authorized release of his medical records.

and expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607,” Applicant  failed
to disclose that he was found guilty of a DUI in June 2000.  Applicant stated that he did not6
intentionally omit this information.  Applicant objected to the admissibility of Ex. 2 because of7
authentication. The document proffered by the Government was unsigned. The Government relied
on the date on the “Authorization for Release of Medical Information,” signed by Applicant on
October 31, 2000. Applicant indicated that he signed the SF 86 on a different date, and he proffered
a sworn statement indicating that the document was executed on March 28, 2000.  He too relied on8
the date on the “Authorization for Release of Medical Information” form and did not proffer an
executed copy of the 2000 SF 86. In May 2007, Applicant completed interrogatories. During the
interview, Applicant made this statement: “the subject [Applicant] volunteered that in the summer
of 1999 or 2000 (exact date not recalled) he was arrested for DUI.”9
For three weeks in 2004, Applicant was treated at an inpatient alcohol-related program. A
certificate from the facility indicated that Applicant successfully completed the 10-week outpatient
program at an institute recognized for providing alcohol and drug abuse treatment.10
In April 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and evading the police. He pled
guilty to DUI and was sentenced to two years in jail, which was suspended after he served 120 days.
He was ordered to serve 100 hours of community service and two years of probation. His driver’s
license was suspended for three years starting in 2006. The suspension was reduced to a year based
on the installation of a special Breathalyzer device in his car. He has to breathe into the Breathalyzer
device before he could start the car. The system would not allow him to drive if he has consumed
alcohol. The charge for evading the police was nolle prossed. The probation will end in October
2008.
In December 2006, Applicant participated in an alcohol counseling and education program
and completed the program in July 2007, which included counseling and attendance at local
meetings to talk about alcohol issues.  In May 2006, Applicant ceased drinking alcohol.11 12
On July 13, 2007, Applicant received an assessment of his condition from the institute that
treated him for his alcohol problem. His diagnostic impression was alcohol abuse, sustained and in

full remission. The report revealed that Applicant is not in need of any treatment at this time and his
prognosis for continued long-term recovery was good.13
Two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. One witness, who has worked with Applicant
for over a year, was skeptical about Applicant returning to work after treatment in an alcohol
rehabilitation program. This witness indicated that when Applicant returned to work, he was more
focused than ever and was once again a good worker.  The other witness was in the Navy with14
Applicant and is currently his supervisor.  He was aware of Applicant’s issues with alcohol. He15
stated that after his incarceration, Applicant was “much more comfortable with himself,” and his job
performance has never been an issue.16
POLICIES
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”  As Commander in Chief, the President has17
“the authorities to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person
access to such information.”  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to18
grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clear
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  An applicant has the ultimate burden of19
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her
security clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant20
should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such
sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a21
determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a
clearance.22
7
The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and
mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed
in the Directive and AG ¶ 2(a).
CONCLUSIONS
I carefully considered all facts in evidence and the applicable legal standards, and I reach the
following conclusions.
Alcohol Consumption
Alcohol Consumption  may be a security concern because “excessive alcohol consumption
often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.” (AG ¶ 21)
Applicant has four different DUIs. There were two DUIs in 1986, and in each case he was
arrested and spent a night in jail. However, the record does not reveal why those charges were
dismissed. Applicant had a 2000 DUI and was found guilty. He was ordered to serve 100 hours of
community service and he lost his driver’s license but got it back after a Breathalyzer interlock
system was installed, which prohibits Applicant from driving if he has consumed alcohol. In April
2005, he was charged with DUI. He was sentenced to 20 months of incarceration, but served 120
days. He was also sentenced to two years of probation. The probation will not end until October
2008. On July 13, 2007, he received a diagnostic impression of alcohol abuse, sustained and in full
remission and favorable prognosis for recovery. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying
Conditions AG ¶ 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,
regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and
AG ¶ 22d (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker
who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) apply.
Various factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. Applicant participated
in a 10-week alcohol treatment program in 2004. Then in December 2006 through July 2007, he was
an inpatient at an alcohol treatment program. In July 2007, his diagnostic impression was alcohol
abuse, sustained and in full remission and favorable prognosis for recovery. Applicant ceased
drinking alcohol in May 2006. His driver’s license was suspended for three years starting in 2006.
The suspension was reduced to a year, because of the installation of a special Breathalyzer device,
which will not allow him to drive if he has been drinking. His probation continues through October
2008. Applicant has worked hard to combat his abuse of alcohol. I applaud him for being alcohol-
free for more than a year. Because his probation will not cease until October 2008, I cannot conclude
that Applicant will not abuse alcohol during this probationary period. More time is needed for
Applicant to prove that his excessive alcohol consumption and periodic drinking and driving days
are over. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions AG ¶ 23(b) (the individual
acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken
to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or
8
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) and AG ¶ 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed
inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance
with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a
similar organization ad has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional
or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment
program) do not apply.
Personal Conduct
“Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to
comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to
provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to
cooperate with the security clearance process.” (AG ¶ 15)
In response to a question on the 2000 SF 86, he failed to disclose that he was found guilty
of a DUI in June 2000. The document proffered by the Government, Ex. 2, is unsigned by Applicant.
Moreover, the date on the exhibit is the date Applicant offered release of medical information.
Moreover, in the SF 86 executed by Applicant on May 3, 2006, he does not list either the 1986 or
2000 DUIs. However, during an interview on May 25, 2007, Applicant volunteered information
about his 2000 DUI. Consequently, I conclude that the Government received an honest answer to the
question when Applicant volunteered information about his 2000 DUI during an interview in May
2007. Thus, AG ¶ 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply.
I considered all of the evidence in the case. I have also considered the “whole person”
concept in evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.
Applicant has made substantial progress in dealing with his long history of excessively consuming
alcohol. He participated in a 10-week  alcohol treatment program in 2004. Moreover, he participated
in a different alcohol treatment program from December 2006 to July 2007. His diagnosis was
alcohol abuse, sustained and in full remission and favorable prognosis for recovery. He has been
alcohol-free since May 2006. However, his behavior is still being monitored by the State and his
probation will end in October 2008. I conclude that while Applicant is on probation, he is still a
potential risk. Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable
for access to classified information.
