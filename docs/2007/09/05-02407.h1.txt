remaining financially solvent. Applicant presented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or
mitigate the security concern. Clearance is granted.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On September 24, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
March 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated
January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  2
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer dated and notarized on April 7, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2007. On June 7, 2007,
DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on July 11, 2007.  The hearing was
held as scheduled. On July 20, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). I left the record open until
July 20, 2007 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material. Tr. 74-79, 91.
He timely submitted additional material, which was marked and appended to the record.
FINDINGS OF FACT 
In his reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted all indebtedness. His admissions are incorporated
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make
the following findings of fact.

Applicant is 41 years old.  He graduated from high school in June 1984. Tr. 62. He attended3
community college from August 1984 to May 1986, and was a awarded an associate of arts degree
in computer science. He served in the U.S. Army from November 1986 to August 1997, and was
honorably discharged. Tr. 65. He was previously married from October 1989 to September 1998.
That marriage ended by divorce. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 16 and 12. He pays
$892 per month in child support plus their health care insurance premiums. He remarried in
September 2005 and he has a one-year-old daughter from his current marriage. Tr. 22-23. He has
been employed by a defense contractor as a senior applications engineer since August 2006. Tr. 45.
He has also taken on a part-time job as a security guard.
Applicant has successfully held a security clearance that was initially granted shortly after
enlisting in the Army. Tr. 16. He is seeking to retain a security clearance for his current employment.
Applicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR lists 17 unpaid debts ranging from
$34 to $18,760, exceeding $40,000. Two of the largest debts are for automobile loans in which
Applicant fell behind during his separation and divorce from his first wife. Of those 17 debts,
Applicant has paid off four debts, made payment arrangements on 8 debts, and attempting settlement
of five debts. Two debts listed in the SOR are duplicates.
Applicant attributes the debts to bad management by him and his ex-wife, the break-up of
a relationship with a girlfriend after his divorce, expenses associated with his mother passing away
in 2004, and costs of moving after his divorce, and break-up with his then girlfriend. One of the
larger debts was for loan he co-signed for an automobile his ex-wife kept. The automobile was
repossessed after she failed to make payments and Applicant was held responsible for the debt. After
he remarried, his second wife had a difficult pregnancy that lead to additional unplanned expenses.
To overcome his indebtedness, he sought and secured a better paying job and has taken on
a part-time job. His post-hearing materials show an earnest effort to document good-faith attempts
to achieve financial stability. He recognizes the importance of overcoming his indebtedness and the
adverse impact non-payment of debts may have on his clearance. He is also enrolled in and is
receiving financial counseling. His budget reflects a net remainder of $654 per month.  Tr. 57. With
his higher paying job and part-time job, Applicant is able to support his family and address his past
due debts. His most recent work performance evaluation indicates above average performance.
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider
the “Adjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information”
(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying
Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified information.

These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline ¶ 2. An administrative
judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the
entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole person
concept,” an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at Guideline ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being
considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”
Guideline ¶ 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing
controverted facts by “substantial evidence,”  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that4
it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to
classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying
condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.
The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
Revised Guidelines at 13-14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).

DC 19(a) is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.”

DC 19(c) is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.”

whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should
be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal
precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following
with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to6
significant unpaid debts.  Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to general funds to meet
financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information.
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.
His history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline7 8
F.  The record is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.
Applicant received credit in mitigation.  The most pertinent mitigating condition is the fourth
MC  of Guideline F, because Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay or settle the 17 debts9
listed in the SOR. His good-faith effort is established by his actions. He sought out and secured a
better paying job and took on additional part-time job. He also receives credit in mitigation under the
second MC  as a result of his wife’s difficult pregnancy, his mother’s death, and his separation and10
MC 20(c) “the person has received counseling or is receiving counseling for the problem and /or there are
11
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.”

divorce from his first wife. Lastly, Applicant receives credit under the third MC for getting to the
source of his problem and that is understanding how he got into financial trouble and learning how
to manage his finances by taking a financial counseling course.11
And unlike many applicants in financial cases, Applicant verified his actions by providing
substantial documentary proof of payment or settlement of his debts.  Applicant has addressed his
financial problems, has cash left over, and is otherwise living within his means. Although he can be
faulted for taking too long to address his indebtedness, he has since taken action to minimize and
overcome concerns about his financial situation. His history of successfully maintaining a security
clearance without incident stemming back to his Army service and his positive employment record
weigh heavily in his favor in assessing his security eligibility under the “whole person” analysis.
Based on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Likewise, he has met his
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.
518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”  and supporting evidence, my12
application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my
responsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has mitigated and overcome the government’s case.
For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.
FORMAL FINDINGS

Subparagraphs a - q: For Applicant
DECISION
In light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.
