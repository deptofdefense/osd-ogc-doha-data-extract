SYNOPSIS
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2005. In July 2006, the bankruptcy was
dismissed. Applicant owes the IRS for unpaid income taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002,
2003, and 2004.  She has resolved or entered into repayment plans pertaining to several of her debts.
However, she continues to have issues dealing with financial irresponsibility.  Her student loan
account is past due and six debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. Trustworthiness concerns
remain due to Applicant's financial problems and her deliberately misleading statement to an
investigator pertaining to the status of her Chapter 13 debt repayment plan. She has not met her
burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal
conduct. Applicant's eligibility for an assignment to a sensitive position is denied.
 This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum1
from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled "Adjudication of Trustworthiness
Cases," dated November 19, 2004.

STATEMENT OF CASE
On October 3, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust. The
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive"); and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,
approved December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006.  On February 1, 2007, DOHA issued1
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in
essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.
In a sworn statement dated March 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and
elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Her response was
received by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals on March 23, 2007. On April 16, 2007,
Department Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive. The case was
assigned to me on August 3, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 6, 2007, scheduling
the hearing for August 29, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered nine
exhibits which were admitted as Government (Gov) Exhibits 1-9 without objection.  Applicant
offered 10 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-J without objection.  The
record was held open until September 12, 2007, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit
additional documents.  On September 5, 2007, Applicant requested an additional week to submit
additional documents.  Her request was granted until September 19, 2007. Applicant timely
submitted a ten-page document which was marked and admitted as AE K without objection. The
transcript (Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.  
FINDINGS OF FACT
In her SOR response, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i and admits to all the
remaining SOR allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who
is seeking a position of public trust.  She is single and has no children.  She is trained as a nurse and2 3
is currently a case manager with a healthcare company that works on a government contract.  She
has worked for the company for approximately two years.   4

On October 3, 2005, Applicant completed a public trust position application (SF 85-P).  In5
response to question "19. Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy, Liens, Judgments. In the last 7 years
have you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared
bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against you for a debt?"
Applicant listed a bankruptcy filed on August 10, 2005.  6
Applicant filed for bankruptcy on June 29, 2005.   The following debts were included in7
Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy: a $500 account owed to a loan company (SOR ¶ 1.b, Tr. at 46;
Gov 6 at 5); a $100 account owed to a water company (SOR ¶ 1.c, Tr. at 47-48); a student loan
account, approximate balance $12,000 (SOR ¶ 1.d; Tr. at 48; Gov 3 at 7); a $1,000 medical account
(SOR ¶ 1.e; Tr. at 49; Gov 6 at 5); a $2,000 medical account (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 49-50; Gov 6 at 5);
a $1,105 credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.g; Tr. at 50; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 2 at 3); a $14,873 automobile
loan (SOR ¶ 1.h; Tr. at 51-53; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 3, 10; AE D); a $10,000 automobile
loan (SOR ¶ 1.i; Tr. at 51-53; Gov 2 at 2); a $3,000 mortgage account (SOR ¶ 1.j; Tr. at 53; Gov 2
at 2); a $700 credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.k, Tr. at 53; Gov 6 at 5); and a $2,071 computer account
(SOR ¶ 1.l; Tr. at 54; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 6 at 2).  
Applicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $24,672 for unpaid taxes
and penalties for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.8
 
On February 22, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator in conjunction with her
background investigation. The investigator asked her for more information about her bankruptcy.
She told the investigator that she filed for bankruptcy in July 2005. She also told him that she pays
$715 a month to a bankruptcy trustee, and is current on her payments.  9
On February 24, 2006, the investigator reviewed Applicant's bankruptcy records at the U.S.
Bankruptcy court. The records indicate that Applicant was required to pay $822 per month toward
her Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  She owed a total of $46,854. She began making payments on August
8, 2005.  The record indicates that Applicant was approximately $1,861 in arrears as of February
2006.   10
At hearing, Applicant admits that when she was interviewed by the investigator, she was
aware that she was behind at least one payment towards her Chapter 13 plan. She thought that she

could rectify the matter by making a payment bringing her Chapter 13 plan up-to-date.  She admits11
that part of the reason she did not disclose that she was behind on her Chapter 13 payment plan was
out of concern over her trustworthiness position.  In the future, should she fill out a trustworthiness12
application, she intends to provide truthful information. She has learned a painful lesson.13
Applicant voluntarily dismissed the bankruptcy in July 2006.   She decided to sell her14
condominium and pay for some debts with the profits of the sale.  She made approximately $30,000
on the sale of the condominium.  Her bankruptcy attorney advised her to make payments towards15
her car, the IRS debt and a $300 state debt. He advised her not to arrange payments with her other
creditors unless they contacted her.  She paid $5,000 towards her auto loan and $8,000 towards her16
federal taxes.   She paid the $300 state tax debt and $500 towards some credit cards. She spent all17
of the $30,000 that she made from the sale of her condominium.18
On November 6, 2006, a federal tax lien in the amount of $24,672 was entered against
Applicant for unpaid income taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  On19
December 5, 2006, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS.  She agreed to pay
$600 per month due on the 10th of each month with payments starting on January 10, 2007.  She20
claims that she is making timely payments towards her repayment agreement. Two weeks prior to
the hearing, she sent a request for revision to the IRS asking that her payments be reduced to $500
per month.  No documentation was provided indicating that Applicant is making timely payments21
on her IRS debt. 
Applicant testified at the hearing that she requested a forbearance on her student loan for
approximately one year.   She testified that prior to her forbearance request, she paid approximately22
$160 per month towards her student loans. It was her belief that the forbearance request was

approved.  Post-hearing, she provided a copy of a request for forbearance, dated July 31, 2007.23 24
The balance on her student loan is $18,545.80. She is approximately $1,249 past due on her student
loan payments.   She is attempting to work a payment plan to catch up on her arrears.25 26
Applicant's automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.h) is now up-to-date. She paid $5,000 toward the
automobile loan after her bankruptcy was dismissed.  She has been making regular payments and27
the automobile loan is no longer delinquent.  The automobile loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is a28
duplicate of the automobile loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h.29
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j which was related to condo fees and other expenses was
satisfied at the time Applicant sold her condominium.  30
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l remain unresolved. None of
the creditors have contacted Applicant and she has not contacted the creditors in order to resolve
these accounts.  She claims that the accounts with SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f are the same.  There is31
nothing in the record evidence that indicates these are two separate medical accounts.  I find for
Applicant with respect to SOR ¶ 1.e.  
Applicant states that cause for her financial problems was due to overspending and living
beyond her means.  She attended two financial counseling sessions approximately two years prior32
to filing bankruptcy.  Based on the advice of her attorney, she is waiting for her creditors to contact33
her before attempting to resolve her delinquent accounts.34

Applicant's monthly take home pay is $3,200.  Post-hearing, she submitted a budget. Her35
total monthly expenses are approximately $2,350.  Based on these figures, she has approximately36
$850 left over each month after expenses. Her budget does not include her $600 monthly payment
towards the IRS debt or her monthly car payment of $471.90.  Including the monthly tax payment37
and the car payment, Applicant has a negative balance of $221.90. 
Applicant's supervisor comments that Applicant has consistently demonstrated "a high degree
of competency, dependability, and professionalism in her daily work"  She states she is a valuable
employee.   Applicant often gets favorable remarks from clients.  She has received several letters38 39
of appreciation and awards.  Her performance reports have been favorable. Her most recent40
evaluation which closed out on March 31, 2007, indicates that she consistently meets and often
exceeds day to day expectations.41
POLICIES
The President has “the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position …
that will give that person access to such information.”   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding42
Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and
procedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the
executive branch. 
To be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must
meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,
effective September 1, 2006.  The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth personnel security
guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.
The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's
means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,
lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can
raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect

classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.43
Guideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with
the security clearance process.44
Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth
and discussed in the conclusions below.
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.”    An administrative45
judge must apply the “whole person concept,” and consider and carefully weigh the available,
reliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following46
factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)
the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   47
Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR
that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified
information.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,48
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is49
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”  Any doubt50
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be
 Directive, ¶ E2.2.2.51
9
resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations51
for access to sensitive positions.
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government
has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,
and Guideline E - Personal Conduct. 
Financial Considerations
Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) ¶ 19(a)
(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and ¶19(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations)
apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts including a $24,000 tax debt for
unpaid taxes related to tax years 1999 - 2004. In addition, she currently has six unresolved delinquent
debts with a total approximate balance of over $6,400. Many of these debts have been delinquent for
several years. She is in the process of requesting a forbearance on her student loan account. Currently,
the student loan account is past due $1,249.
FC DC ¶ 19(c) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence
of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt)
also applies.  Applicant admits that her financial problems were the result of her irresponsible and
spending habits and living beyond her means. 
Several Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply.  Applicant
has a history of financial irresponsibility spanning several years. She still has significant financial
problems. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC ¶ 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).
There is no evidence to support the application of FC MC ¶ 20(b) (the conditions that resulted
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant's problems were not caused by
circumstances beyond her control.  
 FC MC ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) also does not apply.
Applicant received financial counseling a few years prior to filing bankruptcy.  Although, she has
resolved some of her accounts and has taken steps to enter into the payment plans with the IRS and
her student loans, it is too soon to conclude that her financial problems are under control based on her
track record of financial irresponsibility. She recently entered into a  payment plan with the IRS.
Applicant's student loan accounts are currently delinquent and not in forbearance. Applicant has six
10
other unresolved delinquent accounts. Her monthly budget indicates that her expenses are more than
her income. As such, I conclude her financial situation is unlikely to be resolved in the future.
FC MC ¶ 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts) is applicable, in part. Applicant has brought her automobile loan payments
up to date.  She resolved the debt is SOR ¶ 1.j. She is attempting to repay her IRS and student loan
debts.  However, several accounts remain unresolved and Applicant has made no attempt to resolve
the accounts. As such, I give FC MC ¶ 20(d) less weight.
Although Applicant has taken steps to resolve her financial problems, her financial situation
remains unstable. She has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern.
Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Personal Conduct
 
Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the
central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification
of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a
security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done
knowingly and willfully.  
In this case, Applicant told the investigator assigned to conduct her background investigation
that she was current on her Chapter 13 repayment plan while knowing that she was at least one
payment behind.  She told the investigator that she was current because she thought she could bring
the Chapter 13 repayment plan up to date. She was concerned about her application for a
trustworthiness position. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) ¶ 16(b) (deliberately
providing  false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,
security official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative) applies.
Applicant maintains that she did not intend to mislead the investigator about the status of her Chapter
13 payment plan, but admits that she knew her payments towards the Chapter 13 plan were delinquent
when she was interviewed by the investigator.  She told him that she was current on her payment plan
despite knowing this. Although, she claims she had no intent to mislead, she deliberately provided
false information to the investigator.  
I find none of the personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant's case.
PC MC ¶ 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment,
or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not apply. Applicant never attempted to
correct the misleading information provided to the investigator. 
PC MC ¶ 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so
infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable.
Applicant's admission that she misled the investigator casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness
and good judgement. Her explanation that she intended to make payments towards the Chapter 13 to
bring it current is not a sufficient justification for lying to the investigator. Applicants are required
to provide truthful and correct information to the government during their background investigations.
11
Applicant did not meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by her
deliberate misleading statement provided to the investigator conducting her background investigation.
Guideline E is concluded against Applicant.
In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The
objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of
a person’s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to
sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in
considering the “whole person” concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality
of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature
thinking, and careful analysis.
I have considered all the evidence and the “whole person” in evaluating Applicant’s
trustworthiness. While Applicant has favorable performance reviews and is highly regarded by her
supervisors and coworkers, trustworthiness concerns remain due to her deliberate misleading
statements to the investigator conducting her background investigation, her history of financial
irresponsibility, and her current unstable financial situation. Based on the evidence in the record, it
is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to
sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.
