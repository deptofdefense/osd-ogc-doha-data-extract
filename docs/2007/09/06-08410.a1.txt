decision—trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline
J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the
written record.  On January 30, 2007, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Mary E.
Henry denied Applicant’s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed
pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1
Applicant’s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.
Rather, it contains a request that the Board review Applicant’s complete file and reverse the Judge’s
adverse determination.
The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party
has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.  It does not review cases
de novo.  Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge
denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.
