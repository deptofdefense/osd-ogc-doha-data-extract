Applicant used marijuana from June 2001 through November 2006.  He also
purchased marijuana from June 2001 through June 2005. He used marijuana after
submitting his security clearance application and during the background investigation
for his security clearance.  During that interview, he stated he had no plans to use
marijuana in the future. He failed to mitigate security concerns relating to drug
involvement and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On February 16, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
March 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  2
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal
Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer dated and notarized on March 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2007. On April 20,
2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on June 13, 2007.  The
hearing was held as scheduled. On June 26, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). I left the
record open until June 22, 2007 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material.
Tr. 17-18. He did not submit any additional material.
PROCEDURAL RULINGS
Amendment of Statement of Reasons
Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.b.to read, “During the period June 2001
G E  1 ,  su p ra  n .  1 . i s  th e  b a s is  fo r  th e  fa c t s  i n  th is  p a ra gra p h ,  un le ss  o th e rw ise  s ta te d .3

through June 2005, you purchased marijuana.”
Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.c. to read, “In 2006, you used marijuana after
submitting your security clearance application.” 
Applicant did not object to the SOR amendments, and the motion was granted. Tr. 57.
FINDINGS OF FACT 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant submitted a mixed response of admissions and
a denial regarding  the SOR allegations of illegal drug use. His admissions are incorporated herein
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the
following findings of fact.  
Applicant is 24 years old.  He received a bachelor of science degree in geographic science3
in May 2005. He has no military service, and he has never been married. Applicant has been
employed by a government contractor as an assistant geographic information systems production
manager since January 2006. Tr. 20, 49-50. His grade point average in college was 3.45. Tr. 49. He
is a first-time applicant for a security clearance.
Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between June 2001 and November 2006.
Applicant began smoking marijuana at age 18 for the following reasons:
I mean I don’t know. I mean it was just kind of something I did when I was
hanging out with friends, usually outside. It wasn’t, you know, it was something that
a couple of my buddies did and I tried it a time or two and it didn’t  seem completely
harmful. It didn’t affect any sort of judgment of mine in situations and places. The
setting and location of where I was doing it, you know, was completely, you know,
safe environment for me and I felt – I never felt threatened, I never felt like it was
something that I would endanger myself or anyone around me. (Describing the
environment in which he smoked marijuana) Usually either on hiking trips or
climbing trips, just kind of something you did at the end of the day and, you know,
just kind of [a] way of calming down. Tr. 27.
Applicant stated his marijuana use declined in order to “focus more on school.  My you
know, overall drug use declined quite a bit my junior and senior year.” After college, his marijuana
use declined even more when he began associating less with people who used marijuana. Tr 32. He
stated “it was a liberating feeling, not feeling like I had to be dependent on getting high or, you
know, getting marijuana or something like that.”  Tr. 33-34. Also, he did not enjoy the physical
affects of smoking marijuana and determined it was not in his best interests for employment. Tr. 47-
48, 53-54. He has never participated in or attended any form of drug treatment or counseling
program.  Tr. 37. 
4
The last time he smoked marijuana was in November 2006. This occurred after he began
work in January 2006 for his defense contractor employer, after he submitted his SF 86 in February
2006, and after he was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) in July 2006 where he stated he had no plans to use marijuana in the future. Tr. 39-44. He
knew marijuana use was a concern to the government when he began his employment. Tr. 46.
Regarding the future non-use of marijuana, he stated at his hearing:
I mean I can give you my word, and I guess aside from doing some sort or
rehabilitation program, that would kind of give some sort of credence to that, I could
do something of that nature.  I have no problem doing that. Tr. 55.
Applicant admitted purchasing marijuana during the period of June 2001 through June 2005, but
denied purchasing marijuana from June 2001 through November 2006 as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. The
government did not rebut Applicant’s statement. 
Applicant did not submit any character evidence or work-related performance
evaluations.
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider
the “Adjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information”
(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations
for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and
Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for access to
classified information.
These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline ¶ 2. An administrative
judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the
entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole person
concept,” an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the
person, past and 
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at Guideline ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being

considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”
Guideline ¶ 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing
controverted facts by “substantial evidence,”  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that4
it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to
classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying
condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.
The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship
that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because
of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and
confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions
under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,
risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any
express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.
Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above,
I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:

Drug Involvement
Guideline ¶ 24 articulates the Government’s concern concerning drug  involvement6
stating, “[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because
it raises questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and
regulations.”
Two Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “any drug abuse,”  and an “illegal7
drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,
or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.” Guideline ¶¶ 25(a) and
25(c).  The other six disqualifying conditions listed in Guideline ¶ 25 are not
applicable.
The two disqualifying conditions in Guideline ¶¶ 25(a) and 25(c) apply
because Applicant used, possessed, and purchased marijuana. 
The Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying
conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove
mitigation. Guideline ¶ 26 provides for potentially applicable criminal conduct
mitigating conditions: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;

(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any
violation;
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended;
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,
including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified
medical professional.
           Security concerns can be mitigated based on Guideline ¶ 26(a) by showing that
the drug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such
circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. There are no “bright line” rules for
determining when conduct is “recent.” The determination must be based “on a careful
evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.”  ISCR
Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows “a significant
period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,” then an administrative
judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates “changed circumstances
or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.” Id. Guideline ¶
26(a) does not fully apply because Applicant’s last marijuana use occurred as recently
as November 2006 and after he expressed an intent not to use drugs again during his July
2006 interview with an OPM Special Agent.  His overall drug abuse was varied and long8
lasting precluding the application of this mitigating condition. Based on all the facts and
circumstances, he has not met his burden of establishing that his drug use will not recur.
Guideline ¶ 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse
illegal drugs in the future. His use of marijuana in November 2006 after he signed his SF
86 in February 2006 and stating to an OPM Special Agent he had no plans to use
marijuana in the future in July 2006 precludes application of any of these mitigating
conditions.
          Applicant offered no evidence other than his statements at his hearing that he
intended to refrain from future drug use. He offered no corroborating evidence

suggesting he was drug free or was refraining from the use of drugs.  He has not9
described or demonstrated he has a source for support and guidance, or other positive
changes. He has not shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse.
Moreover, his failure to present readily available corroboration about his non-drug use
or life altering behavior from co-workers, neighbors, family and friends is another factor
in this decision weighing against mitigation of his drug involvement.  10
Personal Conduct
        Guideline ¶ articulates the Government’s concern concerning personal conduct
stating, “[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, . . . or unwillingness to comply with
rules regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified information.”
          One Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition that could raise a security concern
and may be disqualifying in this case, “personal conduct, . . .  or information about
one’s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal,
professional, or community standing . . . .”  Guideline ¶ 16(e).
          Applicant’s use of marijuana in November 2006 after he stated to an OPM Special
Agent he had no plans to use marijuana in the future gives rise to questionable judgment
and an unwillingness to follow rules.  Given this behavior on the heels of his OPM
interview precludes the application of any Mitigating Conditions under this Guideline.

“Whole Person” Analysis
      In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have
considered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole person concept under
Guideline ¶ 2(a). As noted above, Applicant’s history of drug abuse, and his actions
concerning illegal drug use were knowledgeable and voluntary. Although he is 24 years
old, he was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct, especially for his
drug use in November 2006. The likelihood of future drug abuse remains substantial
because insufficient time has elapsed since his last marijuana use, and Applicant has not
provided sufficient corroborative evidence of a change in his lifestyle. Nor does the
record contain evidence of a good employment record, or constructive community
involvement. Applicant’s use of drugs raises the possibility of compromise of sensitive
or classified information. Use of illegal drugs creates doubt about his judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness, and it calls into question his ability or willingness to
comply with laws, rules and regulations. Abuse of drugs is not prudent or responsible.
          Applicant presented little or no extenuating and mitigating evidence to counter the
information about his drug abuse. He offered little other than his assertions that he has
changed his behavior and desire to maintain drug-free status in the future. On the other
hand, he voluntarily and candidly disclosed his history of drug abuse on his February
2006 SF 86 and in his July 2006 OPM interview. Applicant provided the only record
evidence showing his drug abuse. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his
employer’s rules or requirements, and his sincerity about making future progress weigh
in his favor. 
       In sum, Applicant did not demonstrate that he will remain drug free. There is
insufficient evidence about improvement regarding his understanding of his situation.
He did not receive counseling or therapy, and he may not have a clear perception of, or
understanding about, how to avoid problematic situations or why he abused drugs. The
recency of his drug abuse, especially his marijuana use after applying for a security
clearance weighed most heavily against him. The evidence of his rehabilitative efforts
is insufficient to resolve my doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good
judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the
security concerns pertaining to drug involvement. The evidence leaves me with doubts
as to Applicant’s security eligibility and suitability.  
         I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”  and11
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative
Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has
not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he
is not eligible for access to classified information.
