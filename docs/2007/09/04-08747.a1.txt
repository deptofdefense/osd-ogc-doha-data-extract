APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 16, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis
There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge considered all the record evidence unless he specifically states1
otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).  Moreover, a Judge is not required to cite
or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992).   In this
case, the Judge specifically addressed favorable evidence cited by the Applicant.  See Decision at 2, 6 and 9.

for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.
On March 26, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied
Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse security
clearance decision under Guideline H is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
 
Applicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under
Guideline H had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant’s drug use occurred in the
past, Applicant has demonstrated that he would not use drugs in the future, and Applicant provided
clear evidence of rehabilitation.  In support of this argument, Applicant points to the favorable
evidence in the record, including his participation in counseling, his academic achievements, his
military service, his outstanding work record, and his significant community service.   Given the1
totality of the record evidence, Applicant’s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge’s decision
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.” Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.
Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  “The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn
simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their
application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.” See
ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  “Thus, the presence of some mitigating
evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.”  See
ISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  “As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the
evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,
or vice versa.  An applicant’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability
to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge
weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.”  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).
In this case, the Judge made sustainable findings as to a  lengthy and serious history of
improper or illegal drug use by an Applicant who was familiar with the security clearance process.
That history included illegal marijuana use, sometimes on a daily basis, from approximately 1998
to at least September 2003.  It also included the purchase of marijuana, three marijuana-related
criminal offenses, and the illegal use of marijuana while holding a security clearance granted by the
Department of Defense.  A review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating
evidence offered by Applicant against the record evidence relating to the length, seriousness and
recency of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating
3
conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the
Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government’s security
concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before him, the
Judge’s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines H is not arbitrary, capricious or
contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12548  at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006).
