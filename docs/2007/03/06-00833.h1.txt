SYNOPSIS
Applicant is 49 years old and works as a vice president for a defense contractor. He had
security clearances in the past. On two separate occasions, he deliberately falsified material facts
regarding his illegal drug use on his security clearance applications. He failed to accurately state the
amount of marijuana, cocaine, hallucucinogenics, and acid, he used during the previous 25 years.
In 2003, he was denied access to Sensitive Compartmented Information by another government
agency due to his illegal drug use while holding a security clearance and for providing discrepant
information regarding his use of drugs. Applicant has not mitigated the personal and criminal
conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On January 6, 2003, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
November 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons under
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an
Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or revoked.
In a written statement, dated November 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations and requested an in-person hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007.
A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 10, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 28, 2007.
The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the government offered six exhibits, Exs.
1-6, and Applicant offered one exhibit, Ex. A. All exhibits were accepted into the record without
objections. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 12, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant denied all the allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct and Guideline J,
criminal conduct. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 49 years old and was a self-employed entrepreneur from 1990 until his firm was
acquired by a federal defense contractor.  At the height of his flourishing technology business, he2
created more than 250 jobs.  He currently works as a vice president for a defense contractor.  In 19823 4
he received a master’s degree in industrial engineering  from a state university.  In January 1995, he5

received a Secret clearance.  He received a Top Secret clearance in January 2001. He was married6
in 1983 and has six children, aged 23 to 11.7
Applicant’s involvement with illegal substances has been extensive, spanning 25 years, when
he was between the ages of approximately 18 and 43.  During this period, he used marijuana,8
cocaine, hallucucinogenics, and acid. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during times
in his life when he had been entrusted with a government security clearance at both the Secret and
Top Secret levels.
When he executed his SF 86 on August 23, 2001, in response to question 27 (Your Use of
Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs  Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,
whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,
cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),amphetamines,
depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or
 prescription drugs?), he failed to disclose the following: (1) he used marijuana from 1994 to at least
August 2001, and (2) he used marijuana approximately once per week in 1994 and approximately
twice per week from 1995 to August 2001.
In a signed, sworn statement, dated September 25, 2001, to an authorized investigator of the
Department of Defense, he falsified material facts in that he stated that he had used marijuana very
occasionally over the previous 10 years. He indicated that he used marijuana most recently in about
2000 at a concert, he did not use any other illegal drugs, had not bought illegal drugs, and had no
plans to use illegal drugs in the future. In truth, he failed to indicate: (1) he used marijuana, with
varying frequency to include two times per week, to at least September 2001; (2) he purchased
marijuana; and (3) he used cocaine from 1992 to 1993. He also stated the following regarding his
use of marijuana:
I do not use any drugs, medical or illegal. I am a Christian man raising 6 children.
However, over the last 10 years I have been in the presence of, and very occasionally
puffed on marijuana.9
On January 6, 2003, he executed another SF 86, and in question 27 (the same question as that
in the 2001 SF 86) asking about his use of illegal drugs, he failed to disclose the following:  (1) he
used marijuana, approximately two times per week, from 1996 to at least September 2001, and (2)
he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, granted on March 10, 1995.

Applicant testified that he understated his use of drugs in both SF 86s.  When he was10
questioned as to whether he made false statements to the government, he testified:
Not intentionally false statements. That’s not the way it happened. I didn’t sit there
and lie or say oh, I think I’m going to lie to the Government. It – it – you lie to
yourself  in these matters. And then, through the course of this, almost like
counseling you end up kind of getting clear on everything. I did not intentionally lie.11
On October 11, 2001 and January 6, 2003,  Applicant was interviewed for a security12
clearance by a representative of NSA (National Security Agency) Associate Directorate for Security
and Counterintelligence. During the first interview, he elaborated on his drug use. At the 2003
interview, he revised the number of times he used marijuana. From 1995 to September 2001, he used
marijuana approximately twice per week. He purchased it on approximately 10 occasions during that
time period, paying no more than $40 per purchase. When confronted with his use of illegal drugs
while holding government clearances, Applicant stated “that he understood the policies prohibiting
involvement with illegal drugs, but he didn’t think the policies were ‘serious.’”
As a result of both his 2001 and 2003 interviews with NSA, in 2003, Applicant was denied
access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) due to his illegal drug use while holding a
security clearance and for providing discrepant information.  This decision was affirmed on April13
28, 2004.
At the hearing, Applicant stated the following about of use of illegal drugs during the past
25 years:
When you’re talking about personal drug use and you’re a father of six and you’re
running a company and you’re a leader in your community, these – types of things
to the Federal Government is shameful. It is embarrassing. And – and an intelligent
mind can concoct all kinds of reasons and rationale and all kinds of things to not
reveal this because of the shame and embarrassment.14
Applicant’s falsification of answers on his SF 86s, sworn statement, and interviews with
NSA, could all be considered criminal activity, which constitutes a violation of federal law, Title 18,
United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.

POLICIES
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating
a person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying
conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,
each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed
in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the
motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,
or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and
(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome
determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured
against this policy guidance.
The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government15
has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a16
preponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant17
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.18
Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance
decision.19
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard indicates that20
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Any reasonable21
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved
in favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security22
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication23
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have
established for issuing a clearance.

CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the
following conclusions.
Personal Conduct
Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the
person’s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified
information. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline
E, personal conduct.
On two separate occasions, in 2001 and 2003, Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and
material facts in his SF 86. In 2001 and 2003, he was interviewed by NSA. He finally divulged the real
extent of his drug use at the 2003 interview. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC
DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), E2.A5.1.2.3 (deliberately
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator,
security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a
personnel security or trustworthiness determination), E2.A5.1.2.4 (personal conduct or concealment
of information that increases an individual’s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such
as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, professional, or
community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and E2.A5.1.2.5 (a pattern of
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between
the individual and the agency) all apply here. None of the applicable Personal Conduct Mitigating
Conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the government’s case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a
through 1.e of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.
Criminal Conduct
Criminal Conduct is always a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity
creates doubt about a persons judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The government has
established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline J, criminal conduct.
The allegations under a criminal conduct security concern focus solely on the false statements
Applicant provided in his SF 86s signed in 2001 and 2003, and his signed, sworn statement in 2001.
Applicant’s involvement with illegal substances has been extensive, and it has spanned a period of 25
years, when he was between the ages of approximately 18 and 43. While in college, he purchased
marijuana, spending between $20 and $40 three times per year between 1977 and 1982. He last
purchased illegal drugs in 1989. On a less frequent basis, he used halluciongenic mushrooms, cocaine,
and acid. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during times in his life when he had been
entrusted with a government security clearance at both the Secret and Top Secret levels. He repeatedly
lied to the government about his drug use. Although he testified he stopped using drugs in September
2001, there is no evidence to support his contention. Moreover, because he lied so much about his past
drug use, I did not find him credible. Even, arguendo, that he stopped using illegal drugs in 2001, I
do not think that lying in three documents to the government to process his security clearance, warrants
8
a clearance because he has been drug-free for five years. This is not a case of being rehabilitated from
drug use. This case involves Applicant lying to the government about his past drug use. It was not until
interviews with NSA in 2003 that he found courage to tell the truth about 25 years of illegal drug use.
I commend his five years of being drug-free. However, his lying caused him to lose his access to SCI
in October 2003 and that decision was affirmed on April 28, 2004. Thus, I cannot conclude that
Applicant is willing to tell the truth, without prompting. Consequently, Criminal Conduct
Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct,
regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single serious
crime or multiple lesser offenses) apply.
Various factors can mitigate the criminal conduct security concern. Applicant has failed to
truthfully convey the extent of his drug use to the government while his applications were being
processed for a security clearance. Applicant’s use of illegal drugs spanned almost 25 years, and
included the illegal use of marijuana, halluciongenic mushrooms, cocaine, and acid. The record is
devoid of Applicant being involved in any recent use of illegal drugs. However, not only has Applicant
failed to disclose the extent of his illegal drug use and the period of time he used drugs, he provided
contradictory information in his two SF 86s and his sworn statement. It was not until June 2003, that
he provided a complete picture of his drugs use to an agent of another government agency. As a result
of the information provided in his June 2003 interview, he was denied access to SCI. Moreover, that
decision was sustained on appeal. Thus, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC)
E2.A10.1.3.1 (the criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (the crime was an isolated
incident), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and
those pressures are not longer present in that person’s life),CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 (the person did not
voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), and CC
MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) do not apply. Applicant has not
mitigated the government’s case. Accordingly, allegation 2.a of the SOR is concluded against
Applicant.
I have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the “whole person”
concept in evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. At age 49,
he is highly educated and has been an entrepreneur in business, having run his own company for 15
years. Moreover, as a businessman, he was astute enough to sell his business to a company that is well-
known in the federal contracting business. However savvy he might be in business, Applicant is naive
about how his lying about his illegal use of drugs, which could negatively impact on his future career
endeavors. The allegations under criminal conduct focus solely on the false statements he provided in
two SF 86s and his signed, sworn statement. Much of his illegal drug involvement took place during
times in his life when he had been entrusted with a government security clearance at both the Top
Secret and Secret levels. This is not a case of being rehabilitated from drug use. This case involves
Applicant lying to the government about his past drug-use. It was not until interviews with NSA that
he found courage to tell the truth about 25 years of illegal drug use. Moreover, he lost access to SCI
based on lying and discrepancies found in his many statements. Based on the evidence of record,
however, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.
For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.
