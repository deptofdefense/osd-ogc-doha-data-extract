APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
Nichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
D. Christopher Russell, Esq.
“The Law of Return made after the reestablishment of the state of Israel allowed any Jew to come to Israel and1
receive automatic citizenship . . . I was naturalized as an Israeli citizen in 1976 when I went to Israel to study in the
University of Tel Aviv.  If I were offered a U.S. government job requiring a security clearance prior to being naturalized,
I probably would not have become a naturalized Israeli citizen.”  Government Exhibit 2, Interrogatory Response, April
28, 2006.
This letter is addressed to the U.S. Department of Defense and states, “I hereby notify the Department of2
Defense that I am going to renounce my Israeli citizenship.”  AE D.  At the hearing, Applicant testified “I mentioned at
least two, maybe three times that I would be willing to give up my Israeli citizenship, renounce it . . . I’d like to keep it
for cultural and religious reasons, but I will give it up because it is not conducive with this work environment . . . And
I will do it.  I – I’ve got no remorse.  I will do it.”  Tr. at 34.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On December 16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On May 7, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch
denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed properly to consider
and weigh the record evidence and whether her adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.
Applicant was born in the United States but moved with his family to Europe when he was
13 years old.  Graduating from high school in 1970, he moved to Israel in 1975 to attend college,
following an enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.  While there “he was conscripted into the Israeli army
from 1977 until May 1978.”  Decision at 2.  Applicant acquired Israeli citizenship by virtue of “the
Israeli Law of Return.”   Id. at 3.  He has maintained dual citizenship from the mid 1970s forward,1
although on March 11, 2007, he signed a letter “renouncing his Israeli citizenship.”   Id.2
Additionally, he surrendered his Israeli passport by mailing it to the Israeli Embassy on the day of
the hearing.
After his service in the Israeli military, Applicant returned to the U.S., joining the U.S. Army
for a 20-year career.  In November 2002, he returned to Israel for what he characterized as a
“vacation” or “sightseeing time,” traveling with a “one-year temporary” Israeli passport.  Id.  In 2003
he voted in an Israeli parliamentary election.  
A Judge is required to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation
for” the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.’”
Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43
(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  “The
general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests
of national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal
Board may reverse the Judge’s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  ¶¶  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.
Directive¶ E2.10(a)(7). 3

“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.”  Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any
appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  ¶  E3.1.15.  “The application of disqualifying and
mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more
of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of
sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.”  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).
Applicant contends that the Judge did not consider certain pieces of record evidence,
including the relative extent of Applicant’s ties with Israel and the United States, his character
references, his service in the U.S. military and honorable discharge therefrom, and other similar
matters.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence, and there is nothing to
indicate that she did otherwise in this particular case.  See ISCR Case No. 05-14488 at 4 (App. Bd.
Aug. 10, 2007).  See also ISCR Case No. 02-29373 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 2005).
Applicant contends that the Judge erred as to the length of time he spent in the Israeli
military, asserting that it was only 5 ½ to 6 months rather than the arguably longer time contained
in the findings of fact.  Assuming without deciding that the Judge’s finding is error, we conclude that
it would not have changed the outcome of the case.   See ISCR 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5,
2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 at 5 (App.
Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Therefore, it is harmless.    
Applicant argues that the Department Counsel did not present substantial evidence on the
question of whether Applicant’s having voted in the Israeli election was contrary to the interests of
the United States, with the result that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion to
Applicant.  This argument is without merit.  The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational
connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s security
eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28935 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-
31188 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2005).  One potential Guideline C disqualifying condition (DC) is
“voting in a foreign election.”   SOR paragraph 1(c) alleges that Applicant “voted in the 2003 Israeli3
elections, while residing in Israel from November 2002 until March 2003.”  Neither the Adjudicative
Guidelines nor the SOR make conflict with U.S. interests an element of this DC which Department
Counsel must affirmatively prove by substantial evidence before the burden of persuasion shifts to
Applicant.  In any event, Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR, relieving
Department Counsel of her obligation to produce evidence concerning it.  This admission is enough
to shift the burden of persuasion to Applicant. Therefore, there is no error in the Judge’s treatment
of the parties’ burdens in this case.  
Applicant points to some cases by Hearing Office Judges which he contends support granting
him a clearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  However, such decisions are
binding neither on Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 03-26115 at 3 (App.
Bd. Apr. 5, 2007).

We have evaluated the Judge’s decision in light of the record as a whole.  She considered
both the fact that Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport and that he expressed an intent to
renounce Israeli citizenship.  However, she concluded that such relatively belated actions, having
taken place close to or on the day of the hearing, were not sufficient to outweigh “his long term
attachment to Israel,” and his “recent outreach” to that country.  This outreach was evidenced by his
having moved back there in 2002 with an Israeli passport and having voted in an Israeli election.
While Applicant may disagree with the weight which the Judge assigned to the evidence, “an ability
to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence . . .  is not sufficient to demonstrate that the
Judge . . . reached conclusions that are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.”  ISCR Case No. 06-
17714 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).
