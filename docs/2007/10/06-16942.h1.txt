Pro Se
SYNOPSIS
Applicant is 37 years old, married, with three children from her two marriages.  She works
for a defense contractor in the health insurance business.  She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001
to discharge about $22,000 in delinquent debts.  Now she owes about $33,000 in delinquent debts.
She repaid some debts, has an installment payment plan for another 28 debts, and has seven debts
unpaid, though she and her husband have the savings to repay them over the next year.  Applicant
did not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concern.  Her eligibility for a
trustworthiness determination is denied.
Adjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD1
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).
Pursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended2
and modified, and the Directive.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
position of trustworthiness for Applicant .  On August 25, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of1
Reasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision–trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline2
F (Financial Considerations) the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.  Applicant answered the
SOR in writing on November 27, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.
The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 28, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness
determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were
admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2007.  Applicant
corrected the spelling of her name on her Answer, and I used that spelling in the caption of this
decision. 
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 37 years old, married with three children, and works for a defense contractor in
the health insurance industry.  Since February 2005, she has worked as an image clerk.  She has a
second job cleaning various parts of a local hospital.  She works from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. five days a
week, and part-time on Sundays, at these two jobs.  She has diabetes and high blood pressure.  She
was married to her first husband from 1993 to 1995, which marriage produced her two oldest
children.  She married her second husband in November 2004, and has one child from that marriage.
(Tr. 33, 35, 36, 45, 46, 70, 71; Exhibit 1)
While a single parent from 1995 to 2004, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August
14, 2001.  She listed debts totaling $22,110.42 that were discharged in bankruptcy on November 22,
2001.  Currently, she has 43 delinquent debts totaling $33,302.61 listed in the SOR.  She and her
current husband earn a net joint monthly income of $4,500.  After paying their bills, including rent,
auto purchase payment, insurance, food, child expenses (day care is provided by Applicant’s mother
who lives with her), and other monthly expenses, Applicant and her husband have about $1,292 per
month of discretionary income.  From that amount her husband sends $200 to his mother in Mexico.
Applicant also spends about $200 monthly on weekly family entertainment excursions for pizza and
movies.  Their remaining  net monthly discretionary income is $892.  This money Applicant’s
husband sends to a savings account in Mexico.  He now has $4,000 in that account.  They do not
have a savings account in a U.S. bank.  The money sent also pays for medical care for Applicant’s
3
father who recently had a stroke.  Applicant’s husband is an illegal alien in the United States.
Applicant claims he overstayed his visa in error.  Applicant paid an attorney $5,000, plus another
$1,200 before this hearing, to represent her husband in an attempt to improve his immigration status
to avoid deportation.  Applicant also retained an attorney in an attempt to terminate her former
husband’s visitation and custody rights because he does not pay child support, or have contact with
his two children.  Applicant did not state what fee she pays that attorney.  Applicant’s husband has
four credit cards which he pays in full each month. (Tr. 33-41, 47-54, 60-63; Exhibits 1-3)
Of her 43 delinquent debts, Applicant repaid eight of them.  In February 2006, she paid, the
$124 for an overdrawn check (1.i).  She paid the judgment obtained against her by a former landlord
in July 2004, by garnishment from her paycheck.  That repayment was completed in July 2007 (1.j).
She paid in March 2006, four speeding tickets unpaid since 2005, totaling $432 (1.aa, 1.cc, 1.dd,
1.ee).  Finally, she repaid her higher education loans totaling $1,446 in April 2007 (1.o, 1.p). (Tr. 21,
32, 57, 58; Exhibits 2, 3, A, D-G; Answer)
Applicant has an installment payment plan under her state’s law.  She paid an attorney $800
and paid the trustee $2,500 under the plan (which is not bankruptcy under Federal law) to administer
the plan for at least the next two and a half years.  Applicant pays the trustee $603 each month to be
divided among four creditors under the plan, who are owed 28 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.
Since March 2007, Applicant has made those payments.  The first debt in the plan is $10,183 to a
bank for the balance of a loan on a repossessed automobile (1.nn).  The second debt is to a telephone
service provider for three debts totaling $1,767 (1.f, 1.g, 1.bb).  The third debt is to a pay day loan
company for three loans totaling $2,364.40 (1.l, 1.m., 1.n).  The fourth group of debts is owed to a
hospital for medical services provided when Applicant did not have medical insurance and suffered
two miscarriages in 2004.  Those debts total $12,615.41 (1.d, 1.k, 1.q to 1.y, 1.gg to 1.qq). (Tr. 13-
17, 23-27, 45; Exhibits 1-3, B, C, E)
Applicant has not paid seven delinquent debts totaling $2,751, and are as follows: (1) $565
to a collector (1.b); (2) a dental bill for $200 (1.c); (3) a credit card debt of $425 (1.e) on a card
which Applicant no longer has (Applicant does not have any credit cards presently); (4) a car
insurance debt of $170 (1.h); (5) a utility bill of $303 (1.z); (6) a pay day loan for $600 (1.ff); and,
(7) $488 to a collector for a check cashing company (1.rr).  Applicant has not discussed paying these
debts with her husband, in part because,“We have to make payments on stuff.”  Applicant is not
paying these debts until she repays the debts under the installment repayment plan managed by the
trustee.  She did not include these debts in that plan because her monthly payments would rise to
$900 and be more than she can afford. (Tr. 30, 31, 42, 43, 45; Exhibits 2, 3, E)
POLICIES
As Commander in Chief, the President has “the authority to . . . control access to information
bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to
occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his
designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that
it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information with Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for
4
Counterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense
Security Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination
shall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is
predicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive ¶ 2.3.  An applicant “has the
ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue his trustworthiness determination.” See Directive ¶ E3.1.15
The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive
sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating
conditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall
common sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a
position of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.
10865 § 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.
In evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess
the adjudicative process factors listed in ¶ 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the
nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and
the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood
of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case
presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust
the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although
adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or
recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the
Guidelines.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being
eligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection
between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an
applicant’s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).
All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for
mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR
Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has
established a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  An applicant “has the ultimate
burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his
trustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  “Any doubt as to
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved
in favor of the national security.” Directive ¶ E2.2.2
5
Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative
guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:
Guideline F:Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1
“The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all
available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .
assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.”
(Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as
the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.
DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.
(Regulation ¶ C8.2.1)
CONCLUSIONS
Financial Considerations:  Applicant has a history of spending beyond her means and lacks
ability to repay the debts.  The 2001 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharged $22,110.42 in debts .  She
accumulated those debts between 1995 and 2001.  That is a large sum of delinquent debts for anyone
to accumulate. 
After her bankruptcy discharge, Applicant proceeded to accumulate another $33,302.61 in
delinquent debt.  She obviously has a difficult time managing money.  She has taken no courses or
credit counseling to learn how to live within her income at age 37.  She married again in 2004 to a
man whose immigration status now makes him illegal.  Between the two of them, they earn $4,500
per month, for a total of $56,000 annually.  That income should be sufficient for them to live
comfortably and pay their debts.  Her husband sends their monthly net income s to Mexico to be used
for his family.  The $4,000 saved in the Mexican savings account would pay Applicant’s remaining
seven delinquent debts of $2,751. 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations
E2.A6.1.2.1), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  Since 2001,
Applicant accumulated substantial debt that she cannot repay.  Her payment priorities over the years
demonstrate amply her inability to manager money and pay her debts in a reasonable time period.
Applicant repaid some debts, and to establish under her state’s law an installment payment
plan protected by that state law.  About $12,000 of Applicant’s debt arose from medical care
obtained when Applicant had no medical insurance.  She had two miscarriages in 2004.  Those
expenses are mitigated by those medical emergencies and her present plan to repay them as they
represent factors beyond her control.  Two Mitigating Conditions (MC) may apply in this case.  MC
3 (Conditions resulting in the behavior were beyond Applicant’s control because of unemployment
and divorce E2.A6.1.3.3), and MC 6 (Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts E2.A6.1.3.6) are the two MC which might apply. 
6
However, Applicant’s history of debt accumulation, being approximately $55,000 in the past
12 years, shows a significant inability to control her spending.  It also shows she accumulates debt
much faster than she could ever hope to repay it in a reasonable time or by a reasonable plan.  
Whole Person Analysis
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a" trustworthiness decision. Directive
E2.2.1.  “Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.” Id.  In evaluating Applicant’s case,
I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive ¶ E2.2.1.
Applicant’s conduct on debt accumulation and repayment is one of spending more than she
earns, and not being able to repay it within a reasonable time.  She has engaged in this course of
conduct over a 12-year period.  The repeated nature of her conduct is serious and shows a lack of
control and good judgment.  She is mature and should know that such conduct will result in financial
difficulties. 
The debts listed in the SOR include pay day loans with high interest rates, telephone bills,
a utility bill, unpaid rent, and other debts which she could have avoided with a little forethought and
planning.  However, based on her long history of fiscal irresponsibility and an outstanding balance
of about $27,000, I am not certain that her problems are under control and will not recur.  She needs
a record of debt repayment performance to persuade me otherwise.
Therefore, after considering all of the evidence and applying all of the DC and MC, and then
evaluating the “whole person” that Applicant presented at the hearing, I conclude the financial
considerations trustworthiness determination against Applicant.  I also conclude the “whole person
concept” against Applicant based on her entire history of debt accumulation, demonstrated inability
to repay these debts in a timely and reasonable process, and sizeable amount of debt currently
remaining to be paid.  Applicant’s spending priorities contribute to her financial delinquencies, and
she has not obtained any professional credit or debt counseling to educate herself so she can avoid
the problem in the future.
FORMAL FINDINGS
The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:
Paragraph 1.  Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a to 1.rr: Against Applicant
DECISION
7
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.
Her application for a trustworthiness determination is denied.
