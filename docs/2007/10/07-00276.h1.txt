SYNOPSIS
Applicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. He has done nothing to demonstrate
that he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance is denied. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
 Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,1
1992, as amended (Directive).
 See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:2
Implementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December
29, 2005). 
 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.7. 3
2
This is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny
or revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD
Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons1
(SOR) to Applicant on April 27, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and
it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial
considerations based on delinquent debts.  
In addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by
the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense
Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in
Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR
has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Revised Guidelines apply here because2
the SOR is dated after the effective date.  
Applicant replied to the SOR with an incomplete response dated May 12, 2007. Upon
request, he submitted an undated second response received by DOHA on June 22, 2007. He elected
to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.
On July 16, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and
material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on July 25, 2007. Applicant did not
reply within the 30-day period after receipt of the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on3
September 26, 2007.   
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant is a 54-year-old mobile-equipment operator for a company engaged in defense
contracting. He has worked for his current employer since 1977. In addition to this employment, he
has worked a part-time job as a cleaner for a real estate firm since 1998.  
Applicant has been married to the same woman since 1977. He has three children, born in
1978, 1981, and 1983, all of whom are adults. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts ranging
from $31 to $7,075 for a total of about $16,103. He admits the indebtedness except for a $1,509
charged-off account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. The 14 delinquent debts are established by credit reports
from 2005 and 2007 (Exhibits 8 and 9). None of the accounts have been paid.

security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (“It is likewise plain that thereth
is no ‘right’ to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane’s.”).

Applicant claims that the $1,509 charged-off account was paid in April 1999 (Exhibit 7). He
submitted paperwork to support his claim, but this paperwork appears to be for another debt and is
not connected to the $1,509 charged-off account. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES
No one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department4
of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an5
applicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret
information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security6
clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing
security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether7
an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of
protecting national security.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access
to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts8
alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence9
to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an10
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,11
the Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The12
agency appellate authority has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are
reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13
The Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.14
 Revised Guidelines at 13–14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 15
 Revised Guidelines at 13. 16
 DC 1 is “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” 17
 DC 3 is “a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 18

conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial
commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access
to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government
must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access
to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination
of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict14
guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.
CONCLUSIONS
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to15
significant unpaid debts. “Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”  Similarly, an individual who is16
financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly
handling and safeguarding classified information.   
The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.
His history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline17 18
F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. 
All of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in
Applicant’s favor. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, and other than his limited response to
interrogatories, he did not provide sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern raised by the
government’s evidence. Indeed, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic approach for resolving his
delinquent debts; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a measurable
improvement to his situation. At this point, it is likely that his history of financial problems will
continue. 
To conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. He has a history of unresolved financial problems, and
he has done nothing to demonstrate that he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory
manner. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance
5
decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that
analysis does not support a favorable decision. 
FORMAL FINDINGS
SOR ¶ 1–Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs a–n: Against Applicant
DECISION
In light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
