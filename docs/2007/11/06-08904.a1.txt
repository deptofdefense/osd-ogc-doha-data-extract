KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: Applicant disputes a debt of $1,885 but has made no effort contact the creditor.  He has
made no effort to pay a debt $8,784 because it is old, unenforceable and not on his credit report. 
The Judge concluded that Applicant’s handling of his finances casts considerable doubt on
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a clearance.  The
Judge’s conclusion is sustainable.  Adverse decision affirmed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
2
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On November 27, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant
of the basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On July 17, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.
Matchinski denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal
pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge’s factual
findings were based upon substantial evidence; whether the Judge erred in concluding that
Department Counsel had met its burden of production; and whether the Judge erred in her
application of the appropriate mitigating conditions.  We further construe Applicant’s brief as
asserting that the Judge’s whole person analysis is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and that
the Judge was biased against Applicant.  Finding no error, we affirm. 
The Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working for a
defense contractor.  He previously worked for a government agency, holding a top secret clearance.
His current salary is $120,000, and his wife earns $36,572.75.  He and his wife have a joint savings
account with a balance of $314,172.12.  His retirement assets are $14,652 and he participates in a
savings and investment plan through his employer, the current value of his account being about
$100,000.   Applicant has two debts on the SOR, one for $1,885 and another for $8,784.  These debts
have been charged off.  Although Applicant has disputed the first debt, he has made no effort to
contact the creditor to determine if it is legitimate or not.  He has not made any effort to pay off the
larger debt, because it is now old, legally unenforceable and no longer maintained on his credit
report. 
The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion in denying
the legitimacy of the smaller of the two alleged debts.  The Judge noted that, in an interrogatory
response, Applicant did not deny the debt but claimed that it was not enforceable.  She stated that
Applicant had provided no corroboration for his contention that the debt was not his own.  She
concluded that Applicant’s failure to address these debts while possessing the means to do so
impugns his trustworthiness and reliability:  “. . . Applicant’s handling of his financial matters casts
considerable doubt as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a
security clearance.”  Decision at 8.
We have considered Applicant’s assignments of error.  We conclude that the Judge’s material
findings of security concern are sustainable.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.  There is no record evidence
that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question her fairness.  See
ISCR Case No. 04-12911 at 2 (App. Bd. July 25, 2006).  We have considered the Judge’s application
both of the disqualifying conditions and mitigating factors as well as her whole-person analysis.  We
conclude that she has drawn a rational connection between her factual findings and her ultimate
adverse clearance decision.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371
U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Therefore, we hold that her decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor
contrary to law.  See Directive ¶¶ E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.
