APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Alan V. Edmunds, Esq.
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On April 4, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis
for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
The Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E and with respect to SOR paragraphs 1.b through 1.j,1
and 1.l and 1.m.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal.

Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 13, 2007, after the hearing,
Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.
Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse security
clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1
Applicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under
Guideline F had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant has received counseling for
his financial problems, he initiated a good faith effort to resolve those problems, and there are clear
indications that his problems are under control.  In support of his argument, he cites to several
DOHA Hearing Office decisions in which applicants in ostensibly similar circumstances were
granted clearances.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant’s arguments do not
demonstrate that the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
The Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has
submitted in his appeal brief.  However, such decisions are binding neither on Hearing Office Judges
nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 05-14853 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2007).
“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.” Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.
Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise
of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole. See ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7
(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  “Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel
the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.”  See ISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd.
Mar. 19, 2007).  “As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide
whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant’s
disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different
interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or
reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.”  See ISCR Case No.
05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).
A review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered
by Applicant against the record evidence relating to the length, seriousness and recency of the
disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and
whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to most of the factual
allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had
presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government’s security concerns.  The
Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge’s ultimate
unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See,
e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-06913  at 2-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2007).
