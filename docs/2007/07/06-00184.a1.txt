APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On June 22, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2007, after the hearing,
2
Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that
the security concerns raised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated.
Applicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under
Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated, in that he gave insufficient weight to Applicant’s
explanations at the hearing and the fact that Applicant had served honorably in the military for over
24 years.  In support of his argument, Applicant offers new evidence which documents his
continuing efforts to resolve his financial problems.  Applicant’s argument does not demonstrate that
the Judge erred.
The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Accordingly,
we may not consider Applicant’s additional documentary evidence, and its submission does not
demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.
There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless
he specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).
The Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case
No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 1992).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant
actually mishandles or fails to properly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke
access to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert.
denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage
in conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd.
Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and
circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis
to determine an applicant's security clearance eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined
to the workplace. See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).
“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.” Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.
Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person
factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a
case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record
evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the
presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the
favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant’s disagreement
with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the
evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in
a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
The Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding
that the Guideline F and E allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly
3
disagrees with the Judge’s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.32.3.
In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the
length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  He reasonably explained why the evidence
which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government’s
security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited
by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was
before him, the Judge’s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines F and E
is sustainable.
Order
The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
