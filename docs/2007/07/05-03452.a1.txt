APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On August 11, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 16, 2007, after the hearing,
Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that
the security concerns raised under Guidelines G and J had not been mitigated.
Applicant contends that the Judge’s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge
did not give sufficient weight to Applicant’s mitigating evidence which showed that Applicant has
held a security clearance without incident for approximately 17 years, and that four of the criminal
charges against him had been dismissed or had resulted in a finding of not guilty.  In support of this
contention, Applicant restates the evidence he presented below, and offers new evidence in the form
of an additional explanation about the four criminal charges.  The Board does not find Applicant’s
contention persuasive. 
The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Its
submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799
at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).  Therefore, the Board may not consider Applicant’s additional
explanations.
The Board’s review of a Judge’s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by
substantial evidence—such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1.
“This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two
inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding from
being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,
(1966).
 
The Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to two of the charges to which he refers,
both of which were alleged under Guideline J.  Therefore, those findings are not at issue on appeal.
The other two charges were alcohol-related, so they were considered by the Judge in the context of
the Guideline G.  A Judge can find an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal
charges against the applicant were dropped or dismissed.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at 3 (App.
Bd. July 19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  The ultimate state
court dispositions of Applicant’s criminal incidents did not preclude the Judge from finding that
those incidents were alcohol-related.  See ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2004).
Considering the record as a whole, the Judge’s material findings with respect to Applicant’s alcohol-
related conduct reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and are supported by
substantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21933 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2006).
The absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance
decision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to
properly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See
Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An
applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security
implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000). The Directive's
Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of
security concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine an applicant's
3
security eligibility.  A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.
03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004). 
“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.” Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.
Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person
factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a
case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some
mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.
As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable
evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant’s disagreement with the
Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,
is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner
that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd.
Jan. 30, 2004). 
In this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of excessive
alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.   The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by
Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible
application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor
of Applicant with respect to some of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained
why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all
of the government’s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable
record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge’s
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
