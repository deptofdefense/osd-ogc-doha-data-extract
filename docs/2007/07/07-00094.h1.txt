STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On January 26, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
February 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to him,  pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information2
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),
dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  3
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence). The SOR
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer notarized on March 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and
elected to have his case decided at a hearing.  On April 5, 2007, the case was assigned to me. His4
hearing was held on May 16, 2007. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.
PROCEDURAL RULINGS
Administrative Notice
Department Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibit (Ex.)
2 through 8. Tr. 9-11. Department Counsel also provided a supporting document (Ex.
1) to show the basis for the facts in Exs. 2 through 8. Applicant did not object to my
taking administrative notice. Tr. 11. 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,
2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.

Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative
notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from
government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006)
(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice of
various facts derived from Exs. 2 through 8 as indicated under subheading “People’s
Republic of China” of this decision.
FINDINGS OF FACT 
As to the SOR’s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR
except ¶ 1.b.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a5
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings
of fact.  
Applicant is 53 years old.  He received a bachelor of science degree majoring in6
information systems and a Ph.D in philosophy from a Chinese university. He was
awarded a second Ph.D in ancient philosophy from a U.S. university in August 1994. He
has no prior U.S. military service. He has never been married. He does not currently
hold a security clearance. He has never been fired from a job, and he began his current
employment with a government contractor as a software application engineer in
November 2004. There is no derogatory information concerning his police or financial
records. He has never used illegal drugs.
Applicant was born in China in 1954, and he moved to the United States in 1989.
He became a U.S. citizen in January 2001. He was issued a U.S. passport in February
2003. 
Applicant’s mother is approximately 81 years old, and she is a citizen resident
of China. During her working life, she was a member of the Communist party and was
employed by the Chinese opera as “kind of in charge of some parts of the opera.”  Tr.
25.  Applicant’s father is approximately 91 years old, and he is a citizen resident of
China. During his working life, he was the deputy secretary of the communist party at
a Chinese university where he was employed.  Tr. 24-25.  Both of his parents have been
retired “before 1988, about 18 years ago.”  Answer to SOR.
Applicant communicates with his parents by telephone approximately two or three
times a year, usually around a Chinese holiday.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 25.  His parents
have never visited the U.S.  
T h e  c o n te n ts  o f  th e  P R C  se c t io n  a re  f ro m  E x s .  2  th ro u g h  8 .

Applicant has two brothers, who are citizen residents of China.  His older brother
is employed as a mathematician and his younger brother owns a workout shop, “kind of
gym.”  Tr. 26.  Neither brother is a member of the Communist party.  
Applicant communicates with his older brother by telephone “about twice a year”
and communicates with his younger brother by telephone “about 7 or 8 times a year.”
Answer to SOR, Tr. 26-27.
Applicant has a Chinese-born sister who came to the U.S “in 1987 or 1988" and
later became a U.S. citizen.  Answer to SOR,  Tr. 28.  She is currently married to a U.S.
citizen, and has a former husband she left behind in China.  She and her first husband
have an adult daughter and that daughter is attending a U.S. university.  His sister has
a medical degree, which she earned in China, but has never practiced medicine.  His
sister is not currently working.  Applicant reports that he saw his sister one time in 1995
“for a few days” and communicates with her by telephone “only briefly and at most once
a year.”  Answer to SOR, Tr. 30-32. She goes back and forth to the PRC for lengthy
visits and at hearing date was currently visiting the PRC.  Tr. 32-33.  She is not a
member of the Communist party.
In 2005, Applicant visited the PRC for approximately two weeks and stayed with
his younger brother.  He reported his visit consisted of visiting his parents and brothers,
sight seeing, and shopping.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 27.
Applicant did not provide any character or reference statements nor did he call
any witnesses on his behalf.  
People’s Republic of China  7
China has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human
rights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention,
forced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment.
China is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and has
a population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an economy
that in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively competes with
the United States in many areas. China’s competitive relationship with the United States
exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant’s Chinese connections.  
China actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information
about the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a
global superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific
Rim and Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China
desires for economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of Americans
of Chinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China’s active intelligence gathering
programs focus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies.

POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge
must consider the “Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to
Classified Information” (Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for
each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline ¶ 2. An administrative judge’s over-
arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the
entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole
person concept,” an administrative judge considers all available, reliable information
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
Guideline ¶ 2(c).
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative
process factors listed at Guideline ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)
the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the
final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of national security.” Guideline ¶ 2(b). In reaching this decision, I
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded
on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial
evidence.”  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish8
a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly
“ T h e  A d m in is t r a t iv e  J u d g e  [ c o n s id e r s ]  th e  r e c o r d  e v id e n c e  a s  a  w h o le ,  b o th  fa v o r a b l e  a n d

consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to
classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a
disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present “witnesses and other
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven
by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to
obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving
a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at
5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by
necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail
a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,
risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or
patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Guideline ¶ 6 explains the Government’s concern about “foreign contacts and
interests” stating, “if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,
[he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,
or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or
coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial
interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the
foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information
and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.”
7
Guideline ¶ 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and
may be disqualifying in this case, including:
(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a
foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that
create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation
to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual’s desire
to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;
The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is
not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative
lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor
alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially
result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5
(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant
has infrequent contact with his parents and older brother.  He has more frequent
contact with his younger brother and maintains a relatively close relationship with
him. These contacts whether out of affection or obligation with his immediate family
members create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. His
relationship with these immediate family members also creates a potential conflict of
interest because it is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to
help his parents and brothers by providing sensitive or classified information. 
The Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying
conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a
mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating
condition never shifts to the Government.
Three Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline ¶ 8 are
potentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions:
(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in
which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the
U.S.;
(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense
of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or
country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;

8
(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for
foreign influence or exploitation;
Guideline ¶ 8(a) does not apply to his relationships with his parents and
brothers. His contacts with these immediate family members are not casual and
infrequent. If he does not contact these family members out of affection, he certainly
does so understandably out of obligation. Applicant could be placed in a position of
having to choose between his parents and brothers and the interests of the United
States.
Guideline ¶ 8(b) does not apply because Appellant has not demonstrated in the
evidence he presented a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S. that he can be
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Although he
lived in the United States since 1989, and became a U.S. citizen in 2001, he has not
demonstrated that he has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the
U.S. such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the
U.S. interest. The only immediate family member he has in the U.S. is a sister with
whom he has minimal contact. The facts presented by Applicant are insufficient to
overcome the security concerns as discussed in the “whole person” analysis, infra.  
Guideline ¶ 8(c) does not apply because of the regularity and consistency of his
contact with immediate family members in China.  
“Whole Person” Analysis 
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as
discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to
the whole person concept under Directive ¶ E2.2.1. “Under the whole person concept,
the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant’s life
separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant’s
security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and
circumstances.”  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are10
used for “whole person” analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve
misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the
eighth APF, “the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,” Directive ¶
E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the11
9
eighth APF, other “[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”
Directive ¶ E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is “an overall common sense
determination.”  Directive ¶ E2.2.3.    
The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address “evidence of an
applicant’s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant’s family’s ties to the
U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the
U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.” ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at
7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  
Substantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant’s security
clearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 18 years, and he has been a
naturalized citizen for four years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance
to the United States. His sister is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. There is no evidence
he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States.
Applicant does appear to take his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has
worked diligently for a defense contractor for almost three years.  
Five circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First,
China is a nuclear power and China’s government is a rival of the United States. China
is an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for security purposes, China
actively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. China may attempt to use
his parents and brothers who live in China to obtain such information. Second, he had
significant connections to China before he emigrated to the United States in 1989. He
was born in China, and spent his formative years there. Third, his parents and two
brothers are citizen residents of China and his parents were members of the Communist
party. Although his contacts with his parents and older brother are minimal, he still
maintains a sense of loyalty and obligation to them which continues. Fourth, he has
frequent and non-casual contact with his younger brother as evidenced by his
maintaining telephone contact with him seven to eight times per year. He visited China
one time in 2005 for two weeks to visit his family since he arrived in the U.S.
Individually, these contacts may appear minimal, but collectively they demonstrate a
sense of obligation and a connection with family members in China. Fifth, he has no
known ties with family members or persons with whom he maintains a close relationship
with in the U.S.  
Applicant has demonstrated that his younger sister is a U.S. citizen and not a citizen resident
of the PRC.  She does, however, maintain a close connection with China as evidenced by her
frequent return visits. 
“Because of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong
presumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it
is deemed best to err on the side of the government’s compelling interest in security by

security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. This is a close case, but ultimately the
evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant’s security eligibility and suitability.  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”  and12
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative
Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has
not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he
is not eligible for access to classified information.
