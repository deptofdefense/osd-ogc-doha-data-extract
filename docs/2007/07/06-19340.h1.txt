SYNOPSIS
       This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive1
5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.   
       Applicant did receive a copy of the DoD Directive 5220.6 which was sent with his Statement of Reasons2
(SOR).
       Exhibit 6, a bankruptcy petition and history, including a 1993 Discharge Order, was admitted over his3
objection.  He explained he thought he was taking a legal avenue in filing bankruptcy.  As Applicant had
admitted this allegation, I overruled his objection and admitted Exhibit 6 into evidence.  (Exhibit 6; TR 16-
17) He did not object to Exhibit 7, also records from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court from his 2000 filing.

Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his continuing and ongoing financial
problems, including a repossession of his car because of gambling debts.  While he consulted two
resources to help him develop a plan to resolve his problems, he provided no evidence that he has
paid any of his outstanding debts other than an IRS lien being paid through wage garnishments.
While he has taken some steps to reform his conduct and stated an intent to resolve his debts, he
failed to demonstrate sufficient positive changes in behavior.  Consequently, security concerns
remain over finances.  Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
to the Applicant on December 29, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not
make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over1
Financial Considerations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2
issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective
September 1, 2006.  Applicant requested and was granted an extension of time to file his Answer;
he responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer received on March 7, 2007.  He
requested a hearing. 
Department Counsel on March 21, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter
was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was
agreed to; and a Notice of Hearing, issued on March 30, 2007, set the matter for April 17, 2007, at
a location near where Applicant works and lives.
 
At the hearing the Government offered seven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-7: TR 10-17) which were
admitted  into evidence. Applicant testified, but called no witnesses.   Applicant requested five to3
six months to clear up his debts.  (TR 30)  However, I granted Applicant three weeks to submit
additional evidence to which the Government consented;  and Department Counsel had one week
to review it.  (TR 31-33, 41-42, 79, 88)  
Applicant submitted Exhibits A, a debt payment schedule on May 3, 2007.  On May 9,
2007, Government’s counsel indicated no objection; so the document was admitted into evidence
and the record closed.  The transcript (TR) was received on April 26, 2007.
       He was allowed additional time to submit letters of reference or evaluations, but did not submit any such4
evidence.  (TR 40-41)

FINDINGS OF FACT
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:
Applicant, 48 years old, who has worked for a defense contractor  from October 2002 to4
present, is a systems analyst.  He now earns $76,000 annually.  He completed a Security Clearance
Application (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in October 2004.  Previously, he worked as a
network administrator for another employer from January 2000 to October 2002 in a different
geographic location. From February 1996 to January 2001 he was a network administrator at
another company; and he earned $42,000. From January 2002 to January 2003 he took classes at
an online university, but received no degree.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 39-40; 42-47)  Applicant has not
served in the military.  (Exhibit 1) He was married in 1990 but divorced in January 2000; he has
three children born in 1975, 1978 and 1980.  (Exhibit 1; TR 42-43) He currently has no one
financially dependent on him.  (TR 47)
Finances
Applicant explained that when he was married and even when he was not married, he “just
ran into some tough times.”  He explained he was living beyond his means.  Things “kept going
downhill” for him.  He has an intent to take care of his debts.  (TR 19; 48-50)  He  has twice filed
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy as he was following the advice of lawyers.  In 1993 he had debts of over
$47,000 discharged (SOR ¶1.a.); in 2000 he had debts totaling over $100,000 discharged after his
divorce, including a house purchased for $70,000 that was foreclosed (SOR ¶1.b.).  (Answer;
Exhibits 6, 7; TR 20-22; 50-52)  
Since his 2000 bankruptcy, Applicant admitted he developed new debts from the misuse
of credit cards.  (TR 23)  He also has gone to casinos, but claims he does not use his credit card
at casinos.  Nonetheless, he admitted he was unable to pay his car payments because of his losses
at the casino of approximately $5,000 to $6,000 in 2006 (SOR 1.u.).  He lost $800 in 2007.  In
November 2006 Applicant consulted a credit repair corporation to address his credit issues as his
current indebtedness is over $23,000 to 25 creditors.  Even though he paid them an initial fee of
$150 and subsequently paid them $300, he did not offer any evidence of how they helped to contest
or resolve any of his debts.  (Exhibit 2; TR 29-30, 36; 60-61; 67-68; 74-76) While he denied
several of his debts, he never documented any of his dispute with the creditors.  (TR 23)  
Recently, he contacted another individual to help him resolve his debt issues, but he
provided no documentation of progress from those efforts except for a plan to make gradual
payments to fifteen of those creditors.  (TR 28, 36-37; 69-70; Exhibit A)  He has never taken any
classes on financing or budgeting. (TR 76)  He has no savings. (TR 79)   While he submitted a plan
to pay 15 of the debts in May 2007, he submitted no evidence that, in fact, he had made any
payments on the debts in his payment schedule.  (Exhibit A) He provided no evidence that he has
4
resolved any of the debts alleged in the SOR which are document on three credit reports from
2005, 2006, 2007.  
The current status of these debts is as follows:

POLICIES
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an
individual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security
concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding
whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or
absence of any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the
evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication
Guidelines:
Guideline F:  Financial Considerations
18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules
and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness
and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it
may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known
sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable
criminal acts.
 The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate
that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to
classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate
persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant
or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to
do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and
conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance
decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to
the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is
not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is5
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a security clearance.
CONCLUSIONS
       20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that6
it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment.

Financial Considerations
     
The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant’s financial problems reflected
not only by his having discharged substantial debts under Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings in 1993 and
in 2000, but also by his continuing pattern of accumulating substantial debts that has persisted.
He admitted his gambling debts of $5,000 to $6,000 contributed to his car being repossessed.   In
2007 he had lost an estimated $800 through gambling. Consequently, Financial Considerations
Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG ¶ 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), DC, AG
¶ 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and  AG ¶ 19(i), (compulsive or addictive
gambling as indicated by unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling. . . . borrowing money to fund
gambling or pay gambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by gambling) apply. 
With the government’s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  While he has a good
income and limited expenses, he has made no demonstrable efforts to resolve his credit problems
which continue to raise security concerns.  While he consulted two different sources for help with
credit counseling, he has not utilized their expertise to document either that he has contested or
paid any of these numerous debts.  The only debt being paid is an IRS lien through wage
garnishment where he still owes the IRS money.  Consequently, Applicant has not established a
case in mitigation.  For example, he provided no evidence under Mitigating Condition (MC) AG
¶ 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Neither was there substantial
mitigating evidence under AG ¶ 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the
circumstances).  While his divorce might be a mitigating factor in the 2000 bankruptcy, he has
been single since then and continued to accumulate debt.   Since, he continues to gamble in 2007
and sustain losses, AG ¶ 20(a)  cannot apply as the financially irresponsible behavior continues.6
While he stated an intent to pay some debts and developed a plan for how he might pay
certain debts over the next six months, Applicant has not demonstrated that he has paid even one
debt, large or small, except for his IRS garnishment payments.  Thus, he fails to meet  AG ¶ 20(d),
(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).
While he has a professional position with a good income, his failure to resolve his debts and his
continuing to gamble creates an ongoing security concern.  
Whole Person Analysis
Having considered both the record and Applicant in light of the “whole person” concept,
I conclude he is an earnest person who has struggled with reforming his financial practices; but he
9
has not made sufficient progress even after he has stated an intent to do so.  While the 1993 and
2000 bankruptcies were a legal method of dealing with the financial delinquencies, he
subsequently failed to change his practices and since 2000 has accumulated over $20,000 in debt
to over two dozen creditors despite a current income of $76,000 and a current monthly rental of
$510.  He has developed no budget and does not understand where his money goes.  His failure
to address the ongoing debt, in part created from gambling, continues to raise security concerns.
The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is high even though he has an
employment history since 2002. In sum, the likelihood of new debts and related problems is high.
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security
concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.
through 1.y. under SOR Paragraph 1.
FORMAL FINDINGS
After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines
in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the
following formal findings:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a through 1.y. Against Applicant
DECISION
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
