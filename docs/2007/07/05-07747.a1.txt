APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On June 19, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On December 27, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.
Foreman denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant
to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
2
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that
the security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.
Applicant argues that the Judge’s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did
not give sufficient weight to Applicant’s mitigating evidence which shows that Applicant has held
a security clearance without incident for approximately 20 years and has now established a plan to
pay off his outstanding debts.  In his brief, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of an
additional statement about his continuing efforts to resolve his financial problems.  The Board does
not find Applicant’s arguments persuasive. 
The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Its
submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799
at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).
The absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance
decision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to
properly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See
Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An
applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security
implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's
Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of
security concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine an applicant's
security eligibility.  A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.
03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004). 
“[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.” Dorfmont v. Brown,
913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the governmentth
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.
The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn
simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR
Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence
does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,
the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs
the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of
the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.
In this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting
financial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had delinquent debts and was still
in the process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could
reasonably conclude that Applicant’s financial problems were still ongoing.  The Judge weighed the
mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying
conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person
factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in
mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government’s security concerns.  The Board does not
review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to
3
demonstrate the Judge’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.
03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 28, 2006).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge’s ultimate
unfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines F is sustainable.
Order
The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
