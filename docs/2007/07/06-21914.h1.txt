STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On December 12, 2002, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
December 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a
security clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its2
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department
of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to
Applicant when the SOR was issued.
On January 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing
was issued on April 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 3, 2007. Due to caseload
considerations, the case was reassigned to me on April 30, 2007. The hearing was conducted as
scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted three exhibits, Exs. 1-3, and Applicant
submitted five exhibits, Exs. A-E. All of the exhibits were admitted into the record without
objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 18, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d. Those
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegation under
subparagraph 1.a.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 45 years old and has worked as a senior systems engineer for a defense
contractor since 1998. He has held a security clearance in the past. He graduated from college in
1992 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He was married in 1995 and has a grown
stepdaughter.
Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from
approximately 1980 to at least October 2005. He testified that he has not consumed any alcohol since
October 2005.  He denies the SOR allegation that he continued to consume alcohol to at least August3
2006.

In October 1983, while he was in college, Applicant was walking from one apartment to
another on campus with an open bottle of beer. Campus police cited him for having an open
container of alcohol.  He was convicted of drinking in public and fined $10. 4
In October 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty, and
fined $350; all but $100 was suspended. He was ordered to attend an alcohol counseling program
and his 90-day jail sentence was suspended.
In October 1993, he was again charged with drinking in public and fined about $10. He
complied with the court order.
In October 2005, Applicant was on an out-of-state business trip. The first day of the trip, he
fell down the brow of a ship and suffered a severe sprain to his knee and a deep bruise.  He was5
given medication. He took a prescribed anti-inflammatory drug, Naproxen.  He was not informed6
that this drug should not be used when consuming alcohol.  He requested that the job send a7
replacement for him. A couple of days later, he had dinner with his replacement and some other
coworkers.  Applicant had two beers and some rum.  He forgot to give the replacement his business8 9
file. Rather than wait until the next day, Applicant drove to the replacement’s hotel. He was pulled
over by the police because the car’s taillights were out. The officer smelled alcohol. Applicant was
given a field sobriety test, which indicated he had consumed alcohol.
On October 22, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He pled guilty and was
sentenced to 365 days in jail, 364 days suspended, with the option of eight hours of community
service in lieu of jail, placed on five years of unsupervised probation, fined $5,000, with $4,000
suspended, ordered to attend an alcohol assessment program, and ordered not to possess or consume
alcohol. According to his facility security officer, Applicant’s jail term was suspended since he opted
for eight hours of community service, which he completed.  He completed the court ordered10
counseling in March 2006, and is currently on supervised probation.11
Applicant was in an outpatient alcohol treatment program for 12 weeks after his 2005
conviction. Twice a week he attended specialized intensive outpatient treatment for group therapy,

education, and case management.  During the treatment period, he attended 36 Alcoholic12
Anonymous (AA)  meetings. He also passed several random Breathalyzer tests and two random urine
drug screens.  His diagnosis at discharge was Alcohol Abuse, in remission, made by a licensed13
clinical social worker at a center for alcohol and drug specialized outpatient programs. 14
Six witnesses testified at the hearing, and they all provided written character reference
letters.  The first witness is Applicant’s supervisor and he has a top secret clearance.  He first met15 16
Applicant in 1993 and they continued their friendship through the years. At work, the witness sees
Applicant every day and they have been deployed together overseas.  They have both a personal and17
professional relationship.  Applicant called him within 24 hours of his DUI arrest in 2005.  This18 19
witness believes Applicant’s actions that evening were a mistake and a misjudgment.  He continues20
to endorse Applicant for a security clearance because after that 2005 incident, Applicant no longer
drinks alcohol.21
The second witness has been Applicant’s coworker since 1994.  They see each other daily,22
which includes social interactions away from the job.  He testified that Applicant is a “very honest23
and forthright person, very trustworthy.”  He has never seen Applicant intoxicated and stated that24
he has not witnessed Applicant having a drink since his 2005 incident.25

The third witness has worked for five years as a security officer at Applicant’s place of
employment and has known him during that entire period.  She was familiar with the SOR and26
stated:  “I think he’s [Applicant] very responsible. I don’t think he is a cause for any national security
concern at all. I’ve seen a lot worse as a security officer.”  She monitored him to make sure he27
complied with the court’s orders, which he did.28
The fourth witness, Applicant’s brother, reported that in their frequent family visits, he has
seen his brother drink but has never seen him intoxicated or impaired.  Both his wife and sister29
testified and they both believe that the 2005 incident was an aberration and not typical of the
behavior of Applicant.  30
POLICIES
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”  As Commander in Chief, the President has31
“the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person
access to such information.”  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to32
grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  An applicant has the ultimate burden of33
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her
security clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant34
should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such
sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a35
determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not
Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.36
6
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a
clearance.  36
The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and
mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed
in the Directive and AG ¶ 2(a).
CONCLUSIONS
Alcohol consumption is a security concern because “excessive consumption often leads to
the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions
about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.” (AG ¶ 21.)
In 1983 and 1993, Applicant was charged with drinking in public. In 1990 and 2005,
Applicant was charged with DUI. All of his alcohol-related offenses show a pattern of misusing
alcohol. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition ¶ 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents
away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,
disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies.
Various factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. His first offense for DUI
occurred in 1990. He was fined, his jail sentence was suspended, and he was ordered to attend
alcohol counseling, which he did. About 15 years later, he had another DUI. He pled guilty to that
charge. He was ordered to attend alcohol counseling and not to possess or consume alcohol. His
facility security office monitored him and made sure he completed his court-ordered sentence. He
attended an outpatient alcohol treatment for 12 weeks. He also attended 36 AA meetings. His
diagnosis of alcohol abuse, in remission, was made by a licensed clinical worker, at a center for
alcohol and drug specialized outpatient programs. Moreover, he has not had an alcoholic drink since
the October 2005 DUI. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions ¶ 23(b) (the
individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provided evidence of
actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol
dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) and ¶ 23(d) (the individual has successfully
completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare,
has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in
accordant with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics
Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized
alcohol treatment program) apply. Applicant has mitigated the Government’s case. Allegations 1.a
through 1.d of the SOR are found for Applicant. 
I have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the “whole person”
concept in evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant
has had a drinking history since from 1980 to at least October 2005. He had been drinking
7
responsibly, except for his two DUIs. However, the DUIs were 25-years apart. Applicant testified
credibly about his remorse for his 2005 drinking infraction. He followed the court-ordered directive
and has abstained from alcohol since October 2005. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated,
I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: For Applicant
DECISION
In light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.
