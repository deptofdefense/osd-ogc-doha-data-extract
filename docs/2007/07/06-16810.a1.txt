APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On August 31, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of
Applicant also argues that the Judge’s adverse Formal Finding as to SOR ¶ 1.a was factual or legal error. 
1
The Board has reviewed the Judge’s decision as a whole and concludes that the Judge considered Applicant’s
conduct mitigated under the relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors, but that Applicant was
disqualified from having a security clearance by application of 10 U.S.C. § 986 based upon the facts alleged in SOR
¶ 1.b.  Accordingly, the Board need not address that issue.
2
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2007, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Jacqueline T.
Williams denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant
to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
The Appeal Board construes Applicant’s brief as requesting that he be granted a waiver of
10 U.S.C. § 986.   The Appeal Board does not have authority to grant waivers of 10 U.S.C. § 986.1
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11041 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2006).  Only the Director, DOHA or
his designee has the authority to grant waivers in meritorious cases. See “Implementation of
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Dec. 29,
2005).”  There is no provision for waiver recommendations by Judges or others.  See DOHA
Operating Instruction 64, as revised, Sept. 12, 2006 (“. . . the Administrative Judge shall not opine
whether a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 is merited, nor recommend whether to consider the case for a
waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986"). 
The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party
has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful
error.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is affirmed.  The
Board will refer Applicant's case to the Director DOHA for further consideration pursuant to the
Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum dated August 30, 2006.
