Applicant had four delinquent debts listed on the SOR. He borrowed money to invest in
the stock market, and the market declined in 2001 resulting in large financial losses. His wife
lost her job. He recently paid all four debts, and completed credit counseling. Financial
considerations security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On October 13, 2005, Applicant signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On1
April 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to him,  pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified2
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  The3
SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer received at DOHA on May 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.  On June 1, 2007, the case was4
assigned to me. His hearing was held on June 28, 2007. Applicant requested, and I agreed to
hold the record open until July 10, 2007 for Applicant to provide evidence of payment and
financial counseling (record of proceedings (R.) 35-36). DOHA received the hearing transcript
on July 10, 2007. On July 10, 2007, Department Counsel indicated she had no objection to my
consideration of Applicant’s additional evidence, which I admitted into evidence (Ex. B). I
closed the record on July 10, 2007. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant’s response to the
SOR admitted responsibility for all four delinquent SOR debts listed in the SOR, and
stated he would settle his debts.

Applicant is 47 years old (R. 7).  He received a bachelor’s degree in electrical5
engineering from a university in 1982 (R. 7). He married his current spouse in 1994.
He has one child, who was born in 1999. A government contractor has employed him
for 25 years as a systems engineer (R. 8). He has held a secret clearance for more
than 20 years (R. 8).     
Applicant used credit cards to borrow money to invest in internet stocks listed
on the stock market (R. 21-22). He charged $50,000 to $60,000 on credit cards (R.
22). The market declined in 2000-2001, and in 2002 several companies went
bankrupt. He lost his investment (R. 23). In 2001, Applicant’s spouse lost her job
because of the post-September 11, 2001, business slowdown (R. 23). She was
unemployed for about 18 months (R. 24). Applicant’s father had lung cancer and he
provided financial support of about $500 per month to his father (R. 24). In 2004, he
recovered financially and began negotiations with his creditors (R. 17).  
The following table lists the amounts of the SOR debts, and their current
status.
For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($10,075), on May 10, 2007, the creditor agreed to
settle the account for $2,003 (Ex. A at 2; R. 27). On May 18, 2007, Applicant paid
the creditor, resolving the debt (Ex. B at 4; R. 27). 
For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($9,958), on June 8, 2007, the creditor agreed to
settle the debt for $8,885 (Ex. A at 5; R. 29). On June 11, 2007, Applicant paid the
creditor, resolving the debt (Ex. A at 6; Ex. B at 6; R. 30).
For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($3,606), on May 9, 2007, the creditor agreed to
settle the debt for $2,250 (Ex. A at 3; R. 30). On June 1, 2007, Applicant paid the
creditor, resolving the debt (Ex. B at 6; R. 30-31).
For the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($15,944), on May 9, 2007, the creditor agreed to
settle the debt for $7,785 (Ex. A at 4; R. 31). On May 25, 2007, Applicant paid the
creditor resolving the debt (Ex. B at 4; R. 31).
Applicant received credit counseling and on July 9, 2007, prepared a budget
(Ex. B at 8-9). His gross salary is $82,000 per year (R. 26). His monthly net income
is $4,220. His monthly expenses include his house payment ($375), groceries ($600),
utilities ($360), insurance ($372), gasoline and car expenses ($225), clothing ($200),
and miscellaneous ($70) (Ex. B at 9). His monthly expenses total approximately
$2,000. Applicant has credit cards, but he pays them off every month (R. 25). He has
$25,000 in savings (R. 26). He had the ability to pay his debts earlier, but when he
dealt with his creditors they were unpleasant (R. 32). More recently, his creditors
were cooperative and willing to work with him (R. 33).  
     
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge
must consider the “Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access
to Classified Information” (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for
each AG, the AGs are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating
Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for access to
classified information. These AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead,
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these AGs in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG ¶ 2.
An administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and
common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a
number of variables known as the “whole person concept,” an administrative judge
should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG ¶ 2(c).
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at AG ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)
the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the
time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence
or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,
the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny
doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information
will be resolved in favor of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). In reaching this decision, I
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

In the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of
establishing controverted facts by substantial evidence, demonstrating, in
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. Once the
government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,  the6
burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and
[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating
condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App.
Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures during off-duty hours.
The government has a special relationship with those who have a security clearance
and reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in them. Decisions under this
Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance,
loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
AG ¶ 18 articulates the Government’s concern concerning financial problems.
“Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to
See  ISC R  C ase  N o .  02 -3 1 1 5 4  a t  5  (A p p .  B d . Sep .  22 ,  20 0 5 ) .8

abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s
reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An
individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal
acts to generate funds.” 
Two disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying in this case: “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “a
history of not meeting financial obligations.” AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).  
Applicant admitted he was responsible for all four of the SOR debts. The
Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions,
and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating
condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the
Government.8
Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20(a)-(e)
are potentially applicable: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the
circumstances;
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or
is under control;
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
Applicant paid the four SOR debts in May and June 2007. The AGs do not
define “recent,” and there is no “bright-line” definition of what constitutes “recent”
conduct. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude AG ¶9
20(a) partially apples. Because Applicant had multiple delinquent debts, which were

unpaid when the SOR was issued, the first two prongs of AG ¶ 20(a) are against him.
However, he meets the third prong of AG ¶ 20(a) because he has shown sufficient
efforts and unusual circumstances for concluding that such financial problems are
“unlikely to recur.” The unusual circumstances are the poor choices in 2000
(borrowing money to invest in the stock market), which caused him to make
purchases he could not afford. His investments declined in value from 2000 to 2002,
as well as his wife’s unemployment in 2001 and 2002 caused his financial
circumstances to deteriorate. However, his financial circumstances steadily
improved after 2002, and financial counseling will help him with his budget and
assist him in avoiding future debts. His recent, aggressive efforts to resolve his
delinquent SOR debts remove any doubts concerning his “current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  
Applicant disclosed some information to support application of AG ¶ 20(b).10
The initial delinquent debts resulted from the stock market decline and his wife’s
unemployment. The record did not disclose any information indicating his actions
were in bad faith. However, Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of
AG ¶ 20(b) because he did not act more aggressively to resolve his delinquent debts. 
Applicant receives credit under AG ¶ 20(c) because there is sufficient
evidence that he has received financial or credit counseling, and his SOR debts are
paid. His financial problems are resolved. 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to
establish that Applicant showed “good faith” in the resolution of his debts.  He11
does, however, receive some credit for paying his debts even though the pertinent 4-
year state statute of limitations rendered his debts legally uncollectable. See Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for
contracts); 16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont’l Casualty Co. v. Dr.
Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 F.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility
Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d 508, 513-514 (5  Cir. 2004)th
(discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts). 
The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and
judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations
in that they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by
giving security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy
consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of
law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes
of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set
period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-
barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from
sitting on their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental
to our judicial system.
 
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552
(S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
The elimination of his delinquent debts reduces his potential vulnerability to
improper financial inducements. The degree that he is “financially overextended,” is
also eliminated. However, it does not negate his past conduct in failing to take more
aggressive and timely actions to maintain communications with his creditors and to
resolve his financial jeopardy in a more timely fashion. 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not applicable. He did not provide “documented proof to
substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the
issue” with respect to any of his delinquent SOR debts.
In sum, he has demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns to
merit application of mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 20(c), as well as partial
application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), (b), and (d). These adjudicative AGs are further
addressed in the whole person analysis portion of this decision, infra. See ISCR 04-
07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under
adjudicative AGs for debts being resolved through garnishment). His aggressive
actions in May and June 2007 to obtain financial counseling, set up a budget and his
payment of his delinquent debts are particularly noteworthy.  
 
“Whole Person” Analysis
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have
considered the general adjudicative AGs related to the whole person concept under AG
¶ 2(a). As noted above, Applicant’s failure to make greater progress resolving his
delinquent debts is a serious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to
raise a security concern. His actions were knowledgeable and voluntary. All of his
delinquent debts were paid at the time the record was closed. He is 47 years old,
sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. The motivation for his
failure to pay his debts was insufficient income, and reluctance to work with some of
See  IS C R  C ase  N o .  04 -06 2 4 2  a t  2  (A p p .  B d .  June  28 ,  20 0 6 ) .  1 2
his creditors. Delinquent debts are inconsistent with prudent and responsible behavior.
A person “who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts
to generate funds” and as such the potential for pressure and exploitation is raised.    
Applicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. His
financial problems were aggravated by lack of income, unemployment, the stock
market slump, and his father’s lung cancer. He paid his delinquent SOR debts in May
and June 2007, even they were collection-barred by the pertinent state’s 4-year statute
of limitations. The elimination of his delinquent debts has reduced his potential
vulnerability to improper financial inducements. Prior to payment of his creditors,
none of his SOR creditors filed a judgment or took other judicial action against him,
which is an indication of the lack of financial pressure upon him. He received
financial counseling. He has held a clearance for many years without a security
violation. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his employer’s rules or
requirements, his forthright and candid statement at his hearing, and his evident
sincerity about making future financial progress all weigh in his favor. He pays his
credit cards off every month, and he has $20,000 in his savings account. In sum, the
likelihood of recurrence is low because sufficient evidence was presented about
improvement in his overall financial situation, the absence of evidence of other
delinquent debts, and financial counseling.  
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the
security concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The evidence leaves me
without doubts as to Applicant’s security eligibility and suitability.  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”12
and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the
