On July 2, 2007, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision in this case.  On July 12, 2007,
Applicant submitted a request for clarification and/or reconsideration of this decision.  Department
Counsel submitted a response on July 23, 2007.  
The Board has inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider its decisions.  However,
there is no right to reconsideration; the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise
its inherent authority to reconsider one of its decisions.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0621 at 1-2 (App.
Bd. Nov. 23, 1999).  
Applicant identifies three ostensible errors which he contends support his motion for
reconsideration.  The Board has considered Applicant’s brief and concludes that only one of these
contentions is meritorious.  However, as the error in question is merely typographical, it is harmless.
Accordingly, Applicant’s request is denied.
