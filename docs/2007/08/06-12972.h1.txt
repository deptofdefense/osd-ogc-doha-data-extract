SYNOPSIS
Applicant emigrated to the United States in 1988. He was born and grew up in
Nigeria. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003, and received his U.S.
passport shortly thereafter. Applicant’s use, renewal, and possession of a current
Nigerian passport pose an unacceptable security concern. Moreover, he deliberately
falsified his security clearance application. His favorable information is not
sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On September 21, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application
(GE 1, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing). On October 11,
2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline B
(Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline E (Personal
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that
DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified
information and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security
determination.  On December 20, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a1
hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007. On June 4, 2007, I convened a
hearing at which the government presented five exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support
the SOR. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented two witnesses and five
exhibits, marked AE 1-5. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.b, and 2.a – 2.c,
with explanations. He denied that he deliberately falsified his security clearance
application as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.b, and ¶ 4.a. His admissions are
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of
record, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
Applicant is a 47-year-old security officer, working for a government
contractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Nigeria (GE 1). He has never been
married and has no children. He completed primary and secondary education in a
small town in Nigeria. At around age 20, he moved to a large city in Nigeria, and
from approximately 1980 to 1986, worked for a private bank and played soccer. In
1988, at the age of 29, he emigrated to the United States (Tr. 32). 
From 1988 to 2005, Applicant worked at an American Christian academy
teaching English, mathematics, social studies, science, physical education, and bible
studies to children in first to eight grades. In 1994, he began attending an American
university and received a bachelor’s degree in English in 2002. Applicant became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2003, and received his U.S. passport shortly
thereafter. He completed a master’s degree in business administration (human
resources) in 2005. In September 2005, he was hired by his current employer, a
government contractor, and issued an interim security clearance. His company
provides security to a sensitive U.S. agency. He requires access to classified
information to retain his job (Tr. 8).
Applicant has one brother and one sister who are citizens and residents of
Nigeria. His brother is 67 years old, and he is a widow. Applicant’s brother is
retired. He served as a medic in the Nigerian armed forces for more than 10 years
prior to his retirement (Tr. 42-43). Applicant did not know whether his brother was
an officer. He only remembered his brother worked as a health care provider.
Applicant claimed he did not know what is his brother’s current occupation, if any. 
Applicant’s sister is 57 years old, and a widow. She retired from her job at a
private television station. He calls his siblings once or twice a month, and provides
financial support to both. Applicant believes it is his obligation as a brother and as a
Christian to help his siblings. He has been sending his siblings $100-$200 every two
to three months for many years. They divide the money among themselves based on
their needs (Tr. 44-47).
Section 17.d of Applicant’s September 2005 security clearance application,
required him to disclose whether within the preceding seven years he had an active
passport issued to him by a foreign government. Applicant answered “No,” and
failed to disclose that he was in possession of a valid Nigerian passport. He renewed
his passport in August 2000, and the new passport had an expiration date of August
2005. Applicant again renewed his Nigerian passport on or about August 2005, and it
now has an expiration date in August 2010. He brought his active Nigerian passport
to the hearing. Consistent with his prior statements, Applicant testified he was
willing and ready to surrender his Nigerian passport.
Applicant explained he answered “No” to Section 17.d, because he mistakenly
believed his country of birth, Nigeria, was not a foreign country. Because he was
born in Nigeria, to him Nigeria is not a foreign country. He did not know that for
purposes of the security clearance application, any passport from any nation except
the United States is considered a foreign passport (Tr. 54). 
Section 18 of Applicant’s September 2005 security clearance application,
required him to list any foreign countries he had visited during the preceding seven
years. He disclosed his travel to Germany from April 2004 to May 2005; to Germany
and Poland during August 2004; and to the United Kingdom during August 2002.
Applicant failed to disclose he traveled to Nigeria in August 2000, July 2001, and
April 2004. 
In January 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator
concerning the possession of an active Nigerian passport and his foreign travel.
Following that interview, he sent an e-mail (dated January 2006) to the investigator
clarifying his foreign travel (AE 1). The e-mail shows Applicant traveled to Finland
and Nigeria during July-August 2001; to Denmark and Germany during July 2002; to
Nigeria during April-May 2004; and to Germany and Poland during August 2004.
His last foreign travel was to Poland in June 2006 (GE 2). In a letter to DOHA, dated
September 12, 2006, Applicant disclosed that in 2002 he traveled through London to
Nigeria for a family visit (GE 3).
Applicant testified that the information in his security clearance application
had several mistakes that he tried to correct. Specifically, he meant to write 2004 as
the year he traveled to Nigeria to attend his mother’s funeral. He also explained that
he did not disclose any trips to Nigeria because, since he was born in Nigeria, he did
not consider Nigeria a foreign country (Tr. 58). In 2004, Applicant’s mother passed
away. In April 2004, he traveled to Nigeria using both his U.S. passport and his
Nigerian passport. He explained he did not have the time to go through the process of
requesting a visa in order to attend his mother’s funeral. 
While holding his interim clearance, Applicant had access to classified
information. There is no evidence to show Applicant failed to comply with the rules
and procedures for handling classified information (Tr. 158). His interim clearance
was withdrawn as a result of the security concerns under adjudication. The
government has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, Applicant is anything
other than a loyal U.S. citizen.
Applicant strongly averred he is a loyal U.S. citizen with personal,
professional, and financial commitments in the United States. He promised to defend
and take arms for the United States against any enemies. He emigrated to the United
States seeking the many opportunities offered and a better quality of life. He is a
law-abiding person, and would not knowingly violate the laws of the United States.
He was improved his lifestyle while in the United States by attending college and
advanced education. Additionally, he has made positive contributions to the
community through his services with a Christian church. He participated in the
church’s outreach program visiting the needy, the elderly, and State prisons (Tr. 31).
Applicant’s witnesses and references, most of them pastors and members of
his Church, have known him for 10 to 15 years. They consider Applicant an excellent
teacher, a model citizen, and role model. Applicant has established a reputation for
  D ire c t ive , S ec tio n  6 .3 .  s ta te s,  “E a ch  c le ara nc e  d ec is io n  m ust  b e  a  fa ir  and  im p a rt ia l co m m o n2

being trustworthy, honest, caring, and for having high moral standards. He is not
considered the type of person who would falsify a security clearance application or
violate the law.
I take administrative notice of the following facts. Nigeria is a federal
republic composed of 36 states and a capital territory. The government’s human
rights record is poor, and government officials at all levels commit serious abuses
including politically motivated and extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest
and detention, infringement on privacy rights, freedom of speech, and press. Areas
of the country are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflict
between religious, political, and ethnic factions. The lack of law and order in the
country poses considerable risks to travelers.
The Nigerian government provides strong diplomatic support to U.S.
government counter-terrorism efforts. It has condemned terrorist attacks against the
United States and supported military actions against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. It
also has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in
their region. The United States provides the people of Nigeria with substantial
financial assistance in areas such as public health, education, and in their efforts of
developing effective institutions of democratic governance. Nigeria is an important
trading partner of the United States. There is no evidence of economic competition
with the United States, or that Nigeria has or ever had an intelligence gathering
program targeting U.S. economic, industrial, or military critical technologies. 
POLICIES
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost
are the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline
applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are
not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a
disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or
against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common
sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the2
whole person concept.  Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude3
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline E
(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the applicable relevant
adjudicative guidelines.

  See  Id ;  A G  ¶  2 (b) .7
The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving4
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must
establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts5
to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government’s case. Because no
one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of
persuasion.  6
A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,
therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national
interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest”
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability
for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.7
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance,
loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government’s concern is that
foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided
loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to
help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.
interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.
Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign
country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but
not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target
United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk
of terrorism. AG ¶ 6.

The government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially
disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence
and prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a
mitigating condition never shifts to the government.

applicable to these disqualifying conditions:

In deciding whether Applicant’s family members are in a position to be
exploited, I considered Nigeria’s form of government.  Nigeria is a developing9
country that, so far, posses no intelligence, economic, or industrial threat to the
United States. Notwithstanding Nigeria’s poor human rights record, there is no
evidence its government seeks classified and industrial/economic information from
the United States. Nor is there evidence of the Nigerian government mistreating
relatives of U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens to obtain such information. Additionally,
given the existing relationship between the governments of the United States and
Nigeria, it is unlikely Nigeria would risk loosing an important trading partner and
the financial support of the United States.

Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable
judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and
regulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide
truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure
to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.
Regarding SOR ¶ 3.a, Applicant admitted he failed to disclose that during the
seven years preceding his security clearance application he traveled to Nigeria (in
2000), to Finland and Nigeria (during July-August 2001); to Denmark, Germany, and
Nigeria (in 2002), and Nigeria (in 2004). Applicant testified he failed to disclose his
travels to Nigeria because he believed Nigeria was not a foreign country and the
United States was aware of his country of origin and that he had a Nigerian passport. 
Concerning SOR ¶ 3.b, Applicant admitted he failed to disclose that he had a
valid Nigerian passport during the seven years preceding his security clearance
application. He vehemently denied, however, that his omission was deliberate or
with the intent to mislead the government. Applicant testified he mistakenly did not
consider his country of birth a foreign country and failed to disclose he had a valid
Nigerian passport. He believed the United States government was aware of his
possession of a Nigerian passport because it was stamped numerous times by
immigration authorities when he departed and entered the United States. 
Considering Applicant’s age, maturity, work history, level of education, travel
history, and his demeanour and testimony, I find his omissions were deliberate.
Analyzing the evidence as a whole, Applicant’s explanations concerning his failure
to disclose the foreign countries visited and his possession of a Nigerian passport are
not credible.
Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), criminal activity creates doubt about a
person=s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into
question a person=s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and
regulations.  As discussed under Guideline E, above, Applicant deliberately10
falsified his security clearance application. His falsification is material and a
violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1001, a felony.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) ¶ 31(a): a11
single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC ¶ 31(c): allegation or
admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally
charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply.

After considering all the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶
32, I find they are not applicable to Applicant’s case. Applicant misconduct is
recent, and not enough time has transpired for him to establish sufficient evidence of
successful rehabilitation.
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as
discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to
the whole person concept under AG ¶ 2(a). “Under the whole person concept, the
Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant’s life
separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant’s
security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and
circumstances.”  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (factors)12
which are used for “whole person” analysis. Additionally, other “[a]vailable, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be
considered in reaching a determination.” AG ¶ 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance
decision is “an overall common sense determination.” AG ¶ 2(c).    
Applicant’s testimony and his character reference statements show Applicant
is a loyal U.S. citizen. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could
cause potential harm to the United States. He takes pride in being an American
citizen and would take up arms against those who try to harm the United States. He
has worked diligently for his Christian church and for a defense contractor. 
Notwithstanding his favorable evidence, considering the totality of the facts
and circumstances, including his background, education, maturity, work history, and
outstanding character, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by
his behavior.
“Because of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong
presumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .
it is deemed best to err on the side of the government’s compelling interest in
security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.”  After weighing the disqualifying13
and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the
whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign preference, personal
conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. 
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the
SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         
Paragraph 1, Guideline C:  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.b Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline B:  FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 2.a – 2.c For Applicant
Paragraph 3, Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 3.a – 1.b Against Applicant
Paragraph 4, Guideline J:  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 4.a Against Applicant
DECISION
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a
security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
