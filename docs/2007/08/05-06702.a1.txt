APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro Se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 11, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and
2
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On March 26, 2007,
after considering the record, Administrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant’s request for
a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that
he deliberately provided false answers on his security clearance questionnaire.  Applicant’s brief also
contains new evidence, in the form of a letter from Applicant and one from Applicant’s wife, neither
of which had been previously submitted.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.
See Directive ¶  E3.1.29.
Applicant contends that he did not deliberately provide false answers concerning his past due
debts.  We have examined Applicant’s brief, the Judge’s decision, and the record as a whole.  We
conclude that the Judge’s findings of deliberate falsification are sustainable.  See Directive
E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  
 The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.
