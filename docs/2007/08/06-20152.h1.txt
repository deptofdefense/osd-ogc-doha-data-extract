the direction of a Defense Security Service Special Agent expanding the scope of his
past drug involvement is not credible.  Applicant failed to mitigate both concerns.
Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On October 10, 2001, and September 4, 2003, Applicant submitted two
separate security clearance applications (SF 86).  On August 29, 2006, the Defense1
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  2
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and
J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.
In an answer notarized on October 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On March 28, 2007,
the case was assigned to an administrative judge.  On April 4, 2007, the case was
transferred to me.  On May 2, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the
case to be heard on May 22, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  On May 31,
2007, DOHA received the transcript.
FINDINGS OF FACT 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1 and
2 with explanations.  
Applicant is 34 years old.  Since March 2006, he has been employed by a3
defense contractor working on enterprise class systems.  Tr. 90.  Additionally, in
August 2006, Applicant along with two other colleagues began their own business
providing high assurance products to clients in a classified environment.  Tr. 118.
His title in this company is chief technology officer.  His employment requires a
security clearance.  Tr. 16-18, 22.
Applicant was awarded a bachelor of science degree in May 1997, majoring in
communications.  Upon completion of his undergraduate studies, he attended
graduate school majoring in speech communications and completed all required
course work, but did not complete his thesis.  Tr. 15-16.
He has no military service. He married his wife in October 1997, and they
have one child, a seven-year-old son. 
In May 1995 at age 22, Applicant was convicted of criminal possession of a
weapon in the third degree.  In April 1995, he purchased a stolen weapon for the
purpose of committing suicide.  His attempted suicide was thwarted after his ex-
girlfriend intervened and contacted the authorities. Although his suicide attempt was
unsuccessful, his possession of a stolen weapon resulted in his being arrested,
confined for two months, and convicted of a felony.  He was sentenced to time
served and five years probation.  Tr. 23-25. GE 6. He was released from probation
for good behavior in April 1997 after serving 18 months.  Among the terms of his
probation was abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs, which he testified he
complied with.  Tr. 29-35, GE 6.
Applicant has a history of drug abuse, which formed the basis of the Personal
Conduct SOR allegations discussed below.
 Personal Conduct
Question 27 of Applicant’s October 27, 2001, SF 86 asks, “27. Your Use of
Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity – Illegal Use of Drugs Since the age of 16 or in
the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled
substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics
(opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates,
methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.)., hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription
drugs?” Applicant answered, “Yes” and listed marijuana use from August 1992 to
May 1995 once a week.  
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.a. “whereas in truth, you deliberately failed to disclose
your additional marijuana use as set forth below: (1) You used marijuana, with
varying frequency, from about May 1995 to at least 2001.”  Applicant testified on
cross-examination the range of dates involving his drug abuse from August 1993 to
May 1995 are the correct dates.  Tr. 79.
Question 27 of Applicant’s September 4, 2003, SF 86 asked the same question,
supra.  Applicant answered, “No.” 
 GE 4.4
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.b. “whereas in truth, you deliberately failed to
disclose your use of marijuana within the past seven years as set forth below: (1)
You used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about September 1996 to at least
2001.”  
On July 16, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service
(DSS) Special Agent and provided a signed, sworn statement.  Of note, Applicant
submitted this entire statement in his own handwriting.  Salient portions of that
statement include:
I used marijuana approximately 25 times between 1991 and 2001.  The
overwhelming majority of this use was from about 1991 to 1995.  I did
use marijuana a few times between 1996 and 2001.  . . . I have
absolutely no intent on using any illegal drugs in the future.  I have not
made any purposeful attempt to obtain marijuana or any other illegal
drug since 2001.  . . . The only family member I know for sure that used
illegal drugs was my father in law (. . .) and my brother in law (. . .).
To the best of my knowledge they only used marijuana. . . . I no longer
associate with anyone outside of my father in law who uses illegal
drugs.  . . . My wife has never used marijuana in my presence.  My wife
currently does not use marijuana or any other illegal drugs.  My wife
never plans on using marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.
Based upon information my wife gave me, she did use marijuana a few
times in the past, but I never saw it.  . . . I answered illegal drug
questions on my SF-86 dated 4 September 2003 incorrectly.  This was a
regretful oversight.  At the time of filling out my security forms I was
nervous and anxious about my clearance and career.   4
Applicant testified the DSS Special Agent who interviewed him advised him
that he had two statements from two separate individuals suggesting greater
marijuana usage than Applicant claimed in his SF 86s.  The net result of this
interview culminated in Applicant preparing a sworn statement, which he wrote in
his own handwriting quoted verbatim supra. Applicant testified the Special Agent
“basically told me what to write.”  Applicant further testified the Special Agent
“verbally read off what I should write in the statement.”  Applicant testified that that
the words, “I did use marijuana a few times between 1996 and 2001” were the
Special Agent’s words and not true.  After preparing the statement in his own
handwriting, Applicant initialed each paragraph before swearing its contents were
correct and true as written adding the DSS Special Agent assisted him in preparation
of this statement.  Tr. 44-58.  On cross-examination, Applicant stated he thought
during the interview, he had to write down what the Special Agent dictated even if
not true and to sign adopting the agent’s statement as his own.  Tr. 76.
Applicant discussed this statement with his wife when he got home and
testified he “felt sick to my stomach.”  Tr. 58.  In their discussions about this
statement, Applicant recalled that his wife had no recollection of her drug use.  Tr.
 GE 5.5
 GE 1, and GE 2.6
59.  Applicant did not contact his Facility Security Officer or attempt to contact DSS
to correct his statement.  When asked why he did not do either, he responded “I
didn’t know.” Tr. 59.  Applicant stated that he did not know providing a statement
was voluntary.  Tr. 71-72.
On June 12, 2003, Applicant submitted an earlier signed, sworn statement to a
DSS Special Agent.    Verbatim portions of that statement are: 5
During 1988, at age 15, I experimented with marijuana on one
occasion.  From Aug 91 to May 95, while a college student, I used
marijuana on a once weekly basis at parties and get-togethers while in
the company of college friends. . . . I stopped using marijuana in May
95 because I wanted to change my life.
Applicant provided derogatory/unfavorable information about himself in both
SF 86s in Questions 19 (Medical Record), 22 (Employment Record), 21 (Police
Record – Felony Offenses, 22 (Police Record – Firearms/Explosives Offenses, and
38 (Financial Delinquencies).  6
Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that information set forth under paragraph 1., above
constitutes a violation of Federal law, Title, 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a
felony.   
A former supervisor, colleague, and retired naval officer testified on
Applicant’s behalf and referred to him as “one of the best engineers I’ve worked
with.”  He added he was reliable and trustworthy.  Tr. 95.  Applicant’s wife testified
by telephone and stated she had never seen or suspected that her husband was
involved in any drug use since she has known him.  Tr. 110.  She denied any past
drug use.  Tr. 110-111.  She confirmed Applicant’s version of how his interview was
conducted in July 2004 by the DSS Special Agent, that being Applicant “was led to
say and write things that were not necessarily true, kind of coaxing him into saying
things that weren’t his own thoughts.”  Tr. 112.  Applicant’s business partner
testified on his behalf and stated that he never had any suspicion that Applicant was
involved in drug use since he knew him and that he was aware of his past drug use,
but was not sure of the dates involved.  Tr. 122-123.
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security or trustworthiness suitability, an
administrative judge must consider the “Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information” (Guideline[s]), which sets forth
adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each
guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions
 “ S u b s t a n t i a l  e v i d e n c e  [ i s ]  s u c h  r e l e v a n t  e v i d e n c e  a s  a  r e a s o n a b l e  m i n d  m i g h t  a c c e p t  a s7

(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified or sensitive information.
These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing
the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these
guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An
administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and
common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a
number of variables known as the “whole person concept,” an administrative judge
should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative
process factors listed at Guideline ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential
for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation
or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,
the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny
doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive]
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision,
I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of
establishing controverted facts by “substantial evidence,”  demonstrating, in7
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue an applicant’s access to classified information. Once the
Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the
burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence “to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and
[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating
“ T h e  A d m i n i s t r a t i v e  J u d g e  [ c o n s i d e r s ]  t h e  r e c o r d  e v i d e n c e  a s  a  w h o l e ,  b o t h  f a v o r a b l e  a n d8

condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App.
Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8
A person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a
fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.
This relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty
hours. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants
access to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail
to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a
certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,
risk of compromise of such information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance,
loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Guideline E (Personal Conduct)
Under Guideline ¶ E2.A5.1.1., “[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or]
dishonesty . . . could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified
information.” Of particular concern is any failure to provide truthful and candid
answers during the clearance process. One personal conduct disqualifying conditions
is particularly relevant this case. Guideline ¶ E2.A5.1.2.2. provides, “[t]he deliberate
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary
responsibilities.”  
Applicant places the trier of fact in the unenviable position of trying to
determine which version of his past drug use is true and accurate.  The security
clearance application process requires the full, frank and consistent disclosure of
past conduct – favorable and unfavorable.  Applicant offers the explanation that the
true and accurate version past drug use is the more favorable one he provided in his
October 2001 SF 86.

He would also have one believe that as a college-educated individual, who
completed all of his graduate work for this master’s degree, at age 31, would
reiterate in his own handwriting a very unfavorable and untruthful version of past
drug use dictated to him by DSS Special Agent. Not only would he have one believe
the DSS Special Agent managed to coax or coerce him to provide unfavorable past
drug use about himself, but also about his father-in-law and brother-in-law and a
rather qualified history of drug use involving his current wife.  In short, I do not find
his explanation credible and conclude his intent was to conceal the information about
the extent of his past drug use.  I accept his handwritten statement to the DSS9
Special Agent on July 16, 2004, as the most credible description of his drug use.
Guideline ¶ E2.A5.1.2. provides for seven Guideline E mitigating. 
conditions.  None of them are applicable in this case.
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)
Guideline ¶ E2.A10.1.1. articulates the Government’s concern concerning
criminal conduct stating, “[a] history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt
about a person’s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.”  One personal conduct
disqualifying conditions is particularly relevant this case. Guideline ¶ E2.A10.1.2.1.
provides, “[a]llegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the
person was formally charged.”
For a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 to occur, the falsification must be
material. The Supreme Court defined “materiality” in United States v. Gaudin, 515
U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement having a “natural tendency to influence, or [be]
capable of influencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.” See also
United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).   
I conclude Applicant provided false information during the security clearance
application process.  His false statements about his drug use are material and violate
18 U.S.C. § 1001.  The discussion under Personal Conduct, supra, applies.
  
Guideline ¶ E2.A10.1.3.1. provides for six Guideline J mitigating 
conditions.  None of them are applicable in this case.
 
 
“Whole Person” Analysis
In addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating
conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole
person. As noted above, Applicant’s failure to provide truthful, accurate and
consistent information as it pertained to his past drug use is sufficiently serious to
S e e  I S C R  C a s e  N o .  0 4 - 0 6 2 4 2  a t  2  ( A p p .  B d .  J u n e  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6 ) .  1 0
raise a security concern. His actions with respect to personal and criminal conduct
were knowledgeable and voluntary. At the time he provided false information, he was
sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.
 The motivation for Applicant’s falsification is apparently to provide a more
favorable version of his past drug abuse and to obtain a security clearance.  Such
failure to be forthright and honest raises concerns about his integrity and as such is
incompatible with access to classified information.  It casts doubt on his reliability
and trustworthiness.  
Applicant presented some extenuating and mitigating evidence.  He has
overcome substantial personal adversity following an unsuccessful suicide attempt and
felony conviction.  He was released from his probation for good behavior, although
this accomplishment is undermined by his apparent failure to comply with the terms of
his probation to remain drug free.  He went on to complete his education, got married,
and is a conscientious spouse and parent.  He is accomplished in his profession and
had the mettle to start his own business.   
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not
mitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal and criminal conduct. The
evidence leaves me with doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my “careful consideration of the whole person factors”10
and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the
Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the
Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government’s case. For the
reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to a security clearance.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the
SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         
 Paragraph 1, Guideline e:  AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
DECISION
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
