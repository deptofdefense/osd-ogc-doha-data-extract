  In his closing argument, the government noted Applicant’s amended income tax returns for tax years 2001-3
2004 (AE 21-24) were dated June 7, 2007, and that the 2005 income tax return (AE 25) was undated. Applicant’s counsel
mistakenly submitted documents showing the dates the copies were made, and not the date they were filed. He asked
to substitute the documents provided with the correct copies of the documents. The government objected. I granted
Applicant’s request in order to develop a full and accurate record. Applicant’s counsel’s June 29, 2007, cover letter to
the post-hearing submissions was marked as AE 31; the 2001 amended income tax return was marked AE 32; the 2002
amended income tax return was marked AE 33; the 2003 amended income tax return was marked AE 34; the 2004
amended income tax return was marked AE 35; and the 2005 income tax return was marked AE 36. Department
Counsel’s July 3, 2007, memorandum re-stating his objections was marked as Appellate Exhibit 1.
SYNOPSIS
From the fall of 2003 to around June 2005, Applicant knowingly employed an
illegal alien as a live-in housekeeper-babysitter. The employment of an illegal alien
violates federal law. His extensive favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate
the personal conduct security concerns raised by his behavior. Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On October 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application
(GE 1, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing). On September 28,
2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline E
(Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that DOHA adjudicators could not
make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an
administrative judge for a security determination.  On October 11, 2006, Applicant1
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007. On May 23, 2007, DOHA issued a
Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for June 19, 2007. On May 24, 2007,
Applicant’s counsel requested a postponement. I re-scheduled the hearing for June
25, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The government presented one
exhibit, marked GE 1 and the testimony of two witnesses to support the SOR.2
Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented five witnesses and 36 exhibits,
marked AE 1-36.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 6, 2007.3
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. After a thorough review of all evidence
of record, I make the following findings of fact: 
Applicant is a 43-year-old businessman. He attended high school at a state
military academy, graduating in 1983 (Tr. 211). He was admitted to a military
service academy and attended the service academy for three and one-half years. In
his third year, he used cocaine and tested positive during a drug screening urinalysis.
He was forced to withdraw from the military academy (Tr. 214-16). From June 1987
to January 1989, Applicant attended college; graduated with a bachelor’s degree in
international affairs. Applicant married his wife in August 1989, and they have three
boys of this marriage, ages 13, 11, and 8 (Tr. 210-11).
From August 1989 to December 1998, Applicant worked for two different
government contractors. In January 1999, afraid his job was being terminated,
Applicant founded his own company to provide information technology services and
solutions to the government and industry. During his first year in business,
Applicant’s company earned approximately $360,000. Thereafter, the company
experienced exponential growth. In 2006, his company employed 245 employees,
had earnings of approximately $40 million, and had over 15 contracts with different
government agencies (Tr. 220-22). His company has been recognized as one of the
50 fastest-growing companies in the technology sector in the greater Washington DC
area (Tr. 230-231). 
Applicant and his company have had access to classified information at the
secret level since approximately 2000. The available evidence shows Applicant
never failed to comply with the rules and procedures for handling classified
information. Applicant also owns four other companies, a holdings company, an
information technology services company, a real estate investment company, and a
computer equipment surplus/resale company (Tr. 224). 
Applicant’s company’s exponential growth was the result of his long hours of
hard work and sacrificing his time with his family. He and his wife divided their
labor and responsibilities; Applicant took care of managing the company, and his
wife took care of managing the home and taking care of their children (Tr. 231).
Around 2001, Applicant and his wife began to use the services of an 18-19
year-old Brazilian babysitter (V) who was recommended to them by one of their
regular babysitters. Applicant and his wife believed V was legally in the United
States. She was residing with her uncle and aunt, both of whom are American
citizens living in the United States, and her aunt is a practicing attorney in the
United States. 
After using V as a babysitter for a period of time, Applicant and his wife hired
V, from approximately June 2002 to June 2005, as their live-in housekeeper-
babysitter. Applicant did not check V’s background or legal status because he and
his wife had met with V’s aunt and uncle, they liked her after having used her as a
babysitter for some time, and he felt pressured by his wife to hire V. His wife
wanted a housekeeper-babysitter to help her take care of their home and their three
boys. He was also pressured by his feelings of guilt because of the amount of time he
was spending at work and away from his family (Tr. 277-78).
In the fall of 2003, Applicant’s wife informed him that V was illegally in the
United States (Tr. 40, 280). His wife offered V an airplane ticket to go visit her
family in Brazil. V refused it because if she left the United States she would not be
allowed to return (Tr. 40). Applicant testified he considered firing V, but continued
her employment until around June 2005. He explained she had become part of his
family, and he believed it was not the right thing to do. As a Christian, he believed
he could not throw her out into the street without a family network to support her, or
without a job (Tr. 43-44). 
Applicant and his wife offered to sponsor V into the United States, and to
assist her with her immigration problems. Applicant testified V refused any
assistance, and asked them not to interfere. V led them to believe she was already
filing for residency with the assistance of her aunt and uncle (Tr. 44, 281). In 2004,
V informed Applicant she was getting married to a U.S. citizen. Applicant believed
her marriage to a U.S. citizen would resolve her illegal status. V married in
December 2004. Applicant paid for her wedding expenses because she did not have
the financial resources, and he felt it was the right thing to do. V left Applicant’s
employment in May-June 2005 (Tr. 46). 
Around June/July 2005, Applicant realized he had a tax-wages problem
because he had not paid social security taxes on V’s wages or withheld federal
income taxes. He asked his accountant to resolve V’s wages-tax issue. He was
informed he could not pay the taxes owed because he had no social security number,
green card, or work permit number for V. Between May 2005 and January 2006, he
and his wife attempted numerous times to contact V through her husband (who works
in a bank), V’s aunt and uncle, and friends, to no avail. After she left his
employment, V did not return Applicant’s calls (except for one time she talked to
Applicant’s wife) or provide him with any information he could use to pay any due
taxes (Tr. 46-47).
In October 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application seeking
an upgrade of his access to classified information. In his security clearance
application, he disclosed he attended the service military academy. He also disclosed
that in May 2003, he illegally used his wife’s prescription drugs (Percocet) without
having his own prescription. He explained he had three prior back surgeries for a
ruptured disk. In 2003, he knew he had injured another disk while participating in a
triathlon competition during the weekend. He elected to self-medicate instead of
going to the emergency room to obtain a prescription for the medication (GE 1). The
next work day, Applicant visited his physician and obtained his own prescription. 
In December 2005, Applicant requested a legal opinion from his professional
tax preparer and asked him how to resolve V’s tax problems. At the advice of his
attorney, Applicant established a household company to pay back the overdue taxes
  AE 21-25 and AE 32-35.4
owed from 2001 to 2005 as a result of V’s employment. Applicant filed his amended
income tax returns paying the back due wage taxes for 2001-2004, and his 2005
income tax return in October 2006.   4
In January 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator.
During the interview, he voluntarily disclosed that his wife had hired an illegal alien
to work as a live-in housekeeper-babysitter, and that he had not paid social security
or withheld federal income taxes for V  (Tr. 35-37). According to the investigator’s
recollection, Applicant acted as if he did not know he was required to withhold
federal taxes for his living-in housekeeper (Tr. 63-64), and Applicant knew before
he hired V that she was an illegal alien (Tr. 84). 
Concerning his failure to pay federal taxes pertaining to V’s salary and social
security taxes, Applicant explained it was an oversight on his part because he did not
prepare his own income tax returns. Since establishing his company, Applicant has
used the services of a professional tax preparer to complete his income tax returns,
and has delegated to his office assistant the completion of his tax preparation work
sheet. He claimed the issue of paying taxes for a household employee was never
raised by his tax preparer and he never realized he had to pay such taxes. It was not
until a business meeting in the fall of 2005 that he realized he had a tax problem for
not having paid taxes pertaining to V’s employment (Tr. 49-50).
Applicant’s witnesses and references, most of whom have known him for
many years, consider him an upstanding citizen, and a role model. Applicant has
established a solid reputation for being trustworthy, honest, fair and caring, and for
having high moral standards. He is not considered the type of person who would
violate the law or fail to follow rules and regulations. Among his employees and
business associates, Applicant has established a reputation for doing what is right
and fair. Those who know him best consider him a devout Christian, a family man,
and an outstanding father.
Professionally, Applicant is a highly successful businessman. He is
recognized as a good leader, and a caring and concerned employer. He is also a
philanthropist, having made approximate $350,000 in charitable contributions to
schools, the community, and the needy from 2002 to 2007 (AE 18).
I took administrative notice of § 1324a of Title 8 of the United States Code.
The statute, generally, makes it unlawful to employ or continue to employ an illegal
alien (a person not authorized to be in the United States). This is civil statute that
provides for a potential civil fine of “not less than $250 and not more than $2,000”
for each first time violation after an administrative hearing is completed.
Applicant’s violation was not pursued by the United States.

The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
evaluating an Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost
are the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline
applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are
not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a
disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or
against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common
sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the5
whole person concept.  Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I6
conclude Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is the applicable relevant adjudicative
guideline.
BURDEN OF PROOF
The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s eligibility for
access to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving7
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must
establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts8
to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government’s case. Because no
one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of
persuasion.  9
A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,
therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national
interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest”
  S e e  I d ;  A G  ¶  2 ( b ) .1 0
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability
for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.10
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited. Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance,
loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, § 7. 
CONCLUSIONS
Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable
judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and
regulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide
truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.
From the spring of 2001 to June 2002, Applicant employed an illegal alien as
a babysitter. From June 2002 to June 2005, Applicant employed the illegal alien as a
live-in housekeeper-child care provider. He learned his live-in housekeeper was an
illegal alien in the fall of 2003. He knew or should have known that employing an
illegal alien was unlawful. Notwithstanding, he continued her employment until June
2005, when she voluntarily left her job. Applicant failed to withhold federal income
taxes and pay social security taxes on his illegal alien employee during the whole
period of time she worked for him. In October 2006, he filed amended income tax
returns for tax years 2001-2004, and his 2005 income tax returns paying his taxes.
Applicant’s overall behavior cast doubt on his judgment, his ability to comply
with rules and regulations, and make him potentially vulnerable to exploitation,
manipulation, or duress.
Personal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 16(d): credible adverse
information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be
sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all
available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules
and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly
safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to consideration of:
(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality,
release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or
other government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other
inappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule
violations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's
time or resources; and AG ¶ 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information
about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or
duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's
personal, professional, or community standing . . ., apply.
The government produced substantial evidence raising potentially
disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence
and prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving
a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.
After considering all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶
17, two are potentially applicable to Applicant’s case:
( c )  t h e  o f f e n s e  i s  s o  m in o r ,  o r  s o  m u c h  t im e  h a s  p a s s e d ,  o r  t h e  b e h a v i o r  i s  s o
i n f r e q u e n t ,  o r  i t  h a p p e n e d  u n d e r  s u c h  u n i q u e  c i r c u m s t a n c e s  t h a t  i t  i s  u n l i k e l y  t o
r e c u r  a n d  d o e s  n o t  c a s t  d o u b t  o n  t h e  i n d i v id u a l ' s  r e l i a b i l i t y ,  t r u s tw o r th in e s s ,  o r
g o o d  j u d g m e n t ;  a n d
(d) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 17(c) is partially applicable. Applicant’s offense is
a civil violation. As such, in a grading scale, it is not as serious as a criminal
offense. Applicant established that his hiring of the illegal alien, and failure to pay
social security taxes and withhold federal taxes, happened under such unique
circumstances in his life that it is not likely to recur. Applicant was starting his own
information technology company during a very difficult period of time, near to the
stock market and the “dot coms” crash. He was working very long hours to establish
his company and that kept him away from home and his family. He wife was in
charge of managing the household and taking care of their young children. Applicant
felt pressured to go along with his wife’s hiring decision without too much scrutiny.
Applicant’s situation has changed. His company seems to be solidly established, his
children are older, and he does not appear to be under the same time constraints and
business pressure he once felt. Nevertheless, his conduct does cast doubt on
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Therefore, he does not
receive full credit under AG ¶ 17(c).
Concerning mitigating condition AG ¶ 17(d), I find it fully applies. Applicant
voluntarily disclosed in his security clearance application, and to the government
investigator, his questionable behavior. The evidence also shows he disclosed to his
family, friends, and business associates that he was pending a security clearance
hearing and the reasons behind the government’s security concerns. Based on
Applicant’s disclosures, and considering his demeanour and truthful testimony, I
believe he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate any potential vulnerability
to exploitation or duress.
 I S C R  C a s e  N o .  0 3 - 0 4 1 4 7  a t  3  ( A p p .  B d .  N o v .  4 ,  2 0 0 5 )  ( q u o t in g  I S C R  C a se  N o .  0 2 -0 1 0 9 31 1
a t  4  ( A p p .  B d .  D e c .  1 1 ,  2 0 0 3 ) .
Notwithstanding the applicability of the two Guideline E mitigating
conditions as previously described, Applicant’s favorable information is not
sufficient to mitigate the overall Guideline E concerns. 
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as
discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related
to the whole person concept under AG ¶ 2(a). “Under the whole person concept, the
Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant’s life
separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant’s
security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and
circumstances.”  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (factors)11
which are used for “whole person” analysis. Additionally, other “[a]vailable, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be
considered in reaching a determination.” AG ¶ 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance
decision is “an overall common sense determination.” AG ¶ 2(c).    
Applicant hired a babysitter in 2001 believing she was legally in the United
States. By the time he discovered in the fall of 2003, that she had problems with her
visa and was illegally in the United States, the babysitter had become part of his
family. Applicant and his family established a strong relationship with her. By all
accounts, Applicant is a big–hearted person and a religious man. He believed he was
doing the right thing by protecting her, keeping her in his employment, and assisting
her to become a legal resident. 
Applicant knew, however, he also had the legal obligation not to continue his
babysitter’s employment. From the fall of 2003 to May 2005, he elected to disregard
his legal obligations because of his personal and his family concerns for the
babysitter. Applicant’s behavior, although admirable, raises concerns about his
judgment and his ability to follow rules and regulations. His behavior creates doubt
about Applicant’s ability to disclose a security violation committed by someone
close to him, if that person’s employment or financial well being would be
jeopardized by the disclosure. 
I have carefully considered all of Applicant’s favorable evidence. He was
forthright and honest during his testimony. In January 2006, he voluntarily disclosed
to an investigator that he had hired an illegal alien to work as a live-in housekeeper
and that he had unpaid tax issues to resolve. He disclosed in his security clearance
application he had illegally used his wife’s medications, and that he attended a
service military academy for three and one-half years. Applicant is considered by
those who know him best to be trustworthy, with high ethical and moral values. The
available evidence supports the conclusion that he lives a stellar life and is
considered a pillar of the community. He is also highly successful as a businessman,
and generously contributes financially and personally to the community.

Notwithstanding his extensive favorable evidence, considering the totality of
the facts and circumstances, including his background, education, maturity, business
experience, and outstanding character, Applicant failed to mitigate the security
concerns raised by his behavior.
“Because of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong
presumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .
it is deemed best to err on the side of the government’s compelling interest in
security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.”  After weighing the disqualifying12
and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the
whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign preference, personal
conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns.
