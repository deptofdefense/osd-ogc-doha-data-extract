SYNOPSIS
2
From 1998 to 2005, Applicant accumulated 52 delinquent debts totaling about $29,300. In
December 2006, she negotiated payment plans for 18 debts, paid off or resolved 14 debts, and
tendered payment on one. Four debts are disputed. Fifteen debts totaling more than $19,000 are
unresolved. Trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated.  Eligibility
for assignment to an ADP I/II/III position is denied.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On June 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement
of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a favorable
trustworthiness determination and eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.  This action was taken
under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive), and Department of Defense
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified
(Regulation).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations) of the Regulation, based on 52 delinquent debts totaling about $29,300.
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 27, 2006, admitted the debts, submitted proof
that some debts had been resolved, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The
case was assigned to me on November 9, 2006.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November
27, 2006, and the case was heard on December 11, 2006, as scheduled.   Applicant affirmatively
waived the 15-day notice required by the Directive ¶ E3.1.8 (Tr. 31).  I kept the record open to enable
Applicant to submit additional evidence.  I received the hearing transcript and Applicant’s additional
evidence on December 29, 2006.  Department Counsel’s response to her additional evidence is
attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  Her additional evidence has been incorporated into the
record as Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) L through Y.
PROCEDURAL RULING
At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting the reference to
the Regulation.  I granted the motion in part by deleting the reference to the outdated paragraph cited
in the SOR, but I denied the portion of the motion requesting that the entire reference to the
Regulation be deleted (Tr. 17-26).  I announced at the hearing that I would apply the adjudicative
guidelines in the Regulation and follow the procedures in the Directive (Tr. 25).  The issue whether
the guidelines in the Regulation or those in the Directive should apply to this case is moot, because
the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Directive under Guideline F are the same as those
in the Regulation.  Department Counsel’s post-hearing submission on the issue is attached to the
record as Hearing Exhibit II.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my
findings of fact.  I make the following findings:
Applicant is a 28-year-old beneficiary service representative employed by a defense
contractor and working at a military medical facility.  She has worked for her current employer since
July 2004, and has established a reputation for professionalism and attention to detail (AX L, M).
 One beneficiary referred to her as “his angel” in her employer’s newsletter (AX N).  Her most recent
performance appraisal scored her performance as 280 on a 300-point scale where any rating above
240 means the employee exceeded expectations (AX O).  She received salary increases in April 2005
and April 2006 for exceptional performance (AX P, Q, R). 
4
Applicant dropped out of high school before graduating.  She obtained her GED certificate
and has been enrolled as a part-time university student since 2002.  She has completed about half
the requirements for graduating from a four-year program with a major in biology (Tr. 7, 48-49). She
was married in September 2006 (Tr. 37), and she has an eight-year-old son from a previous
relationship.  She has never received a trustworthiness determination (Tr. 56).
The SOR alleges 52 delinquent debts totaling more than $29,300.  Applicant admitted all the
debts in her answer to the SOR, and she presented documentary evidence that some of the debts had
been paid.  She also produced evidence that she paid some delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR
(AX G). The following table summarizes the evidence regarding the debts alleged in the SOR.

Circumstances Surrounding the Debts
Applicant began falling behind in her financial obligations in early 2000 (Tr. 93).  While
uninsured medical expenses contributed to her financial problems, her financial situation was largely
the product of general overspending and poor financial planning.  In her interview with the security
investigator in March 2005, Applicant stated she intended to seek consumer credit counseling and
consolidate her debts (GX 3 at 2, 4).  At the hearing, she testified she was unable to enroll in a
consumer counseling program because many of her creditors were unwilling to accept installment
payments (Tr. 93-94).
The bad checks alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g were uttered to a restaurant between
October 6, 1998, and October 17, 1998, for amounts between $33.90 and $40.25.  In an interview
with a security investigator in March 2005, Applicant asserted she had no knowledge of the bad
checks, but she surmised that they might be connected to the theft of her purse in 1998 (GX 2 at 7).
She has paid off all the checks.
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h arose from the repossession of a car jointly purchased by
Applicant and her then-boyfriend.  They parted ways and the boyfriend moved to another state and
married someone else.  Applicant kept the car but was unable to make the payments.  The car was
repossessed in November 1998.  She contacted the creditor in June 2006 and learned that the creditor
obtained a judgment against the ex-boyfriend.  The deficiency owed after repossession of the car was
$8,219, but it has increased to more than $15,000 because of interest, penalties, and related costs.
Applicant had no contact with the creditor after June 2006 (Tr. 60-64).
Applicant began working for an ambulance service in February 2000 and had medical
insurance. She was treated for carpal tunnel syndrome in 2001 and for various ailments in 2003,
about which she could remember little.  Although she had medical insurance, it did not cover the
medical bills in full (Tr. 68-69).  She was unemployed from January to February 2004, and then
employed part-time with no medical insurance July 2004 (Tr. 69-70). 
The medical bills alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k were for treatment received by Applicant in
February 2000 (GX 3 at 1).  The medical bill in SOR ¶ 1.s was for treatment of her son’s ear
infections in October 2001 (GX 3 at 2).  The medical bills in SOR ¶¶ 1.ll, 1.ss, 1.tt, and 1.vv were
related to her miscarriage in February 2004 (GX 3 at 6, 9; Tr. 66-67).
7
The medical bills alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.ff, 1.gg, and 1.hh were incurred when Applicant was
in an automobile accident with a drunk driver in June 2003.  She sued the other driver and received
a settlement in December 2003.  She assumed her lawyer had settled the medical bills (GX 3 at 10).
In her security interview in March 2006, Applicant asserted that the cable service bill in SOR
¶ 1.kk had been paid in full (GX 3 at 11).  At the hearing, she admitted she had probably overlooked
this bill and that it was unpaid (Tr. 82).
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i occurred when Applicant contracted for fashion photography
in the late 1990s.  The original bill was for more than $1,200.  After paying about $500, Applicant
received only five photographs.  Because she thought she received less than she contracted for, she
refused to make any further payments (Tr. 90).
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r arose when Applicant’s apartment and furniture were damaged
by water leaking from another apartment above her.  When the apartment owner refused to pay for
the damage to her furniture, she moved out and was charged one month’s rent for early termination
of the lease.  She paid half the amount demanded, and refused to pay the remainder (Tr. 86-87).
The cell phone bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.v arose when Applicant gave her son’s grandmother
a cell phone with the understanding the grandmother would make the payments.  When the
grandmother failed to pay the bill, Applicant remained responsible (Tr. 79-80).
The debt alleged in SOR ¶1.zz occurred when Applicant switched long distance carriers but
the original carrier continued to bill her, resulting in double billing for her long distance service.
Applicant disputes this debt (Tr. 91-92).
Applicant’s Current Financial Situation
In a personal financial statement dated March 15, 2005, Applicant reported net monthly
income of $1,927.46 (including $366 in child support from her son’s father), household expenses
of $955, debt payments of $420, and a net remainder of $552.46 (GX 3 at 16).  Her income remained
at the same level at the time of the hearing (Tr. 95).  Her personal financial statement does not reflect
her student loans totaling between $25,000 and $30,000, on which payments are deferred (Tr. 105).
Her husband owns a lawn service company and earns about $1,200 per month.  He works weekends
as a musician, earning an additional $1,200 per weekend (Tr. 96).  Her husband has taken
responsibility for paying all the household expenses, allowing her to use her monthly income to pay
both her current and delinquent debts (Tr. 104).  She has virtually no savings, but she has about
$3,000 in her 401k account (Tr. 103-04, 115).  She no longer has any credit cards (Tr. 103).
In March 2005, Applicant listed monthly rent of $750, of which her fiancé paid half.  At the
hearing she testified she and her husband now pay rent of $550 (Tr. 98).  In March 2005, she also
listed a car payment of $298 among her debt payments.  This payment was for a used 1999 Dodge
truck, for which she had paid about $12,000.  It turned out to be a “lemon,” and after spending
almost $5,000 on it, she traded it for a used 2002 Mercedes C240 at a cost of more than $20,000,
increasing her monthly car payments to $623 (Tr. 98-99, 109, 118).

POLICIES
The adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation are used to make ADP trustworthiness
determinations.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures
contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.
Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  Regulation
¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.  ADP III positions are “nonsensitive positions.”  Regulation ¶
C3.1.2.2.  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions of the Directive
to ADP I, II, and III positions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
(Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 2004.  “The standard that must be met for
. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty,
reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly
consistent with the interests of national security.”  Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the
Regulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and
mitigating conditions under each guideline.  
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.”  Regulation Appendix
8 at 132.  Each eligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based
on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed
in the Regulation. 
In security clearance cases, the government  initially must present substantial evidence to
establish controverted facts in the SOR that may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for
access to classified information.  Directive ¶ E3.1.14.  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a
scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,
380 (4th Cir. 1994).  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  An applicant “has the ultimate burden
of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.”  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  “Any doubt as to whether
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor
of the national security.”  Directive ¶ E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness
determinations for ADP positions.

CONCLUSIONS
Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
Under this guideline, “[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to
engage in illegal acts to generate funds.”  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  A person who fails or
refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless
in his or her duty to protect classified information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this
guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where
an applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  DC 3 applies where an
applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Id.  Applicant’s financial history
is sufficient to raise DC 1 and DC 3.
Since the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 3, the burden
shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive
¶ E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving
it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent
debts were not recent (MC 1) or was an isolated incident (MC 2).  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.
Applicant has multiple delinquent debts that are not yet fully resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC
2 are not established.
Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the
result of conditions “largely beyond the person’s control” (MC 3).  Id.  Even if Applicant’s financial
difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, it is appropriate to consider
whether she acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.  ISCR Case
No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).
Applicant’s financial difficulties began shortly after the birth of her son in 1998, and several
events occurred that were beyond her control.  Her purse and checkbook were stolen in 1998.  She
had periods of unemployment or part-time employment that left her without medical insurance. She
was injured by a drunk driver and her car was totaled in June 2003.  She suffered a miscarriage in
February 2004.  Her son had medical problems that were not fully covered by insurance.  She gave
a cell phone to her son’s grandmother and was unaware that the grandmother neglected to pay for
the service as she had promised.  Her Dodge truck turned out to be a “lemon” requiring expensive
repairs.  
On the other hand, she did not respond reasonably to her financial difficulties.  She failed to
resolve any unpaid bills after gaining full-time employment in July 2004, even though her personal
financial statement reflects a net monthly remainder of more than $500.  Eight delinquent debts were
for less than $100, and four were for between $100 and $152, but she took no action to pay any of
her delinquent debts until shortly before the hearing.  When she needed to replace her lemon truck,
she did not purchase another similar vehicle, but instead purchased a more expensive car that
increased her monthly car payments by more than $300.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.
10
A mitigating condition (MC 4) applies when an applicant “has received or is receiving
counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control.”  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  MC 4 is not established because Applicant has not
sought financial counseling.
A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith
effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Id.  The concept of good faith “requires a showing that a person acts
in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.”  ISCR
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past
irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security
clearance.  
Applicant knew in March 2005, when she was interviewed by a security investigator, that her
financial situation raised trustworthiness concerns.  Applicant did not take any significant steps to
resolve her delinquent debts until after she received the SOR in June 2006.  Nevertheless, several
debts have been paid or resolved (SOR ¶ 1.a-1.g, 1.ee, 1.mm, 1.pp, 1.ss, 1.tt, 1.uu, and 1.yy), and
they no longer raise trustworthiness concerns.  I resolve the allegations regarding these debts in her
favor.
Applicant has disputed several debts, for reasons that I found plausible and credible.  I
resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.r, 1.u, and 1.zz in her favor.
Applicant has negotiated payment plans for several debts, with payments beginning in
December 2006 and January 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.dd, 1.ff,
1.gg, 1.hh, 1.jj, 1.nn, and 1.oo).  These payment plans are steps in the right direction, but they are
not sufficient to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under DC 1 and DC 3, for three reasons.  First,
they were negotiated under pressure of qualifying for a trustworthiness determination.  Second,
Applicant has not yet established a track record indicating she is likely to follow through on the
payment plans.  “Only with the passage of time will there be a track record that shows whether a
person, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from
acting in a way that the person has acted in the past.”  ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS
302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  Third, there is no evidence showing likelihood of resolution of
15 debts totaling more than $19,000 (SOR ¶ 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.v, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.kk, 1.ll, 1.qq, 1.rr,
1.vv, 1.ww, and 1.xx.).  Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that she had
resolved every debt.  See ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006).  Nevertheless, the
number and dollar amount of the unresolved debts, her inaction until she received the SOR, and her
lack of a good financial track record leave me unconvinced that she has made or will continue to
make a good faith effort to resolve all her debts.  I conclude MC 6 is not established.
Whole Person Analysis
In addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each
guideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,
11
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Regulation Appendix
8 at 132.  Some of these factors are addressed in the discussion of Guideline F above, but some merit
additional comment.
Applicant appears to be an exceptionally bright, articulate woman.  She enjoys her job and
has done it well.  She works hard to improve her educational level.  However, her failure to pay off
her numerous small debts even though she had a net monthly remainder of about $500 is
troublesome.  Her purchase of an expensive automobile at a time she was in financial distress did
not demonstrate financial acuity. 
Applicant’s resolution of many debts and skillful negotiation of several payment agreements
were steps in the right direction.  If she adheres to those payment agreements and addresses the
unpaid and unresolved debts, she may well qualify for a favorable determination in the future.  See
Directive ¶¶ E3.1.37, E3.1.38 (reconsideration after one year).  However, based on her record to date,
she has not mitigated the trustworthiness concern based on financial considerations.  Accordingly,
I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests
of national security to grant her a favorable trustworthiness determination.
