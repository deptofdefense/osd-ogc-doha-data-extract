SYNOPSIS
2
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was convicted in 1996 for
soliciting prostitution, and drove regularly for numerous years with a suspended or revoked driver’s
license resulting in several citations and convictions. He has accrued a number of unpaid debts.
Applicant did not intentionally falsify his security clearance application, or fail to cooperate with an
investigator, as alleged. Applicant mitigated the personal conduct concerns, but failed to mitigate
the financial considerations and criminal conduct concerns. Clearance is denied.
Pursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as1
amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On July 21, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)1
detailing the basis for its decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the
Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2006 and September 12, 2006, and
elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February
5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on February 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 9,
2007. Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. With the consent of the parties, the hearing
was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered seven exhibits that
were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, and admitted without objection. Applicant
testified, but did not offer any exhibits. The record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity
to submit additional material. Applicant did not submit any additional material.  DOHA received the2
hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.
RULINGS ON PROCEDURE
Department Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons. The motion was marked as
Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant was provided a copy of the motion in advance of the hearing.
Department Counsel moved to add two allegations, SOR ¶¶ 2.h and 2.i, as contained in HE I.
Applicant did not object. I granted the motion. Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 2.e, by
changing the words, “subparagraph 1.c.” in the third line to “subparagraph 1.a.” Applicant did not
object, and I granted the motion. Department Counsel further moved to amend SOR ¶ 3.b, by
inserting “2.h. and 2.i.,” after “2.e.” That motion was denied.  3
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant’s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant has several years of
college, but does not have a degree. He is single with one child, who lives with the child’s mother.4

Applicant admits he owes the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i. He attributes his
financial problems to being young and irresponsible.5
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is a judgment for $3,447 entered in 2000, for a delinquent student loan
for college tuition. Applicant received a garnishment summons to appear in August 2006. The
summons showed the judgment of $3,447, with a credit of $1,344, and additional interest and costs
of $2,007, for a balance owed of $4,110.  Applicant testified that his wages have been garnished and6
that he is paying $100 per month additional to the garnishment. Applicant estimates that the debt is
now less than $2,000. Applicant submitted no documentation to verify any payments.7
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b is a debt of $140 to a state agency for overpaid unemployment
benefits. Applicant testified that the state took money from his state income tax refund for this debt.
He believes that the debt is now $43. The most recent credit report shows the debt at $63.8
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a judgment of $7,265 entered in 2001, for a delinquent student loan for
college tuition. Applicant disputed the underlying debt because he stated he had a scholarship. He
stated he contacted the school but they referred him to their attorneys. He has no further information
on this debt.9
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is a debt of $513 to a bank for overdrafts. The debt is unpaid.
Applicant stated he is looking into a debt consolidation loan to address this and his other delinquent
debts.10
SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.g are three medical debts to unknown providers in the amounts of
$146, $155, and $230. SOR ¶ 1.h lists a judgment of $272, entered in 2004 on behalf of a hospital.
Applicant was in a car accident a few years ago in which he was a passenger. He states that all the
medical bills are related to that accident. Applicant states he recently received a settlement for the
accident and that any medical debts will be paid.  Based upon the evidence presented, it is unclear11
if any of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.g, were the underlying debt that resulted in the judgment
in SOR ¶ 1.h.

Applicant admitted to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, in the amount of $381 for a delinquent phone
bill. He has not paid this debt.  12
The credit report of March 6, 2007, lists a new delinquent debt of $153 for a cell phone. This
debt was initiated in about May 2006. Applicant admitted he still owed this debt.13
Applicant has never received financial counseling.  He has a plan is to pay his debts through14
a debt consolidation loan from his credit union, but has done little thus far to voluntarily pay his
debts.
Applicant was stopped by the police in July 1995, and cited for driving on a
revoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. Applicant admits that he was
driving on a suspended license. He does not remember whether he knew at the time that his license
had been suspended. The case was dismissed after Applicant provided proof to the court that his
license had been reinstated.15
Applicant was charged in September 1996, with soliciting prostitution, a misdemeanor, as
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b. He was found guilty, and paid approximately $315 in fines and court costs.16
Applicant was stopped by the police in February 1999, and cited for driving on a
revoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.c. The charge was Nolle Prosequi,
i.e., dismissed. Applicant admits that he was driving on a suspended license. He does not remember
whether he knew at the time that his license had been suspended. Applicant continued to drive after
this incident, knowing that his license was expired.17
Applicant was stopped by the police in July 2001, and cited for not having a driver’s license,
a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.d. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a $100 fine and $40
court costs.  18

person,” and the potential application of mitigating conditions.

Applicant was stopped by the police in April 2002, and cited for driving while suspended,
amended to not having a driver’s license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.h. He was found
guilty and ordered to pay a $25 fine and court costs of $164.19
Applicant was arrested on a capias warrant on about July 18, 2002, for failure to appear, as
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.e. A court may issue a capias should a person fail to appear in court pursuant
either to a summons or a subpoena. The capias requires the arrest of the accused and a subsequent
bail hearing. At the hearing triggered by the capias, the court may fine or jail the person for failing
to appear.  In this case the capias was dismissed.  There is insufficient evidence of any criminal20 21
responsibility on Applicant’s part, as relates to this warrant and arrest.
Applicant was stopped by the police in October 2002, and cited for driving on a revoked
license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.i. The charge was Nolle Prosequi.22
Applicant was stopped by the police on about August 12, 2004, and cited for driving on a
revoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f. A capias warrant was issued on
about September 23, 2004, for Applicant’s failure to appear, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.g. The warrant
was dismissed in February 2005, when Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to 90 days in jail,
suspended, a fine of $100 and court costs of $178.  I find Applicant criminally responsible for the23
misdemeanor offense of driving on a revoked/suspended license, but there is insufficient evidence
to find him criminally responsible for failure to appear.
Applicant admitted that he regularly drove from about 1999 to at least 2004, knowing that
his license was suspended or revoked. He testified that he has possessed a valid driver’s license for
about six to eight months, and that he has not driven with a suspended or revoked license for more
than a year.24
Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86 (SF-86), on August
3, 2004. Question 26 of the SF-86 asked, “In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged
with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic
fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.). For this item, report
information regardless of whether the record in your case has been ‘sealed’ or otherwise stricken
from the record. The single exception is to this requirement is for certain convictions under the

Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the
authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.” Applicant answered “NO.”  25
Applicant stated he answered “NO” because he misunderstood the question. Applicant
thought the question asked to list arrests for the offenses listed in modules 21 to 25. Applicant was
still not certain at the hearing if he should have listed his offenses.  The only time Applicant was26
truly arrested during the period in question was when he was picked up for the failure to appear
warrant. That warrant was dismissed. Applicant was not arrested for the driving related charges; he
was issued citations to appear in court. He had several traffic-related convictions during the period
in question, but none of them carried a fine of more than $150. After considering all the evidence,
and gauging Applicant’s credibility, I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SF-86 by
omitting the information contained in SOR ¶¶ 2.c through 2.e, 2.h, and 2.i. 
Question 37 of the SF-86 asked, “In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you
that have not been paid?” Applicant answered “YES,” and listed a 2001 judgment of $7,000. He did
not specifically list the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a.  Applicant was unsure why he did not list the27
additional judgment, but was adamant that he did not intentionally falsify the security clearance
application.  I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SF-86 by only listing one judgment28
in response to Question 37.
Applicant was scheduled to be interviewed during his background investigation in about late
February 2005, and then again in early March 2005. Applicant testified he had scheduling conflicts
and was unable to attend either scheduled interview. He attempted to contact the investigator about
the meetings but was unable to do so. No other evidence was introduced. He was interviewed by an
investigator in December 2005.29
POLICIES
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”  As Commander in Chief, the President has30
“the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person

Id.; Directive, ¶ E2.2.2.34

8
access to such information.”  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to31
grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  An applicant has the ultimate burden of32
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her
security clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant33
should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such
sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a34
determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a
clearance.  35
The Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions
(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and
impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the
whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in ¶ 6.3 and ¶ E2.2.1 of the
Directive.
Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and
discussed in the conclusions section below.
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.
I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or
unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.
Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)
E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts
9
that remain unsatisfied. I resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.g, in Applicant’s favor, as there is insufficient
evidence to show that these were not the underlying debts that resulted in the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.h.
I have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and
especially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It
was an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has
received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem
is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). 
Applicant has numerous delinquent debts accrued over a several year period. Most remain
unpaid. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. 
Applicant attributed his financial issues to youth and irresponsibility. Four of the debts were
medical debts, and related to a car accident in which Applicant was a passenger. The total of the four
debts is $803, a small figure compared to the total amount owed. Applicant is given some credit
under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 for his medical debts. The other debts did not result from conditions that
were largely beyond Applicant’s control.
Applicant has not received counseling for his financial problem, nor has he shown that his
financial problems are being resolved or under control. Applicant continues to accrue new delinquent
debt, as evidenced by the delinquent cell phone bill. While he states he has a plan to resolve his
problems, he has not implemented that plan. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 is not applicable.
Applicant has done almost nothing to voluntarily pay the debts in issue. Applicant’s wages
are being garnished for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant testified, but did not provide supporting
documentation, that he has paid several hundred dollars in additional payments toward this same
debt. Money has been taken out of Applicant’s state income tax refunds for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b.
Applicant’s actions do not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 does not apply.
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant’s judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness.
Applicant was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 1996. He has numerous citations and
convictions for driving on a suspended or revoked license. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying
Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or
multiple lesser offenses) both apply. 
I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct
Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC
E2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an isolated incident), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear
10
evidence of successful rehabilitation). Applicant drove regularly for a number of years with a
suspended or revoked driver’s license. He knew he was violating the law every time he did so. While
it has been more than two years since Applicant’s last conviction, his testimony was that he has
possessed a valid driver’s license for only about six to eight months, and that he has not driven with
a suspended or revoked license for more than a year. Under these circumstances, I conclude that no
mitigating condition applies.
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may
not properly safeguard classified information. 
Based on all the evidence, I have considered the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions
(PC DC) and concerns addressed in E2.A5.1.1.1 (Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required
security processing, including medical and psychological testing), E2.A5.1.1.2 (Refusal to complete
required security forms, releases, or provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of
investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a personnel
security or trustworthiness determination), and E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment
or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,
or award fiduciary responsibilities).
I do not find a refusal to cooperate with the investigators on Applicant’s part. He testified that
he had a scheduling conflict that caused him to miss the first two meetings, but that he
unsuccessfully attempted to contact the investigator to reschedule. No evidence was presented to
rebut this. I conclude SOR ¶ 3.a in Applicant’s favor. 
As discussed above, Applicant did not list all his criminal activity under Question 26 of his
SF-86. The criminal activity in question was an arrest pursuant to a warrant, which was then
dismissed, and traffic convictions. His traffic offenses were criminal, but carried fines of less than
$150. Applicant was still uncertain at the hearing if he was required to list the traffic-related
convictions. I do not find an intentional falsification. SOR ¶ 3.b is concluded in Applicant’s favor.
Applicant listed one judgment in response to Question 37, but did not list his other judgment.
After considering all the evidence, I find this was not an intentional attempt to conceal information.
I conclude SOR ¶ 3.a in Applicant’s favor.
Whole Person Analysis
The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in
reaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant’s case, I have considered the adjudicative process
factors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed
above. 
11
Applicant has a number of delinquent debts that remain unpaid. He recently incurred an
additional delinquent debt for a cell phone. Of particular concern is Applicant’s criminal activity.
His disregard for the law cannot be ignored. He drove on a suspended or revoked license for years,
without regard that he was breaking the law every time he did so. He continued to drive without a
valid license despite numerous citations and convictions. Applicant did not falsify his security
clearance application, or intentionally fail to cooperate with investigators. Applicant was simply
displaying the same lack of care and concern in the submission of the application and the interview
process, that he has shown in relation to his finances and his driving. 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence
in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct
concerns, but has not mitigated the security concerns based on his financial issues and criminal
conduct.
