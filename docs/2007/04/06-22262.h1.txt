Applicant and her husband incurred significant unpaid credit card debt in 1998 and 1999. Her
husband sustained disabling injuries in two separate automobile accidents, which impacted his ability
to obtain and maintain steady employment. In the last 10 years, Applicant always worked. At times,
only her income paid the bills. She continues to timely pay her bills, has paid several delinquent bills,
and initiated payment plans for all but one long delinquent debt barred from collection under state
law. She has mitigated the government’s security concerns regarding her finances. Clearance is
granted.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the
SOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department
of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or
revoked. On January 23, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. She
requested a hearing.
DOHA assigned this case to me on February 12, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on
March 5, 2007, which Applicant received 11 days before the hearing. At the hearing on March 20,
2007, Applicant waived her right to receive notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I
conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The government submitted six exhibits (GE) which were1
marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted five exhibits
(App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App Ex A-E without objection. Applicant and one
witness testified. I held the record open until April 10, 2007, for Applicant to submit further
documents, which she did. Applicant submitted ten additional documents, which were marked and
admitted as App Ex F through O without objection. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on
March 30, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F of the SOR.  Those admissions are2
incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due
consideration, I make the following findings of fact.

Applicant, a 41-year-old woman, holds an Associate of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Science
degree in business management. She works as a financial analyst for a Department of Defense
contractor. She seeks a clearance to increase her career opportunities with her employer. Her
supervisor describes her as a person of outstanding character and professional abilities. She always
gets the job done and is quick to learn. She received her latest performance evaluation in March
2007. Her supervisor rated her overall at Level 4, the second highest rating.3
Applicant enlisted in the United States Air Force reserves six years ago. She is a staff
sergeant whose duties involve personnel administration. She does not have a security clearance as
a reservist. Her Air Force Guard supervisor testified on her behalf. She described Applicant as her
number one right-hand woman. She stated that Applicant is professional and courteous. Applicant
provided excellent customer service and goes above and beyond in the performance of her duties.
Her most recent performance rating indicated that she needed little or no improvement in her
performance. Her minister, who is also a city councilman, described her as a person of good moral
character and a person who can be trusted.4
Applicant married in 1991. Her 19-year-old step-daughter is a college student. Her son is 10
years old. At the time of her marriage, Applicant’s husband worked as a machinist mate in the
United States Navy. In 1993, he suffered a back injury in an automobile accident, which resulted in
a 30% disability rating and a disability discharge from the Navy in December 1995. Applicant and
her husband accepted a lump sum severance payment of $35,000 at this time. Because she was
pregnant and they were unemployed, they moved in with her mother while her husband
unsuccessfully attempted to develop a new work career in her step-father’s construction business.
After paying taxes, they used the proceeds from the lump sum payment to pay bills and to invest in
her step-father’s business.5
Applicant and her husband retained a lawyer to represent them for the damages they sustained
as a result of the 1993 car accident. They eventually settled their case. Their lawyer received
approximately $33,000 in fees, and under its subrogation rights, the Navy recovered the cost of the
medical services it rendered to her husband. They received about $25,000, which they used for living
expenses and bills. A few years later, her husband sustained an injury to his shoulder in a one-car
automobile accident. They received a $3,500 settlement for his injuries.6
Applicant began her current employment in 1997. At the same time, her husband started
working as a contractor for the same employer. The employer furloughed her husband in 1998. Her
husband then obtained a manufacturing job, but because of his shoulder injury, he could not perform
the duties of the job. Likewise, because of his back injury, he cannot do heavy lifting jobs. For the
last ten years, Applicant has worked steadily, but her husband has been unable to obtain full-time

steady employment, which impacted their ability to pay bills. He started working as a caddy master
at a golf course in May 2006.7
A review of Appellant’s credit reports dated January 17, 2001, October 26, 2005, October
17, 2006, and the SOR shows 6 unpaid debts totaling $15,332.  The current status of these debts is8
as follows:
SOR ¶ TYPE OF DEBT (DATE) AMOUNT CURRENT STATUS
1.b Gasoline credit card (1986) $   800.00 Unpaid (Barred by the statue
of limitations)
1.c Credit card (1999) $9,939.00 Payment plan
1.d Medical bill (2000) $   165.00 Paid
1.e Medical bill (2000) $   135.00 Paid
1.f` Credit card (2002) $3,603.57 Payment plan
1.g Medical bill (2004) $   690.00 Payment plan
Applicant used the two delinquent credit cards to pay monthly living expenses until 1998.
She stopped paying these bills when her husband was unemployed in 1998. She paid the two small
delinquent medical bills in July and August 2006.  She recently made arrangements to make monthly9
payments on three of her four remaining delinquent debts. She will pay $100 a month on her largest
credit card debt, $100 a month on the one remaining medical bill, and $75 a month on the remaining
credit card debt. She obtained a gasoline credit card 20 years ago. She timely paid the card and paid
the bill in full. Not long after her marriage, she added her mother to this credit card account as an
authorized user. The credit card company gave her mother a separate card and mailed the monthly
bills to her mother, who paid the bills for awhile, then stopped paying the bill. Her mother never
advised her that the bill had not been paid. In her efforts to resolve this debt, she learned that the
creditor is no longer in business. The new owner of the company cannot locate an account in her
name. With the exception of the unpaid medical bill, all the accounts listed in the SOR were time
barred from collection under state law.10
Applicant earns approximately $3,461 a month in gross salary, including her recent merit pay
increase, with a net monthly pay of approximately $2,436. From her reserve duty, she receives
App Ex G (Copies of Applicant’s last three paycheck statements); App Ex H (Copies of Applicant’s military11
pay statements for January, February and March 2007).

approximately $257 a month in net pay. Her total net monthly income is approximately $2,693.  Her11
husband anticipates that he will earn approximately $25,000 this year from his employment. Because
his work is directly related to good golfing weather, his monthly earnings fluctuate. She anticipates
his income will increase as the weather for golf improves. In March 2007, her husband contributed
$562 before taxes to the household income and will contribute approximately $1,300 before taxes
in April 2007. Her husband occasionally performs side jobs for which he receives payments. The
amount of his earnings is unknown.12
Applicant’s monthly expenses include a mortgage payment of $1400, two car payments
totaling $1,088, utilities of $242, gasoline of $300, car insurance of $321, food of $125,
miscellaneous expenses of $75 and credit card payments of approximately $200 for total monthly
expenses of $3,751. Her credit reports reflect that she timely pays her existing credit cards and other
debts.  In addition, Applicant will resume paying her education loan in June 2007. She estimates13
this payment at $115.  Under the payment agreements she established, Applicant pays $275 a month14
on her delinquent debts for total additional expenses of almost $400 a month.
The SOR alleges that the Air Force denied Applicant a security clearance based on financial
considerations. She admits that she does not have a clearance, but denies that it was for financial
reasons. She met with an investigator and signed a statement on May 14, 2001 acknowledging the
debts identified in allegations 1.c, 1.f and 1.g. She also stated that her husband was not working and
that she was the sole provider for the family and that she would start paying the debts when her
husband began working full-time. She had no further contact with anyone from the Air Force until
several years later, when her supervisor requested her to sign a letter acknowledging the denial of
her clearance for non-compliance. She believes that the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility may
have sent her a letter requesting information similar to that which has been requested for this
application. She never received the letter.  The government has not provided any documentation15
which sets forth the reasons for the denial of her clearance by the Air Force, or establishes that she
was properly served with the documents related to her prior denial.
POLICIES
The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating
conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the
revised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the
Directive, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) ¶ 2(a)(1)-(9).16

complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in
reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular
condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security
clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-
person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,
and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and
recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.16
The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government17
has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a18
preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the19
applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable20
clearance decision.21
No one has a right to a security clearance,  and “the clearly consistent standard indicates that22
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Any reasonable23
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved
in favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically24
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” The decision to deny an
individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and
patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict25
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.

CONCLUSIONS
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate
adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,
all of which can raise questions about an individuals’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG ¶ 18.) Applicant has significant unpaid old debt, which
occurred when her husband was unemployed. Based on the evidence of record, DC ¶ 19 (a) inability
… to satisfy debts and DC ¶ 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.
Applicant’s debt problems arose because of several events in the past. Her husband suffered
a significant injury in a car accident which led to his discharge from the Navy and an inability to
work in his chosen career. During the 11 years subsequent to his discharged, her husband has not
worked steadily. His inability to find steady full-time employment impacted their ability to pay
monthly living expenses. For awhile, they financed normal living expenses with credit cards.
However, they stopped paying two credit card debts when he lost his job in 1998. Since this time,
his employment has not been steady and reliable. Thus, their inability to resolve these debts
continued. She denied, until recently, any knowledge of the debt alleged in paragraph 1.b of the
SOR. Many years ago, she added her mother to this account as an authorized user. The creditor
provided her mother was a separate credit car and mailed the bills to her mother. Her mother,
however, never told her about this unpaid debt. MC ¶ 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the
financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual
acted responsibly under the circumstances applies because of her husband’s unemployment and her
mother’s withholding of information on the payment of a credit card debt. 
Applicant has not retained the services of a financial counselor. Thus, MC ¶ 20 (c) the person
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the
problem is being resolved or is under control does not apply. 
Applicant paid the two smallest debts listed in the SOR about nine months ago. Three months
ago, she verbally advised the creditors for the two largest delinquent s debts and the one remaining
medical bill that she would begin payments on these debts. In compliance with her promise, she
began monthly payments on these time barred debts in January 2007. She has attempted to locate the
creditor for her very oldest debt. Because of the age of this debt and the sale of the creditor company,
she has been unable to develop a payment plan for this debt, which cannot be collected under state
law. MC ¶ 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts applies.
Whole Person Analysis
See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC26
6 for debts being resolved through garnishment).

Protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are
not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the
objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person’s
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I
have considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant’s risk and vulnerability in
protecting our national interests. 
Under the 3-year State’s statute of limitations, which applies to 5 of her 6 unpaid SOR debts,
the creditors were time barred from collecting these debts.  The State Court of Appeals succinctly26
explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they
stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and
stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes
of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.
Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that
after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred
claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their
rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted). Thus, the debt alleged in 1.b is time barred from collection. However,
in light of Applicant’s recent payments on the debts alleged in allegations 1.c, 1.f and 1.g, the 3-year
period from which a creditor can seek collection through legal process begins again. State Code ¶
15-3-120. 
Applicant and her husband used his severance payment to pay existing debts in 1996 and to
pay for living expenses. They lived with her mother to reduce expenses while they started to rebuild
their work careers after his injury and discharge from the Navy. By 1997, both were working. In
1998, her husband lost his job, and although he found new work, his shoulder injury along with his
back injury ended his ability to work at this job or other jobs requiring heavy physical labor. During
this time they got behind in their bills. Her husband has worked off and on over the last 10 years.
While she has been able to keep current on their normal living expenses, she could not repay their
old debt. Her regular bills are current. 
With the exception of the $690 medical bill, the debts listed in the SOR could not be
collected because the creditor had been barred by the state statute of limitations from legally
collecting this debt. However, her agreement to pay these debts removes the statute of limitations
for the creditor. By initiating payments on this debt, Applicant has acted responsibly.
Applicant’s current expenses exceed her monthly bills by a significant amount each month.
While the credit reports indicate that she is current on her monthly payments, a concern arises about
how she continues to pay her monthly obligations, that she may be over extended, and thus, unable
to meet the commitments she has made. Her husband’s monthly income will improve during the golf
9
season, which will lessen the financial stress during that period of time, and is a factor to consider.
His supplement income from odd jobs must also be considered in assessing her overall financial
situation. She and her husband are living right on the edge within their means.
Her employer praises her work skills and work ethic. Her latest performance appraises gives
her the second highest employee rating. Likewise, she is highly respected for her work in the Air
Force reserves. In reviewing all the facts of this case, there is little potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation or duress. I have weighed the applicable mitigating factors, her responsible conduct in
paying old debt, and her current financial situation. Since she stopped her two credit card payments
in 1998 or 1999, she has not incurred any large, unpaid debt. Her unpaid medical expense debts
totaled less than $1,000, and is now around $500. Despite the periodic loss of her husband’s income,
she managed to continue to regularly pay her bills. Although she continues to juggle her finances,
she remains timely on her debt payments. She has mitigated the government’s security concerns.
Accordingly, Guideline F is found in favor of Applicant.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
