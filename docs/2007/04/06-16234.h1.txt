$10,225. Most of the accounts were delinquent medical bills.  She recently paid off each debt from
the funds received from a settlement related to an accident involving her husband. Her good faith

STATEMENT OF CASE
On January 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence1
the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,
of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the
Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.
In an undated sworn statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to
have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the
government’s file of relevant material (FORM) on February 26, 2007. The FORM was mailed to
Applicant on February 28, 2007, and received on March 2, 2007. Applicant was afforded an
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant
responded on March 9, 2007. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007. 
PROCEDURAL ISSUES
The case file did not indicate Applicant received a copy of the revised AG issued on
December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. On
March 23, 2007, an Order was sent to Department Counsel. Department Counsel was ordered to
contact Applicant to inquire as to whether the revised Adjudicative Guidelines were sent to
Applicant.  If not, the order states Department Counsel will send Applicant a copy of the Revised
AGs and give her 30 days to review and respond to the revised AGs. On April 2, 2007, Department
Counsel spoke with Applicant and she confirmed on April 3, 2007, she received a copy of the
revised Adjudicative Guidelines.

 Applicant has severe chronic asthma.  She is hospitalized approximately once a year due to
her condition.   She incurred a lot of the medical bills when she did not have medical insurance,7
especially when she was a full-time student. Even when she had insurance, co-payments were a
financial burden to her family expenses.  In response to interrogatories, dated November 30, 2006,8
Applicant indicated her husband was injured in a motorcycle accident in August 2006.  He was
unable to work indefinitely  resulting in Applicant being the sole provider for the family. She stated
that she would pay the debts as soon as she had the money.9
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that she resolved all of the delinquent
accounts in the SOR.  She was able to pay off the debts with a cash settlement her husband received10
related to his motorcycle accident.   The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was paid on February 7, 2007.11 12

The President has “the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position …
that will give that person access to such information.”  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding21
Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and
procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. 
To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines
contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on
December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,
sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating
conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's
means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,
lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can
raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect
classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern
as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be
explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.22
Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and
discussed in the conclusions below.
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.”   An administrative23
judge must apply the “whole person concept,” and consider and carefully weigh the available,
reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following
factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)
the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is
voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)
the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and
(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  24
Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR
that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified

information.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,25
extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.26
“Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of the national security.”  27
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the
government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual
a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a
clearance.
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government
has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. She has encountered financial
problems since she was a college student.  She was only recently able to resolve her delinquent
accounts as a result of monies received from a settlement related to her husband's motorcycle
accident. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's
case. 
The financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that Financial Considerations
Mitigating Conditon (FC MC) 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected
medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), applies, in part.  The majority of Applicant's
delinquent accounts are medical bills. Her chronic asthma contributed to her financial burdens,
especially when she had no health insurance.  Her husband's motorcycle accident in August 2006,
prevented him from working.  The record is not clear as to whether he is currently unable to work.
It is also not clear how much income he brought into the household.  Regardless, his inability to work
adversely affected Applicant's ability to resolve her delinquent accounts.  However, I also note that
Applicant purchased a time share in 2003.  This is a frivolous expense and indicates poor judgment28
on Applicant's part.  The money would have been better spent towards her delinquent accounts. For
this reason, I give FC MC 20(b) less weight.
7
FC MC 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there
are clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control) applies.  Applicant resolved all
of the delinquent accounts in the SOR.  Her financial problems appear to be under control. There is
nothing in the file indicating that she received financial counseling. It is strongly recommended
Applicant attend financial counseling to learn how to budget her expenses in order to prevent her from
having financial problems in the future.  
Although the resolution of Applicant's debts were at the last minute, she resolved her accounts
when she and her husband received the monetary settlement. FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  
I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the “whole person” concept in
evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has
mitigated the security concerns raised by the financial considerations concern. Therefore, I am
persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.
