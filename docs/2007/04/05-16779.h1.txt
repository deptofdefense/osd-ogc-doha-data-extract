SYNOPSIS
Applicant's delay in filing his federal tax returns and developing a plan to pay $40,000 in
delinquent federal tax debts established security concerns under both financial considerations and
personal conduct.  Even after receiving the Statement of Reasons (SOR), he failed to begin a good-
faith effort to resolve his tax debts with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Notably, he has had a
stable and well-paying job in the private sector since 1995.  While he states an intent to resolve the
tax debts, he has established no formal plan to do so.  Applicant did mitigate concerns over his other
debts which he paid and established he had no intent to falsify his security questionnaires. Overall,
concerns over financial issues and personal conduct persist.  Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
to the Applicant on June 12, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not make
the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances1
(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations
in an Answer notarized on August 18, 2006; he admitted all allegations with explanation except for
a denial of allegations 2.b iii., 2.b. iv.,  and 2.c.  He requested a hearing.
Procedural Issue
After Department Counsel stated the case was ready to proceed on November 2, 2006, the
case was assigned to me on November 7, 2006.  On November 14, 2006, DOHA issued a Notice of
Hearing and set this case to be heard on December 4, 2006, in a city near where Applicant works.
However, Applicant did not receive the Notice until November 21, 2006;.  He requested the hearing
be re-scheduled as he did not get the 15 days advance notice required by the Directive at E3.1.8.  On
November 30, 2006, I issued an Order cancelling the first date and re-schedule his hearing for Friday
January 5, 2007.  On November 30, 2006, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing cancelling the first date
and on December 1, 2006, issued a Notice of Hearing  to re-set this case to be heard on January 5,2
2007, in a city near where Applicant works.  
Department Counsel presented seven exhibits (Exhibits 1-7) which were admitted into
evidence without objection.  (TR 12-15)  Applicant testified and offered two exhibits (Exhibits A-B).
To allow Applicant to submit additional documents, I agreed to leave the record open until January
26, 2007.  Department Counsel had seven days to submit his comments.  (TR 84)  After Applicant
       In his response Department Counsel noted that Exhibit D indicated that the accountant had prepared tax3
returns for Applicant but did not confirm that they were filed with the IRS.  Applicant did not provide copies
of either his federal or state returns for the 1998-2005 period over which the SOR raised security concerns.
3
submitted his Exhibits C-G, Department Counsel responded  on January 30, 2007 and offered no3
objection to the documents.   All Applicant’s exhibits were admitted into evidence and the record
closed on January 30, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on January 12, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant, 51 years old, has been employed by a defense contractor as a military analyst in
State #1 since March 1995.  In this job he is deployed all over the world.  (Exhibit 1; TR 35-36) 
He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 17, 2003. Previously, he was
employed from September 1993 to March 1995 with another defense contractor on the same
contract.   He served in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1993 and had a Secret security clearance.  He
was granted a Defense Department Secret security clearance in August 1992 which he maintains.
(Exhibit 1; TR 43)
Applicant studied at a community college in 2001, but received no degree.  (Exhibit 1; TR
42)  Applicant married his first wife in 1973 and divorced in 1981; they had two children and
Applicant got custody.  He married his second wife in 1982; he was divorced in 1985 and paid her
alimony of $1,000 per month.  He married his current and third wife in August 1985; she had two
children; and they had two children together.  (Exhibits 1, 5; TR 31-32; 44-45; 65) Applicant has six
children.  He is currently supporting one daughter and her three children and has been since January
2005.  (Exhibit 5; TR 28-29; 34; 45-46)
Finances and Personal Conduct
In 1993 Applicant was in the Army and supported his family on $29,000 a year.  (TR 28)
Applicant now makes approximately $80,000 from his job and his military retirement.  His wife is
not currently employed.  (TR 29)
Applicant did not file federal income tax returns from 1990 through 1996 nor did he file from
1998 through at least 2004.  He never asked for an extension even though he knew he had a legal
responsibility to file his taxes.  (SOR 2.b.)  At his hearing, he could offer no explanation as to why
he had not filed these federal returns. He was deployed in 1991 and lived in tents for six to seven
months which is why he did not file that year.  (TR 20-22; 47-48; 57)  He declared, “Once I got into
that hole, I didn’t think I was going to get out.” He now believes he can resolve these tax debts in
two or three years.  (TR 35; 49-50; 75) He did contact the IRS in 1997 and again in 2000 or 2001.
Since the garnishments ended in 2003, he has not contacted the IRS again.  (TR 58)  
In January 2007 he wrote a letter to IRS to try to obtain copies of his correspondence from
       The SOR does not allege any security concern over his unfiled and unpaid state taxes; no SOR4
amendment was offered to add that as a concern.
4
1997 and in 2002 or 2003; however, he did not submit any response from IRS.  (Exhibit F)
Applicant hired a law firm in November 2005 to handle his tax issues, but they required him
to file all his taxes before they would act to arrange a payment plan with the IRS.  Consequently, he
hired an accounting firm in December 2006 to file his taxes. In January 2007 he testified he believed
he owed $50,000 to the IRS for tax years 1998 to 2005.  He could not file for tax years beyond a five
limit; the time for him to file with IRS for 1990 to 1995 has expired.  He last filed a tax return either
in 1996 or 1997. He admitted he also has not filed his state taxes since 1997 and estimated he owed
$3,000 to the state.  His accounting  firm indicated in January 2007 that they had prepared the tax
returns for years 1998 through and including 2005. The firm reported Applicant and his wife owe
$39,785 in federal taxes and $2,849 for state taxes  in the state where he lives and $763 for state4
taxes in another state.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4; TR 22-23; 55-63; Exhibit D)
Applicant signed his 2003 SF 86 and certified that the statements on the form were true and
correct.  On his SF 86 Applicant was asked in Question 34 if he had any wage garnishments; he
disclosed that the IRS had garnished his wages in July 2001 in the amount of $53,000; he explained
that was an estimate.  In fact, he owed $47,000.  However, in response to Question 36 on any tax
lien, he did not document that he had received a tax lien from the IRS in May 2002.  (SOR 2.c.)
(Exhibit 1; TR 33-34)  In his answer he claimed he did not know he had a tax lien; at the hearing he
said he was never given any written notice of the lien.  (Answer; TR 23-24, 33-34)  Investigation
disclosed adverse credit issues in credit reports.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4)
SOR 1.a.. Applicant admitted his debt to Creditor #1, the IRS, but stated in August
2006 that he planned to file his back taxes and to pay his tax debt.  He stated
he had paid over $45,000 for taxes through the year 1997, but he did not
provide documentation showing he had paid that amount.  He admitted owing
for tax years 1998 to 2005.   (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 4; TR 54-55)
SOR 1.b. Applicant admitted the IRS filed a tax lien against him in May 2002 for non-
payment of federal tax from 1990 to1995.  (Answer)
SOR 1.c. Applicant admitted the IRS filed a tax lien against him in May 2002 for
$2,430 for non-payment of federal taxes for 1996.  Those taxes were paid in
full and tax lien was released in August 2003.  Applicant did not learn about
the lien until the security investigator came to talk with him in November
2004 or 2005 and showed him a credit report.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 4; TR 52-
55)
SOR 1.d. Applicant’s wages were garnished in 2001 to  pay for delinquent federal
income taxes.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4)  Applicant paid some of his back
taxes through this wage garnishment for two years; but his wages are no
longer being garnished.  (TR 25, 37; 51-52) 
5
SOR 1.e. In October 2005 Applicant paid his debt to Creditor #2, for $588 for a credit
card he applied for and never used.  He has another credit card with this
creditor that he keeps current.  (Answer; TR 26-27; 63-64)
Earlier, after he returned from an overseas assignment, Applicant completed his 1992
National Agency Questionnaire (DD Form 398-2).  In response to Question 19e. he did not reveal
that he had any significant delinquent debts even though he had debts of $4,000 to four creditors. At
that time he did not have access his credit report before he answered the questions; he did not
intentionally falsify his answer.  While he was married to Wife #2, she incurred a lot of debts that
she did not disclose to him.  That behavior led to their divorce.  (SOR 2.b.) (Exhibits 4, 7; TR 41-42;
73-74)  He disputed the first debt of $600 as not his debt as he was not able to get his car refinanced
after his divorce and returned the car to his wife; he was not responsible for her actions.  (Exhibit
7; TR 30) (SOR 2.b.i.) 
With respect to his current financial situation, Applicant stated he had six credit cards which
he keeps current.  His only other debt is for his mortgage.  His house is worth $167,000; and he owes
$124,000.  He has owned the home since 1994.  He does expend monies on home remodeling. While
he had credit problems in the 2000 to 2001 period he resolved his debts with those creditors. (TR
27-28, 38; 41; 70-71) He explained that the late medical bills are due to the method TRICARE uses
to pay medical bills.  (TR 68) He has been responsible for paying the bills in the household since
1994.  His wife is not aware of the extent of the tax issues.  (TR 66-67)  His current budget reflects
monthly income of $8,300, monthly expenses of $2,779, and discretionary expenses of $909.  He
makes a $164 investment deposit to his 401K 403B accounts.  His monthly remainder is $4,516.
(Exhibit G)
Applicant believes he makes an important contribution through his work.  (TR 38-39)  His
performance evaluation for 2006, signed in January 2007, documents that overall he meets job
requirements.  With respect to individual job elements, Applicant meets job requirements  in job
knowledge, quality and quantity of work, and company values. Applicant exceeds job requirements
in working relationships and communication skills as well as in time management and initiative.
(Exhibit E)
References
Applicant’s supervisor for five years reported that he is an “outstanding employee in every
respect.”  He knows that Applicant has made a mistake, but he has confidence in him as a trainer and
believes this “mistake” should not be compounded by denying him a security clearance.  Applicant
has been meticulous in complying with security requirements.  He does not believe Applicant would
disclose secrets even under stress or duress. (Exhibit C)
An individual who is a GS-14 deputy and has worked with Applicant since 1992 views
Applicant as a professional.  He has “total trust” in Applicant as he “consistently demonstrates all
of the traits that we stress in the Army: honesty; truthfulness, candor and integrity.”  He recommends
him without reservation be allowed access to classified information. (Exhibit B)
An individual who is a GS-15 and has worked with Applicant for 14 years as a co-worker

POLICIES
Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an
individual’s security eligibility: conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or
continue an individual's access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given
adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole
in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:
Guideline F - Financial Considerations 
The Concern:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in
illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from
financially profitable criminal acts.
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
The Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack
of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.
The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate
that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s access to
classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding
that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and
conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.
CONCLUSIONS
Financial Considerations
The Government established disqualifying conditions  that could raise a security concern and5
statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy
debts; E2.A6.1.2.4.  Unexplained affluence; E2.A6.1.2.5.  Financial problems that are linked to gambling,
drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.
       Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A6.1.3.1.  The behavior was not recent;6
E2.A6.1.3.2.  It was an isolated incident;  E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);  E2.A6.1.3.4.  The person has received or is receiving
counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under
control;  E2.A6.1.3.5.  The affluence resulted from a legal source; and E2.A6.1.3.6.  The individual initiated
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
7
may be disqualifying including Applicant’s (1) history of financial problems and his (3) inability or
unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts.  Applicant resolved his dated debts, but he has been very
slow to address his responsibility to file and pay his federal taxes for a number of years.  Substantial
unresolved issues persist with the IRS.  He is not in communication with the IRS as to how to
resolve his back taxes.  He explained his tax lawyers would not address the issue until he had filed
all his tax returns. He retained an accountant to do so in January 2007; she confirmed that she had
prepared the returns for 1998 to 2005, but did not confirm Applicant had filed them.  
Consequently, Applicant does not fulfill  mitigating  conditions.  While he has developed a6
plan and hired a tax lawyer in November 2005, he did not hire an accountant until January 2007 to
prepare his returns.  While he has to travel for his job, he is responsible for managing the bills.  His
substantial take home pay is approximately $8,300 per month and his monthly remainder is $4,500
per month.  Yet, the long-standing delinquent tax debts which he acknowledged in 2003 in his SF86
have persisted without any plan for a resolution.  Consequently, I conclude that under MC 2, the
debts were not isolated as he developed multiple delinquent tax debts.  
Under MC 3, there initially were conditions that resulted in his not filing his IRS return in
1991 when he was deployed and living in a tent.  However, that defense cannot obscure the many
years of subsequent inaction when he failed to file returns.  Further, under MC 4, Applicant delayed
seeking financial counseling for the tax problems.  He waited until January 2007 to hire an
accountant to prepare his taxes and gave no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or
is under control with the IRS. Under MC 6, an individual is expected to initiate a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  To mitigate Applicant does not have to have
erased every tax debt, but he has to present a plan.  Here Applicant has demonstrated he is financially
responsible in every other way, but he was failed to follow through and demonstrate a plan to resolve
these federal tax debts of approximately $40,000. Thus, Applicant has failed to mitigate these
financial concerns as he has provided insufficient evidence that he has a systematic plan to resolve
the federal tax debts alleged in SOR 1.a.  Through wage garnishment he has paid the other taxes and
another debt alleged in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.  
“Whole Person” Analysis 
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the
general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix
8.  It is troublesome that Applicant cannot explain his failure to file and to resolve his federal tax
       Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  E2.A5.1.2.2.7
The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; E2.A5.1.2.5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations,
including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency; 
8
debt when he otherwise provided evidence of positive behavior on the job and improved financial
circumstances in his personal handling of other matters.  For example, he has otherwise no new
delinquent, unpaid debt. Thus, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low
especially in light of the total confidence his supervisors and overseers express in his competence
and integrity.   Applicant has greater awareness of financial responsibilities in areas except for his
failure to take responsibility to file and pay his back federal taxes.  He has stable employment since
1995 in a company where he is valued.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low.
He has had a clearance for a number of years, both in military service and in his work for defense
contractors.  However, I find unexplainable his failure to use his substantial financial resources to
develop a plan to resolve these long-standing delinquent tax debts.
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and
circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated some of his debts and
paid some of his past tax debts, but otherwise failed to mitigate the concerns pertaining to his
remaining federal financial tax obligations.  Substantial evidence supports a conclusion that
Applicant is not yet eligible  to retain his security clearance based on pertinent factors under the
Adjudicative Process.  Even after receiving the June 2006 SOR, he failed to set in motion a good-
faith effort to resolve his tax debts and develop a plan with the IRS despite his stable and well-paying
job.  In the light of his history of paying past taxes by wage garnishment, he has not mitigated these
security concerns simply by a stated intent to file his taxes and to resolve the tax debts without
having established a formal plan. 
Thus, I rule against Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1 as he failed to mitigate the allegations
in SOR subparagraphs1.a., but has mitigated allegations in subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d, and 1.e.  
Personal Conduct
The government provided evidence to support security concerns  over personal conduct in7
his failure to file his federal income tax returns from 1990 through 1996 and from 1998 through
2004.  On the other hand, with respect to his omissions on his two security forms regarding financial
questions, I conclude the government did not establish this concern as Applicant demonstrated he
had no intent to falsify, so his omissions were not deliberate.  Notably, Applicant disclosed
significant adverse information regarding his finances in his 2003 SF 86 as he revealed $53,000 in
tax debts in response to question 34. While he admitted he failed to disclose a tax lien in response
to question 36, he credibly denied an intent to deceive or falsify.  His lack of intent to hide or deceive
the government about his financial issues is established by his having revealed the most significant
of his debts, his federal tax delinquencies. I find him similarly credible with respect to the financial
issues he failed to document on his 1992 security form. 
9
As discussed above under financial considerations, Applicant failed to provide sufficient
evidence to mitigate concerns over his failure to file his federal tax returns as he understand he had
a legal duty to do so.  While he had a credible explanation for failing to file for one year, he could
not himself explain his failure to file in subsequent years. 
“Whole Person” Analysis 
In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the
general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix
8.  While Applicant’s did not initially detail all of his financial problems, he has a long history of
responsible conduct and has had a clearance for a number of years, both in military service and in
his  defense contractor work.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.
However, the history of other responsible conduct makes his failure to take responsibility for his
taxes even more inexplicable.
Considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against
Applicant under SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraph 2.a., but for Applicant on subparagraph 2.b. and
2.c..
