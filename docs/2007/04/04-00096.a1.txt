APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
Ray T. Blank, Jr., Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Kenneth R. Rhoad, Esq.
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance. On February 24, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),
Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 31,
2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant’s request for a
The Judge’s favorable decision under Guideline F is not at issue on appeal1
The Judge also found that the IRS placed a tax lien against Applicant in 1995 for tax years 1988, 1990, and2
1993.

security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that
Applicant had intentionally falsified his security clearance application and whether the Judge’s
unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.   We affirm the decision of the Judge.1
Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge’s Factual Findings
A.  Facts
The Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to this appeal:  In 2002, Applicant
filled out his security clearance application.  Question 36 of the application required him to state
whether, within the previous seven years (which dated back to October 10, 1995) he had had a lien
placed against him for failure to pay taxes or for other debts.  Applicant answered this question “no.”
Question 38 required him to state whether he had any debts over 180 days delinquent.  Applicant
stated only that he had a $1600 credit card debt.  Question 39 required Applicant to state whether
he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  Applicant  answered the question “no.”
In answering these questions, Applicant did not state that the Internal Revenue Service had
placed a lien against him in 1998 for failure to pay taxes in tax years 1991, 1992, and 1996.2
Applicant explained to the investigator that he believed that he only had to list debts that arose within
the seven year window, rather than debts that were ongoing.  In responding to interrogatories,
Applicant attributed his false answer under question 36 to poor memory.  At the hearing, he initially
stated that he was unaware of the 1998 tax lien, although he subsequently admitted that his employer
told him about it.  Decision at 4.
B.  Discussion
The Appeal Board’s review of the Judge’s finding of facts is limited to determining if they
are supported by substantial evidence—such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept
as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.” Directive
¶ E3.1.32.1. “This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing
two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s findings
from being supported by substantial evidence.” Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607,
620-21, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)). In evaluating the Judge’s finding, we give
deference to the Judge’s credibility determinations. Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1. 
We have examined the challenged findings of fact in light of the record evidence.  It is clear,
and Applicant does not now deny, that he answered the questions at issue incorrectly.  The Judge
noted Applicant’s inconsistent statements as to his awareness of the 1998 tax lien.  He also took into
account the gravity and the ongoing nature of Applicant’s problems with the IRS as establishing that
he could not reasonably have believed that his answers to question 38 and 39 were truthful.

Additionally, the Judge was in a position to observe Applicant’s demeanor and assign it appropriate
weight in evaluating the case.  See Directive  ¶    E3.1.32.1.  (“[T]he Appeal Board shall give
deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge. . .”).  Accordingly, we
conclude that the Judge’s findings of deliberate falsification are supported by substantial record
evidence. 
Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge’s Ultimate Conclusions
A Judge is required to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation
for” the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”
Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43
(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The
Appeal Board may reverse the Judge’s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive ¶ E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this
standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge. We review matters
of law de novo.
There is no right to a security clearance.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,
528 (1988).  Once the government raises security concerns under the Directive, the burden of
persuasion shifts to the applicant to establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for
him to receive a clearance.  See Directive ¶¶  E3.1.13; E3.1.14; EO 10865 (Feb. 20, 1960)(as
amended).   In the instant case, the Judge properly concluded that Applicant’s conduct, as reflected
in the record, raised security concerns under Guideline E, specifically Personal Conduct
Disqualifying Condition (PCDC) 2.   He also properly concluded that the evidence establishes3
concerns under Guideline J.   The Judge stated that Applicant’s explanations for his false answers4
contain “too many inconsistencies,” undermining his credibility and impairing his effort to meet his
burden of persuasion.  After considering Applicant’s arguments on appeal, we find no error in the
Judge’s decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide
whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. An applicant's
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different
interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or
reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case No.
