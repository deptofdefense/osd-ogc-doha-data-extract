STATEMENT OF THE CASE
On November 13, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On August 7, 2006, the Defense Office of1    
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised.  The
SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral
to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September
14, 2006, and elected to have a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on December 20, 2006.  I convened
a hearing on January 23, 2007.  The government offered thirteen  exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-13.  Applicant offered one exhibit, marked as Exhibit A.  DOHA
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a. through
1.g.  These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough
review of the evidence, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following  findings of fact:
Applicant is a 31-year-old supervisor employed by a federal contractor.   He is single and has2
his two-year-old child living with him.   He is a high school graduate with three years of college3
credits.   He is an eight-year veteran of the United States Marine Corps, having served from August4
1993 to August 2001.   He was honorably discharged with the rank of Lance Corporal (pay grade E-5
3), and he held a secret security clearance during his Marine Corps service.  6
As of July 25, 2006, Applicant owed the following debts:7
1.a. $347 collection account placed February 2001;8
1.b. $4,596 credit union charged off in April 2003;9

1.c. $395 collection account placed in June 2003;10
1.d. $463 credit union charged off in January 2005;11
1.e. $6,412 credit union charged off in November 2004;12
1.f. $153 collection account placed in March 2001;  and13
1.g. $372 collection account placed in June 1999.  14
Applicant accumulated seven unpaid debts totaling about $12,638.  Two debts totaling
$11,000 were charged off in April 2003 and November 2004.  The remaining five  debts, all less than
$500,  were placed for collection between June 1999 and January 2005.   15
After his discharge from the Marine Corps, Applicant had inconsistent employment.  He did
contract work as an electrical helper working for an uncle.  He also was attending college.  In April
2002, he was employed by a federal credit union.  He left that employment in August 2003, and
commenced employment with his present employer in March 2004.16
While in college, Applicant took out approximately $56,000 in student loans, with repayment
deferred while in school.  He intends to attend school indefinitely to postpone repayment as long as
possible.   in the meantime, he purchased a used car requiring payments of $600 per month for the17
next six years.18
On December 5, 2006, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 petition in bankruptcy.   At the time of19
this hearing, the bankruptcy discharge hearing had not been scheduled.  Assuming that the

Guidelines ¶ 2. 22
Guidelines ¶ 2(c).23
Guidelines ¶ 2(b).24

bankruptcy petition is upheld, the debts listed in the SOR would be discharged.  The student loan
debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.20
Prior to filing bankruptcy, Applicant had not sought any financial counseling.  The
bankruptcy court required him to attend two financial management courses, which he completed.
He had not prepared a budget.21
POLICIES
In an evaluation of an applicant’s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider
the “Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information”
(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each Guidelines, the Guidelines are
divided into Disqualifying Conditions and Mitigating Conditions, which are used to determine an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.   An administrative judge’s over-22
arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process
is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole person concept,” an
administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and
present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.23
Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors
listed at Guidelines ¶ 2(a): “(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.”
Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision
in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being
considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”   In24
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based
“Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a
25
conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing
two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge’s] finding from being supported by substantial
evidence.”  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a
scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).th
See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence26  
as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant’s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent
provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive ¶
E3.1.15.”  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). 
Executive Order 10865, § 7. 27

on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on
mere speculation or conjecture.
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial evidence.”   The25
Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,
in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue an applicant’s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence
and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive ¶ E3.1.15 provides, “The applicant is responsible for
presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by
applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion
as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition
never shifts to the Government.26
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the
government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the Guidelines
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain
degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
 
The scope of an administrative judge’s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should
be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied
determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  27
CONCLUSIONS
The government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting
financial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an
Directive ¶ E.2.2.1.28
7
(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has
a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on numerous
accounts, and he has made no payments on his student loans.  
Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The
Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The
conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation).  Applicant’s delinquent debts started accumulating after his discharge from the Marine
Corps, due to spotty employment.  He had periods of unemployment in 2001-2002, and 2003-2004.
These events were beyond his control.  But he did work for an uncle’s construction company so he
was not destitute.  However, several of these debts were only a few hundred dollars, and he made
no effort to pay on any of them.  He gave no cogent reason why he paid nothing.  He was not
required to repay his student loans and he has not made any payments.  Thus mitigating condition
E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.  
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.
Even though he has recently attended two financial management courses as directed by the
bankruptcy court, Applicant did not seek counseling in the past, and even after attending these two
courses, he has not prepared a budget.  As discussed below, he does not have his financial affairs
under control.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve bad debts) is not applicable.  There is no evidence as to why he could pay
nothing on the smaller debts, notwithstanding periods of unemployment.  He was not totally
unemployed as he worked for an uncle’s construction business.  Filing bankruptcy a month before
the hearing might be evidence of debt resolution, but not in this instance.  Three collection accounts
preceded his discharge from the Marine Corps, so his financial problems were not caused by
unemployment, but exacerbated by it.  In addition, he took on substantial new debt with his
educational loans, with no plan for repayment.  They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  He has
continued to defer the loan repayments by staying in school, and stated he intended to stay in school
until such time he could afford a monthly payment.  He is operating at a deficit now.  He recently
committed to a $600 per month car payment, payable over six years.  He waited until after the SOR
was filed to make any effort at debt resolution.  His student loans are problematic as at some point
he must commence payment.  He can’t afford to make payments now, and by continuing in school
and borrowing more money, he is only compounding his financial problems.  I conclude Guideline
F against Applicant.
Whole Person Analysis
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.”   “Available,28
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be

considered in reaching a determination.”   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,29
I also considered the “whole person” concept in evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in
protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (31), his education, his marine corps service,30
the causes of his financial problems, and the reasons he gave for not making progress on debt
repayment.  Applicant made no progress in reducing his debt.  He waited until one month before the
hearing to file bankruptcy.  He has a sizable student loan, has made no payments on it, is continuing
to attend school, and thus will increase his borrowing and indebtedness.  His income is insufficient
to pay his monthly expenses.  The totality of the record  raises continuing doubts about Applicant's
ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance.
FORMAL FINDINGS
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required
by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.f: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g: Against Applicant
DECISION
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.
