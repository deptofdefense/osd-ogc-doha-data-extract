During her marriage, Applicant and her husband used credit to purchase goods. When his
work hours significantly declined, they could not pay their bills. After they separated, Applicant lived
on her income alone. She obtained the services of a credit counselor to work out a resolution of her
old debts; and developed a payment plan with one creditor. She pays her current bills and lives
within her financial means. She did not intentionally falsify her answers on the questionnaire. She
has mitigated the government’s concerns under Guidelines F and E. Eligibility for trustworthiness
is granted.
STATEMENT OF CASE
On October 2, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an
ADP I/II/III position, which she resubmitted on August 18, 2004 and resigned on October 24, 2004.
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review
Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").  On August 25, 2006, DOHA issued1
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in
essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).
In a sworn statement dated September 22, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations
and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned this case to me on December 21, 2006. DOHA issued a
notice of hearing on January 29, 2007, which Applicant received about a week before the hearing.
At the hearing on February 15, 2007, Applicant waived her right to 15 days notice of the hearing,
which was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six exhibits (GE), which were
marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted 12 exhibits
(App Ex) which were marked and admitted into the record as App Ex A-L without objection. She
testified on her own behalf. The record was held open until March 8, 2007, to allow Applicant to
submit further documents, which she timely did. She submitted 12 additional documents, which were
marked and admitted as App Ex M-X without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)
on March 9, 2007.
FINDINGS OF FACT
In her SOR response, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l under
Guideline F. She also admitted 1.b and 1.j under Guideline F, but denied the amount owed. She
denies all of the remaining allegations under Guideline F and the Guideline E allegations.
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.2

Applicant, a 34-year-old woman seeking a position of public trust, works as a claims
associate for a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her employer for 10 years. She
is a high school graduate with technical college training. She married in 1999 and separated from
her husband around Christmas of 2001.3
Financial Considerations
During her marriage, Applicant and her husband purchased cars and established credit
accounts based on their income. Her husband’s work hours declined from 48 to 60 hours a week to
30 hours a week. The resulting loss of income impacted their ability to pay their bills. They
voluntarily returned one car to the note holder for resale, as they could not meet the monthly
payment. The note holder repossessed another car, when they failed to meet the monthly payments.
They also got behind in other bills. Their financial problems also impacted their marriage.4
A review of Applicant’s credit reports dated October 20, 2001, May 11, 2004, June 14, 2006,
and the SOR shows 12 unpaid debts totaling $28,576. The current status of these debts is as follows:5

Applicant’s gross monthly pay is $2,425 plus occasional overtime. Her net monthly pay
varies, but is approximately $2,137. Her monthly expenses include $610 for rent, $70 for electricity,
$60 for cable, $60 for telephone, $140 for gasoline, $103 for insurance, $220 for food, $200 for car
payment, and $100 on debt payment for total monthly expenses of $1,563. She did not include
miscellaneous expenses or clothing, which I estimate at $100. She also provides her elderly, ill, and
retired father $200 a month towards the cost of his prescription drugs. With these additional costs,
she has about $300 a month available to pay her debts. She has no credit cards. She anticipates a
significant income tax refund which she plans to use to pay some of her debt.11
In early 2006, Applicant retained the services of a credit counseling agency to help resolve
her credit problems. She paid this agency a fee, but cannot determine with clarity exactly what debts
have been resolved, if any. The credit counseling agency advised her that several debts had been
removed from her credit report. She also challenged some of the debts listed on her credit reports.12
Personal Conduct
On October 2, 2003 and August 18, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position
Application (SF 85-P). She answered “yes” to question 22. Your Financial Record b- “Are you now
over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded

or guaranteed by the Federal Government.),” and listed one debt. She did not list any of the other
debts identified in the SOR.13
Applicant believed that since both cars had been repossessed and sold, she did not owe any
additional money on her debt. Because she had not seen a credit report, she did not remember the
other delinquent debts at the time she completed her application, although she acknowledged that
she had known about these debts in the past. Her management directed staff to complete the
questionnaire as best they could and to guesstimate when they did not know an answer.14
Applicant’s performance review for 2005 rated her at sometimes exceeds expectations and
for 2006 rated her at the highest end of meets expectations. One manager describes her as an
excellent customer service representative. A co-worker describes her as conscientious and energetic,
with a commitment to her work and to others. She is described as a person of integrity, and a person
who now understands the need to manage her finances diligently.15
POLICIES
The President has “the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position …
that will give that person access to such information.”  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding16
Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and
procedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the
executive branch. 
To be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must
meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under
each guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate
funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation
to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly
in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other
aspects of life.

Guideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment,
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly
safeguard classified information. 
Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth
and discussed in the conclusions below.
"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative17
judge must apply the “whole person concept,” and consider and carefully weigh the available,
reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following18
factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)
the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   19
Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR
that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified
information.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,20
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is21
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”  Any doubt22
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be
resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations23
for access to sensitive positions.
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government
has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,
and Guideline E - Personal Conduct. 
The Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue creditors or24
otherwise resolve debts:
In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term
‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that
a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or
obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations
7
Financial Considerations
Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)
E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has many unpaid, delinquent
debts. For most of these debts, she did not make an effort to resolve them.
I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). I cannot apply FC
MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated)
because she still carries a significant amount of outstanding delinquent debts for a variety of bills. She
incurred these debts over several years. Applicant has not paid any of the small debts she
acknowledges are hers.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or
a death, divorce, or separation)) applies in part. Applicant and her husband obtained credit to finance
purchases, primarily new car purchases. When his income declined by almost 50%, they encountered
difficulty with paying their bills. This financial strain lead to their separation, and a reduced
household income for Applicant, who became her own sole support. With only her income, she
cannot pay all her debts at one time.
FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) applies. About one
year ago, Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency to help resolve her credit problems. Through
this agency, she challenged some of the debts listed on her credit report. Her challenges resulted in
a deletion of some debts from her credit reports. She pays her current bills timely, and has not
incurred any significant delinquent debt since 2003.
FC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts) is applicable in part. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to
mitigate the financial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt.
Although Applicant has indicted that she will use her substantial tax return to pay some of her smaller
debts, she has not shown that she has done so. She entered into a payment plan with one creditor in
September 2005and made at least one payment. She, however, has not established she continually and
timely makes the agreed upon payments.24
Mitigating Condition 6. 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.
99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board
specifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a “person who decides not to honor his or her debts
may be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.
Reliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action. However, it would
not demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one’s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations
Mitigating Condition 6.” See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.
Mar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of
FC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (“[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally
unenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding
an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3
(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant’s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute
of limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant’s failure to resolve the
delinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)
(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her
creditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).
See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC25
6 for debts being resolved through garnishment).

She does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application
of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to 11 of her 12 unpaid SOR debts.
See S.C. Code. Ann. § 15-3-530.  The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the25
societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they
stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and
stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of
limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.
Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that
after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred
claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.
Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App.
2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Elimination of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended her
potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer “financially
overextended,” but it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts.
Personal Conduct
Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the
central question does a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly
safeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification
of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a
See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-2313326
at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).
9
security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done
knowingly and willfully.
Under Guideline E, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from her
SF-85P when she answered question 20 b. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her
answer to this question, arguing that she did not know she still owed money on her repossessed cars
and that she did not remember the other debts. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the
government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or
prove an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge
must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial
evidence concerning an applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For26
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission,
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire
. . . .) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning
relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . .) to apply, the government must establish that
Applicant’s omission, concealment or falsification in her answers was deliberate. Applicant credibly
testified that she believed that once she voluntarily returned her car to the note holder and the car was
sold, she no longer owed any money on the car note. She also held this same belief regarding the car
that was involuntarily repossessed. In addition, her testimony that she did not review her credit report
prior to completing her SF-85P is reasonable, as the average individual is not likely to obtain a credit
report to complete an application. Thus, Applicant did not deliberately falsify her trustworthiness
application. The government has not established its case under Guideline E.
Whole Person Analysis
In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The
objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of
a person’s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to
sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in
considering the “whole person” concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality
of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature
thinking, and careful analysis.
I have considered all the evidence and the “whole person” in evaluating Applicant's
trustworthiness. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial
obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns.
She is 34 years old, and sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct. During her
marriage, she and her husband used credit to purchase cars and others items. Their inability to
continue with their monthly debt payments started when her husband’s work hours decreased by
almost 50%. When she and her husband separated, she had to assume full responsibility for her
normal living expenses and her debts, plus some responsibility for joint marital debts. Given her
limited income, she had to make choices about how to use her limited resources. She chose to pay her
living expenses, which she timely does. To her credit, she provides a significant amount of money
See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).27
10
each month to help pay for her father’s expensive prescription drugs, money which would otherwise
be available to pay her old debts. She stopped using credit cards to purchase items. She timely pays
her monthly bills, including her rent. She incurred only one unpaid debt after 2003. 
She sought help to resolve her debt through credit counseling. This avenue has not provided
the assistance she had hoped. The absence of significant, new delinquent debt over the last three years
and compliance with a budget are additional factors which evidence rehabilitation, positive behavior
changes, and self-discipline in regards to her finances. The potential for pressure, coercion,
exploitation, or duress is low because she is current on her recent debts, and has been steadily
employed for the last 10 years. She is very conscious of her income limitations and has shown an
ability to live within her monthly income. Her attitude about her finances and her adherence to her
budget support a determination of trustworthiness.
In sum, in the absence of unanticipated and unusual expenses, the likelihood of new debt
problems is low. Applicant has not only stated an intent to resolve her delinquent debts, she has
developed a payment plan for one large debt, even though she is not legally required to pay this debt
or her other delinquent debts because of the South Carolina 3-year statute of limitations. Although
all of the 12 SOR debts remain unpaid, there is little likelihood that this unpaid debt would present
a security clearance problem as she is not legally liable for 11 of these debts. She is a long-term
employee with a good performance record. She has not been disciplined for violation of patient
privacy issues and there is little likelihood she would violate these privacy rights because of her
existing debt problems. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts
and circumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude she has mitigated the27
trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations, and the personal conduct concerns
are not substantiated.
