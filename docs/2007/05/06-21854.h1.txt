SYNOPSIS

5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).

Applicant has approximately 13 delinquent debts, totaling $16,199. She deliberately failed
to disclose her delinquent accounts on security clearance applications submitted on September 4,
2002, and April 20, 2005.  While intending to resolve her delinquent accounts in the future, the
majority of her delinquent accounts remain unresolved. She has not mitigated the security concerns
raised under financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.
STATEMENT OF CASE
On November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence1
the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,
and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on
December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.
In a sworn statement, dated December 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations
and elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel
submitted the government’s file of relevant material (FORM) on January 24, 2007. The FORM was
mailed to Applicant on January 25, 2007, and received on January 31, 2007. Applicant was afforded
an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.
Applicant did not respond. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. 
PROCEDURAL ISSUES
The case file did not indicate Applicant received a copy of the revised AG. Department
Counsel's FORM cited the old adjudicative guidelines. On March 23, 2007, an Order was sent to
Department Counsel to amend the FORM citing the revised AGs and send a copy of the amended
FORM and a copy of the revised AGs to Applicant. Applicant had 30 days to respond after receipt
of the amended FORM and revised AG.
Applicant received the revised FORM and a copy of the revised AGs on April 2, 2007.  She
timely submitted a nine page response to the amended FORM on May 3, 2007. 
In her December 18, 2006, Response to the SOR, Item 3, Applicant indicated and provided
proof that she got married on October 14, 2006.  She took her husband's last name. The SOR is
amended to reflect her married last name.  Her new last name is in parentheses after her maiden
name in the case caption.

In her SOR response, Applicant denies SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.m and admits to all remaining
allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who
is applying for a security clearance. She is married and has no children.  2
On September 4, 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application, (SF 86).   In3
response to question 38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days. "In the last 7 years, have you ever
been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?", she answered, "No." At the time she filled out the
SF 86, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e were over 180 days delinquent. She also
answered, "No" in response to question 39. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days. "Are you
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f were
over 90 days delinquent.   
On April 20, 2005, Applicant completed another security clearance application, (SF 86).4
In response to question 38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days. "In the last 7 years, have you
ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?", she answered, "No." At the time she filled out
the SF 86, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.k were over 180 days delinquent. She also
answered, "No" in response to question 39. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days. "Are you
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.k were
over 90 days delinquent.   
The delinquent accounts included a $1,077 credit card account charged off in April 2000
(SOR ¶ 1.a);  a $2,639 collection account turned over for collection in September 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.b);
a $522 delinquent account delinquent since November 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.c); a $844 catalogue account
charged off in December 2000 (SOR ¶ 1.d); a $1,215 account placed for collection in November
2000 (SOR ¶ 1.e); a $595 account placed for collection in May 2002 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a $156  account
placed for collection in April 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.g); a $6,209 credit card account placed for collection
in July 2003 (SOR ¶ 1.h); a $93 insurance bill placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.i); a
$502 medical account placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR ¶ 1.j); a $86 insurance bill  placed

February 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.l); and a $770 account placed for collection in August 2005. (SOR ¶ 1.m).5
Applicant denies the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. She acknowledges that she owes  the debt
but disputes the balance. She has not talked with the creditor/collection agency in over a year
because of their aggressive collection tactics.  She denies the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. She6
contracted with a firm to attend a program that promised to help her obtain a federal job. She claims

she cancelled the contract within seven days as allowed by the contract. The company claims she did
not cancel and owes them the full amount. She did not save any paperwork. She is disputing the
account on her credit report.7
Applicant paid the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l which is a cell phone account. She settled the
account for $600 on September 23, 2005.  She entered into a payment plan with the creditor for the8
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g.  She agreed to pay $25 per month on the 14th of each month.
She provided copies of the checks sent to the creditor in November, February, March and April. She
claims she paid the December and January payments online.  No documentation was provided9
verifying these two payments were made.
Applicant sent letters to the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i and 1.k.  She has not heard
back from these creditors.   She has not contacted the creditors alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.10
She intends to contact them within the next month to establish a payment plan or a settlement that
she can afford to pay.11
In her response to the SOR, Applicant stated "I first must apologize for making false
statements about my debt. It hasn't been until recently that I have started to take my credit more
seriously by making sure I pay my debts on time."   In her response to the revised FORM, Applicant12
claims that although she admits to providing a false statement on her security clearance application,
she was unaware of her credit situation at the time she submitted her 2002 and 2005 security
clearance applications.   13
POLICIES
The President has “the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position …
that will give that person access to such information.”  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding14
Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and
procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch.

To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines
contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on
December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,
sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating
conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's
means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,
lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can
raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect
classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.15
Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with
the security clearance process.16
Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and
discussed in the conclusions below.
“The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person’s life to make
an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.”   An administrative17
judge must apply the “whole person concept,” and consider and carefully weigh the available,
reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following
factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)
the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is
voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)
the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and
(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  18
Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR
that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified

information.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,19
extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.20
“Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of the national security.”  21
A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the
government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual
a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a
clearance.
CONCLUSIONS
I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government
has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guidelines F and E.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. She has encountered financial
problems over the past several years, accumulating 13 delinquent accounts, totaling approximately
$16,199. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) ¶19(a) (inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC ¶19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)
apply to Applicant's case. By her own admission, Applicant was not very responsible when it came
to handling her financial affairs in the past. Although Applicant settled one account and is making
payments towards two other debts, her remaining delinquent accounts remain unresolved.  
The financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that none apply.  Applicant did
not provide information which would indicate that her financial problems were caused by conditions
that were beyond her control. There is no indication Appellant received financial counseling. The
majority of the debts remain unresolved. 
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central
question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any
written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.
7
Applicant admits to deliberately falsifying her security clearance applications submitted on September
4, 2002, and April 20, 2005, with regard to her delinquent accounts. 
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition ¶16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or
falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,
or similar fo I give little weight to her recent clarifications that she was unaware of her delinquent
accounts when filling out the her security clearance applications.  rm used to conduct investigations,
determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.  
None of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply.  Applicant deliberately withheld
the fact that she had delinquent debts on two separate security clearance applications.  In her  response
to the SOR,  she apologized for "making false statements about my debt" noting that she only recently
started to make sure that her debts were paid on time. In her response to the revised FORM, dated
May 1, 2007, she claims she was not aware of her delinquent accounts when she filled out her security
clearance applications. I do not find this supplemental response credible considering her prior
apology.   
I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the “whole person” concept in
evaluating Applicant’s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has
failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations and personal conduct
concern. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.
