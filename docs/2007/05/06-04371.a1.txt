The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security

of the basis for that decision—security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as
amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 3, 2007, after the hearing,
Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
On May 15, 2007, Department Counsel filed a Motion for Expedited Remand.  On May 16,
2007, Applicant filed a response to the government’s motion stating that he joined in Department
Counsel’s motion.
  Accordingly, in the interest of administrative economy, the case his hereby remanded to the
Judge for further processing.  Nothing about this action shall prejudice the appeal rights of the
parties.
