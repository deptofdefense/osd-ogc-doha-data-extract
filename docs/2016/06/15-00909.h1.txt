HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) includes allegations of delinquent debts, 
federal income tax returns not timely filed or paid, and a felony arrest in 2011. 
Applicant’s felony-level arrest and charge did not result in a conviction and is not recent. 
Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. He did not make enough progress 
paying his debts to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Access to 
classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On August 7, 2012, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 17, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
   
 
2 
 
 
Specifically, the SOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F (financial 
considerations) and E (personal conduct). 
 
On September 7, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR. On March 11, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 15, 2016, the case was assigned 
to me. On March 15, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 31, 2016. (HE 1) Applicant waived his 
right under the Directive to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of his 
hearing. (Tr. 13-14) His hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 5 exhibits, and Applicant offered 
17 exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 19-27; GE 1-5; AE A-Q) On 
April 8, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing. The record was 
held open for additional evidence until May 2, 2016. (Tr. 74-75, 77) No post-hearing 
evidence was received. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 
1.f, 1.i through 1.n, and 2.a. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g, and 1.h. He 
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old operations planner, who has been employed in 
operations planning since he retired from the Army in 2005. (Tr. 5; GE 1; AE E; AE L)  
In 1983, he graduated from high school, and he completed about one year of college. 
(Tr. 5) He married in 1986, and he was divorced in 1990. (Tr. 8) He has a 12-year-old 
daughter. (Tr. 8) He served in the Army from 1983 to 2005, and he honorably retired as 
a first sergeant (E-8). (Tr. 6) He deployed to Southwest Asia for Operation Desert 
Shield/Storm and to Iraq twice for Operation Iraqi Freedom. (Tr. 6-7, 30-31) His resume 
indicated, and he said he received six Meritorious Service Medals (MSM), six Army 
Commendation Medals (ARCOM), and four Army Achievement Medals (AAM). (Tr. 29; 
AE L)     
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, October 
19, 2012 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), 
SOR response, and hearing record.  
 
 Applicant failed to timely file his federal income taxes for tax years 2009 and 
2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He filed his tax returns for tax years 2009 and 2010 in 2012. (Tr. 19, 
32-34; AE A) Applicant was distracted by the death of his mother and disputes with the 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

mother of his daughter. (Tr. 33) Then he erroneously thought his bookkeeper filed his 
tax returns. (Tr. 33) In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wrote Applicant and 
stated they received Applicant’s tax returns for 2009 and 2010; however, Schedule A 
was incomplete or missing. (AE C) The IRS garnished his paychecks for four months, 
which caused other debts to become delinquent. (Tr. 55) In October 2012, Applicant 
and the IRS reached a settlement, and Applicant agreed to pay the IRS $200 monthly. 
(AE C) On his August 7, 2012 SF 86, he disclosed that he owed $5,456 to the IRS for 
tax year 2009, and he owed $1,555 for tax year 2010. (GE 1) He completed payment of 
his delinquent tax debts in July 2015. (Tr. 69; AE C; AE D)   
 
 Applicant’s federal income tax records (AE A-C) indicate: 
 
Tax Year Adjusted Gross 
Income 
Refund + Taxes Owed - 
2015 $103,452 +$1,213  
2014 $98,798 +$582  
2013 $99,288 +$523  
2012 $101,473 +$2,431  
2011 $94,246  -$107 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are collection debts for $3,535 and $2,095, and both debts 
are owed to the same collection company. (Tr. 34-35) Applicant said they may be 
collecting the bank debt in SOR ¶ 1.g for $1,708 and the two charged-off debts to the 
same bank in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k of unspecified amounts. (Tr. 35) SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.j 
and SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.k are the same accounts. (Tr. 37) There was a class action 
lawsuit for deceptive practices, which resulted in Applicant receiving checks for $102 
and $7. (Tr. 35-36; AE M; AE N) On June 17, 2015, the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.b offered to 
settle the debt for $1,414. (Tr. 38) He did not make any payments to the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g. (Tr. 54) Applicant decided not to settle the debt. (Tr. 39) Applicant is credited with 
mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k as duplications.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d is a charged-off debt for $2,064. (Tr. 39) The creditor wrote that the 
balance was $2,353, and the creditor offered to settle the debt for $1,412. Applicant did 
not pay the creditor anything. (Tr. 40)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e is a charged-off debt for $1,869. (Tr. 40) The creditor wrote that the 
balance was $1,869; the most recent payment was in May 2010; and in 2015, the 
creditor offered to settle the debt for $550. (Tr. 40) Applicant did not pay the creditor 
anything. (Tr. 40) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a charged-off debt of unspecified amount owed to a bank. Applicant 
believed it was from a gas card. (Tr. 54) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h is a charged-off utility debt for $228. Applicant had a letter from a 
collection company seeking payment. (Tr. 41) Applicant called the utility company and 
was informed he did not owe anything. (Tr. 41-42) 
   
 
4 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a telecommunications-collection debt for $147. (Tr. 52) He disputed 
his responsibility for the debt because the creditor breached the contract by failing to 
provide maintenance for equipment. (Tr. 52)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l is a $4,230 debt for furniture. Applicant made some payments, and he 
was unable to continue making payments. (Tr. 32) He told the furniture store to 
repossess the furniture. (Tr. 32) He provided a March 9, 2012 letter from the creditor 
acknowledging receipt of $500 and indicating additional $500 payments were supposed 
to be made. (AE Q) The creditor’s letter did not specify the balance owed on the debt. 
(AE Q) Applicant said the debt is resolved. (Tr. 32) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m is a collection debt for $2,257 from a home-alarm company. Applicant 
disputed his responsibility for the debt because the home-alarm company failed to 
comply with the contract. (Tr. 45) He telephoned the home-alarm company and 
communicated his concerns about contract compliance, and he informed the home-
alarm company that the contract was terminated. (Tr. 45-46) He did not have 
documentation showing the basis of the dispute. (Tr. 46, 52) He offered to generate and 
provide a letter disputing his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 46)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.n is a charged-off debt owed to the Army and Air Force Exchange 
System (AAFES) of an unspecified amount. (Tr. 43) Applicant said he recently paid 
AAFES $1,200 and had paid AAFES a total of almost $2,000. (Tr. 43) His retirement 
pay was being debited $100 monthly, and then the IRS intercepted his tax refund for 
$1,200. (Tr. 44) He still owes a small amount to AAFES. (Tr. 51) 
 
In sum, Applicant paid his federal income tax debt in 2015, and he is credited 
with paying most of his AAFES debt in SOR ¶ 1.n. (Tr. 69-71) In 2015, Applicant paid 
the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.l $500. (Tr. 70) He brought his mortgage to current status. (Tr. 
72) Applicant accepted responsibility for his debts, and he promised to pay his 
remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 57-59) I asked Applicant to submit proof of his debt 
disputes, payments to AAFES, and his DD Form 214 to show his military awards and 
deployments. (Tr. 49-51, 53, 73) His suspense to provide additional evidence was May 
2, 2016. (Tr. 74-75, 77) No post-hearing documentation was received.    
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 In August 2011, Applicant was upset about his employment, and he could not 
sleep. (Tr. 17-18) At about midnight, Applicant went for a walk, and he left his seven-
year-old daughter alone. (GE 3) She woke up; she became frightened because she was 
alone; and shortly after midnight, she called 911. (Tr. 17-18; GE 3) At about 2:30 a.m., 
Applicant walked up to his residence. (GE 3) The police arrested him for child 
abandonment and drunk and disorderly. (GE 3) Applicant told the police he was walking 
around the block. (GE 3) The drunk and disorder charge was a misdemeanor, and it 
was dismissed. (GE 3) He pleaded guilty to child abandonment, a felony, and he 
received two years of deferred adjudication. (Tr. 17-18; SOR response; GE 3) He was 
required to complete and did complete 200 hours of community service. (Tr. 18-19) He 
   
 
5 
 
 
paid a $2,200 fine. (Tr. 59) He does not have a criminal conviction for his conduct in 
August 2011 because he successfully completed his probation. He attended parenting 
classes, and he went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. (Tr. 58-59) He disclosed 
his felony-level child abandonment arrest on his August 7, 2012 SF 86 and discussed 
the events surrounding his arrest during his OPM PSI. (GE 1; GE 2) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor for four years is a retired lieutenant colonel and has 
frequent contact with Applicant. (Tr. 62-64) He described Applicant as dependable, 
responsible, diligent, conscientious about security, and trustworthy. (Tr. 63) His 
employment appraisals describe Applicant as meeting, exceeding, or consistently 
exceeding expectations. (AE E) Applicant received bonuses and letters of appreciation 
from his employer for his contributions to mission accomplishment, and he completed 
security training. (AE F-K)    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
   
 
6 
 
 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, OPM PSI, SOR response, and 
hearing record.  
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income taxes for tax years 2009 and 
2010. In 2012, he filed his tax returns for tax years 2009 and 2010. In 2012, the IRS 
   
 
7 
 
 
wrote Applicant and stated they received Applicant’s tax returns for 2009 and 2010; 
however, Schedule A was incomplete or missing. The IRS garnished his paychecks for 
four months, which caused other debts to become delinquent. In October 2012, 
Applicant and the IRS reached a settlement, and Applicant agreed to pay the IRS $200 
monthly. On his August 7, 2012 SF 86, he disclosed that he owed $5,456 to the IRS for 
tax year 2009, and he owed $1,555 for tax year 2010. He completed payment of his 
delinquent tax debts in July 2015.    
 
Applicant has nine unresolved delinquent debts totaling $16,694. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
  
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
   
 
8 
 
 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts; however, he presented 
some important mitigating information. Several circumstances beyond his control 
adversely affected his finances: Applicant was deployed to Iraq; his mother died; and he 
had disputes with the mother of his daughter about his daughter. However, he did not 
provide enough specifics about how these circumstances adversely affected his 
finances, and he did not show that he acted responsibly to address his delinquent 
debts.       
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax years 2009 and 
2010. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961).

ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
commented that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employment of an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information and focusing on problematic timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the 
SOR).   
 
Applicant filed his 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns in 2012, which is 
well before the SOR was issued; however, he did not pay his delinquent taxes for those 
years until 2015.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f (unspecified 
amount), 1.h (paid), 1.j (duplication), 1.k (duplication), and 1.n (mostly paid). He is not 
credited with mitigating the other SOR debts because he did not provide documentation 
showing enough progress paying debts or reasonable disputes of his debts, such as 
copies of letters to the SOR creditors and credit reporting companies explaining why he 
believed he was not responsible for the debts. 
   
Applicant’s failure to make greater progress addressing his delinquent debts 
shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs against approval of his security 
clearance. There is insufficient evidence about why he was unable to make greater 
documented progress resolving more of his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance 
that his financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in 
the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.

  Three disqualifying conditions in AG ¶ 16 that are relevant in this case. AG ¶¶ 
16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e) read: 
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule 
violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another 
country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is 
legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a 
basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence 
service or other group. 
 
  AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply. Applicant abandoned his seven-year-old 
daughter between shortly after midnight and 2:30 a.m., which is a felony-level crime. 
Guideline J, criminal conduct, explicitly covers this criminal offense involving his 
daughter. The financial consideration section is sufficient for an adverse determination 
without consideration of his abandonment of his daughter. AG ¶ 16(e) applies because 
this criminal conduct adversely affects his personal, professional, and community 
standing.   
 
  AG ¶ 17 lists three conditions, which may mitigate security concerns in this case. 
The three mitigating conditions are as follows:  
  
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
   
 
11 
 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) apply. In August 2011, Applicant left his daughter 
unattended. He received deferred adjudication from the court, and he successfully 
completed the probation period. He does not have a conviction. Security officials, the 
courts, and law enforcement are aware of his misconduct, and he is not subject to 
coercion. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old operations planner, who has been employed in 
operations planning since he retired from the Army in 2005. He completed about one 
year of college. He served in the Army from 1983 to 2005, and he honorably retired as a 
first sergeant. He deployed to Southwest Asia for Operation Desert Shield/Storm and to 
Iraq twice for Operation Iraqi Freedom. His resume indicated, and he said he received 
six MSMs, six ARCOMs, and four AAMs. However, he did not provide his DD Form 214, 
which would have provided the dates of his service in combat zones and a specific list 
of his awards and decorations.

Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f (unspecified 
amount), 1.h ($228—paid), 1.j (unspecified amount—duplication), 1.k (unspecified 
amount—duplication), and 1.n (mostly paid). He is also credited with payment of his 
delinquent federal income tax debt in 2015. In 2015, Applicant paid the creditor in SOR 
¶ 1.l $500; however, this payment is not sufficient to fully establish mitigation of this 
debt. He brought his mortgage to current status.  
 
Applicant has a lengthy history of delinquent debt. He failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2009 and 2010. In 2012, those two returns were 
filed; however, the taxes on those two tax returns were not completely paid until 2015. 
He is not credited with mitigating the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e, 1.f and 1.g, 1.i, 
1.l, and 1.m because he did not provide documentation showing enough progress 
paying these debts or reasonable disputes of these debts, such copies of letters to the 
SOR creditors and credit reporting companies disputing his responsibility for them.   
 
Applicant did not provide enough specifics about how circumstances beyond his 
control adversely affected his finances, and he did not show that he acted responsibly to 
address his delinquent debts. His failure to make greater progress resolving his SOR 
debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated 
questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that personal conduct security concerns are mitigated; however, 
financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s security clearance eligibility at 
this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.j and 1.k:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.l and 1.m:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.n:    For Applicant    
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT  
  
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
