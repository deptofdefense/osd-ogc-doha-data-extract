Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for
access to classified information. She had financial problems leading to a home
foreclosure in 2008 due to a combination of her husband’s unexpected job loss in 2007,
and her husband’s abandonment of their marriage in 2008. She met her burden to
present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the financial considerations security
concern. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on February 17, 2012.  More than two years later on1
November 7, 2014, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a2
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action3
under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. She
answered the SOR on December 18, 2014, and requested a hearing.         
The case was assigned to me on October 28, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on January 6, 2016. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on
January 13, 2016.
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation.
She made two separate post-hearing submissions, and those matters are admitted
without objections as Exhibits S–V. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 57-year-old senior consultant who works in planning and
coordinating meetings and events. Her education includes a bachelor’s degree in
education awarded in 1982. She married in 1987, although she and her husband
separated and have lived apart since 2008. She has one adult child from the marriage.
She intends to seek a divorce in the near future. 
Applicant has worked for her current employer or its successor-in-interest since
2006.  Before that, she worked as an executive assistant and officer manager from4
March 2000 to February 2006. In between those two periods, she was unemployed from
February 2006 to September 2006 for about nine months. Her unemployment resulted
from a job layoff due to the company going out of business.    
Applicant presented substantial evidence of a good employment record as well
as her good character and suitability for a security clearance.  In September 2015, she5
received the Director’s Award for Excellence for her exemplary teamwork in preparing,

planning, and execution of a major meeting.  A recent job performance appraisal gave6
her an overall rating of exceeds expectations, which is the highest rating available.  In7
addition, Applicant’s supervisor submitted a strong letter of recommendation in which
she stated that she has “consistently seen [Applicant] demonstrate good judgment, a
strong moral character, and highly responsible behavior.”  8
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has the following delinquent
financial accounts: (1) a $97,273 charged-off account stemming from a home
foreclosure; (2) two medical collection accounts, with unnamed creditors, for $86 and
$38; and (3) three collection accounts for $1,153, $717, and $828 owed to a
homeowner’s association (HOA). Applicant disclosed defaulted mortgage loans in her
2012 security clearance application; she admitted owing the six delinquent accounts in
her answer to the SOR; and the six debts are established by credit reports from 2012
and 2014.  9
Applicant and her husband purchased a home in early 2005 for about $500,000.
They financed the transaction with two mortgage loans for $392,000 and $99,941.  The10
lesser of the two loans is now alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. Both mortgage loans went into
default after her husband’s unexpected job loss in 2007. To this day, Applicant does not
know the reason for her husband’s job loss.  Her husband’s job loss led to the11
breakdown of the marriage. Indeed, Applicant explained that, “[e]verything just went
downhill from there. My husband just lost his mind, I guess, or just sunk to [a] low. I’m
sure this affected him because he left the house.”  12
Applicant’s husband had been the primary breadwinner and managed the
household finances. He did not leave contact information, and he did not provide
financial support to Applicant or their son who was still at home at the time. She
attempted to work with the mortgage lenders, but was unsuccessful in modifying the
mortgage loans. She moved out of the house and into an apartment, her current
residence,  in about September 2008, and the home was foreclosed upon. The primary13
mortgage loan was redeemed by the foreclosure, and the 2012 credit report shows a $0

balance.  The lesser mortgage loan was not redeemed by the foreclosure. It was14
transferred or sold to another lender with a balance of $97,273, and then eventually
charged off.15
The two medical collection accounts for $86 and $38 are unresolved.  Applicant16
presented documentation showing payment of two medical bills in 2014 and 2012,
respectively.  The account numbers in the documentation do not match and are not17
similar to the account numbers in the 2014 credit report.18
The three collection accounts for $1,153, $717, and $828 owed to an HOA are
for a time-share property owned outright by Applicant and her husband.  The collection19
accounts are for maintenance fees or dues. The accounts are unresolved.
Applicant is resolving her indebtedness by seeking relief in bankruptcy court. She
retained a bankruptcy attorney before the hearing in this case.  Subsequently, on20
January 11, 2016, a Chapter 7 petition was filed, the creditors meeting occurred on
February 8, 2016, and a discharge of Applicant’s dischargeable debts should be
granted within 60 days of the meeting.     21
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As22
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt23
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

 Executive Order 10865, § 7.32
5
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An24
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  25
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting26
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An27
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate28
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  29
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s30
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.31
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it32
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant33
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 34
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  35
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as an inability to satisfy debts.  That conclusion is36
supported by the defaulted mortgage loans leading to the home foreclosure, the two
medical collection accounts, and the three collection accounts owed to the HOA. With
that said, I have given little weight to the medical collection accounts. The amounts at
issue, $86 and $38, are minor if not puny. It is also presumed that the medical expenses
were incurred for necessary medical care as opposed to frivolous or irresponsible
spending, consistent spending beyond one’s means, or financial problems that are
linked to issues of security concern. 
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,37
and the following are most pertinent:  
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not

cast doubt on the [person’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control. 
Applicant receives credit under all three of the mitigating conditions mentioned
above. The evidence shows her financial problems date back to the 2007–2008 period.
The home foreclosure in 2008 was due to a combination of her husband’s unexpected
job loss in 2007, and her husband’s abandonment of their marriage in 2008. Her
husband’s job loss and departure were unexpected events that are unlikely to recur. I’m
sure her husband’s abrupt departure hit her hard. On her own, she lacked the means to
satisfy her financial obligations. She was forced to move into an apartment and she
made the necessary adjustments to her lifestyle to live on her income. Throughout that
difficult period, she continued to work at a high level. Obviously, she could not have
anticipated abandonment by her husband and the associated loss of income when she
agreed to repay the mortgage loans in 2005. And it is unlikely that Applicant would have
incurred any of the delinquent financial accounts in the SOR but for her husband’s
unexpected job loss and his abandonment of the marriage.
Since the foreclosure, Applicant has endeavored to live within her means. She is
now working with a bankruptcy attorney to resolve the residual financial issues
associated with her husband’s abandonment. In other words, the pending Chapter 7
bankruptcy case is a clear indication that her unresolved indebtedness is being resolved
and is under control. Once her bankruptcy case is finished, obtaining a divorce is the
next step. Applicant did not present a perfect case in mitigation, but she did present
sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the financial considerations security concern. 
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties does not create doubt
about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I38
conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information.
