GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 5, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. She 
responded to those interrogatories on February 18, 2014.2 On January 21, 2015, the 
DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On February 2, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on June 5, 2015. The case was initially assigned to another 
administrative judge on June 15, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 8, 2015, 
scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2015. However, because Applicant’s daughter was 
scheduled for surgery on that date, upon Applicant’s request, the hearing was 
postponed. The case was reassigned to me on October 5, 2015. A Notice of Hearing 
was issued on October 28, 2015. I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 
18, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 30, 2015. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it with specifically identified 
documentation that she claimed she had at home, and on June 21, 2016, she took 
advantage of that opportunity and submitted two additional exhibits (AE J and AE K) 
which were admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 21, 
2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with brief explanations a majority 
of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.d., 
1.e., 1.g. through 1.i, 1.k. through 1.r., 1.t., 1.v., 1.bb., 1.dd., 1.hh., 1.jj., and 1.ll.). She 
denied the remaining allegations, also with brief explanations. Applicant’s answers are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a 
project manager for janitorial services since April 2009.3 She held a number of diverse 
positions with other employers over the years, including that of school kitchen and 
dietary substitute, school bus aide, assembly parts inspector, cashier, cook, and lead 
cleaner. Applicant completed the 11th grade, but dropped out of school to care for her

mother, and she received a General Educational Development (GED) diploma in 1997.4 
She has never served with the U.S. military.5 She has never held a security clearance.6 
Applicant was married in June 1981 and divorced in May 2001. She married her current 
husband in March 2003.7 She has four daughters, born in March 1977, September 
1978, June 1981, and March 1983.8 
 
Financial Considerations9 
 
It is unclear when Applicant’s initial financial difficulties arose, but it appears that 
several factors contributed to them over a multi-year period: she was divorced in 2001; 
her ex-husband failed to support her or their children; she had severe health problems 
with a delayed diagnosis from late 2000 until approximately 2003; she has not had any 
health insurance since 2000; she had several low-wage jobs with annual salaries of 
between $9,000 and $10,000; she was unemployed from May 2000 until February 
2003; and her niece, as well as her nephew, took financial advantage of her.10  
In May 2003, upon realizing the extent of her medical bills, Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although her 
credit report indicated that payments were made, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in 
September 2003, Applicant stated it was dismissed because the Trustee had resigned. 
She subsequently refiled the bankruptcy in November 2004. The credit report indicated 
that payments were again made, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in December 2005, 
but Applicant contended that she made monthly payments of approximately $400 for a 
period of approximately seven years, satisfying all of those delinquent accounts.11 
In 2007, Applicant became eligible for Social Security Disability benefits. The 
$1,000 monthly benefit was directly deposited into her daughter’s account. As Applicant 
started to improve, she started searching for work. In 2009, when she checked with the 
Social Security Administration (SSA) to determine how much she could earn without 
losing her benefits. She was given a figure between $11,000 and $12,000. When 
Applicant was initially hired by her current employer, her hourly salary was $11, based 
on a 40-hour work week. She was below the SSA maximum. Shortly thereafter

however, a manager was fired, and Applicant was expected to work overtime. Her 
augmented salary resulted in her exceeding the SSA maximum. About one year later, it 
was determined that Applicant was no longer eligible for her benefit, and that, in fact, 
she owed the SSA a refund of benefits received after she became ineligible. The 
overpayment was $18,238.10.12 
As a result of the expenses caused by the above factors, Applicant found it 
difficult to continue making routine monthly payments on her accounts. Medical 
accounts and a variety of other accounts became delinquent. Two judgments were filed. 
In March 2014 – ten months before the SOR was issued – Applicant turned her 
attention to her financial morass. She purportedly contacted her creditors, disputed 
some accounts as not being hers, eventually entered into some repayment agreements, 
and paid other accounts. At some point, Applicant engaged the professional services of 
a law firm to assist her in repairing her credit and having some disputed accounts 
removed from her credit reports.13 
The SOR identified 38 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $35,000, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or filed as 
judgments. Of the 38 accounts, 17 are medical accounts which are identified by 
complete or partial account numbers, but the identity of the actual medical 
providers/creditors remains unknown. Applicant’s SOR-related accounts generally fall 
within several different categories pertaining to their resolution status: (a) those for 
which payment arrangements have been agreed to, and payments were either made or 
are being made, and for which that status is supported by documentation; (b) those for 
which payment arrangements have purportedly been agreed to and payments were 
either made or are purportedly being made, and for which that status is not supported 
by documentation; and (c) those for which no action has yet been taken. 
Those accounts for which payment arrangements have been agreed to, and 
payments were either made or are being made, and for which that status is supported 
by some documentation, are the following:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is the SSA overpayment of $18,238.10 that was being 
resolved in several different ways. Applicant’s 2013 income tax refund in the amount of 
$1,341.37 was applied in March 2014;14 a remittance in the amount of $696.21 was 
made in August 2014;15 and Applicant had purportedly made monthly payments of $100 
for at least four months, and made a $50 payment in June 2015.16 In her February 2014

 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated February 2, 2015, at 1; Tr. at 37-41. Applicant explained that she 
temporarily stopped making the monthly payments when her daughter had surgery for two aneurysms and she had to 
care for her and assist her grandson in leaving for college.

answers to the interrogatories, she contended she was on a repayment plan and was 
paying $50 per month. She also stated that she had presented documentation 
supporting her contentions.17 Undated documentation (issued after August 2014) 
reflected a current debt balance of $15,550.52,18 and during the hearing Applicant 
estimated the current balance to be $12,000.19 Applicant’s recent Personal Financial 
Statement, submitted in June 2016, does not reflect any continuing payments to SSA.20 
There is no evidence of recent continuing efforts to resolve this account over the past 
12 months. 
(SOR ¶ 1.o.): This is an unspecified loan with a high credit of $180 that was past 
due $252 when it was charged off. Applicant paid the entire balance in June 2014.21 
The account has been resolved. (SOR ¶ 1.w.): This is an unspecified loan with a high 
credit of $39 that was past due and charged off. Applicant paid the entire balance in 
June 2014.22 The account has been resolved. (SOR ¶ 1.x.): This is an unspecified loan 
that was unpaid when the creditor obtained a judgment in the amount of $617. Applicant 
paid the entire balance in May 2014.23 The account has been resolved.  
Those accounts for which payment arrangements have purportedly been agreed 
to and payments were either made or are purportedly being made, and for which that 
status is not supported by documentation, despite Applicant’s assurances that such 
documentation would be submitted, are the following: 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is an apartment lease opened by Applicant’s niece, using 
Applicant’s identification, with an unpaid balance of $2,897 that Applicant initially 
disputed, but subsequently agreed to payments on the reduced balance of $750;24 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a bank account with an outstanding balance of $738 that was 
charged off. Applicant said she had a repayment agreement in place and the week 
before the hearing, she made her first monthly payment of $30;25 (SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a 
payday loan with an outstanding balance of $618 that Applicant initially disputed, but 
she eventually agreed to a repayment plan. The week before the hearing, she made her 
first monthly payment of $15;26 (SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is an unspecified account with a past-

due balance of $600 that Applicant initially contended she had made repayment 
arrangements, but later disavowed any knowledge of the account;27  (SOR ¶¶ 1.g., 1.h., 
and 1.i.): These are medical bills with respective outstanding balances of $484, $441, 
and $406, that Applicant initially disputed, then claimed she paid two of them in full, but 
now contends she will be paying $15 per month.28 It is unclear if she intends to pay that 
amount per account or if that is the cumulative balance; (SOR ¶ 1.j.): This is for a loan 
with a high credit of $416 and a past-due balance of $325. Applicant said she had a 
repayment agreement in place, later said she had paid the account, but eventually 
explained that she was confused because she only had one loan with that particular 
creditor.29  
(SOR ¶¶ 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.p., 1.q., 1.t., 1.v., and 1.bb.): These are medical 
bills with respective outstanding balances of $295, $295, $279, $279, $187, $170, $143, 
$103, and $64, that Applicant initially disputed, then claimed she paid them in full;30 
(SOR ¶ 1.s.): This is a cellular telephone account with a past-due balance of $153 that 
Applicant initially disputed because it was not her account but later said she had paid it 
in full.31 (SOR ¶¶ 1.z. and 1.aa.): These are telephone accounts with respective 
outstanding balances of $482 and $163. Applicant acknowledged that she opened the 
larger account for a niece. She initially contended that she had paid both accounts in 
full, but later claimed that she did not recognize the smaller account;32 (SOR ¶ 1.dd.): 
This is a medical bill with a past-due balance of $187 that Applicant contended she had 
paid in full;33 (SOR ¶ 1.ee.): This is a bank-issued credit card with a past-due balance of 
$584 that Applicant contended she had paid in full in 2015;34 (SOR ¶ 1.gg.): This is an 
automobile insurance account with an unpaid balance of $114 that Applicant stated that 
it was not her bill, but later she contended that she had paid it;35 and (SOR ¶¶ 1.jj. and 
1.ll.): These are medical accounts with respective outstanding balances of $64 and 
$109 that Applicant contended she had paid, claiming she had a repayment agreement 
covering the smaller account under which she was paying $10 every two weeks.36

Those accounts for which no action has yet been taken, either because Applicant 
does not recognize the account or the creditor, or she disputes the account or its 
balance, or she simply has not taken any steps to address them, are as follows: 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is telephone account with a past-due balance of $883; (SOR 
¶¶ 1.r. and 1.hh.): These are medical bills with respective outstanding balances of $168 
and $492; (SOR ¶ 1.u.): This is an unspecified account with a past-due balance of 
$120; (SOR ¶ 1.y.) is an unspecified account with an unpaid balance of $265 that went 
to judgment; (SOR ¶ 1.cc.): This is a cable television account with a past-due balance of 
$1,289; (SOR ¶ 1.ff.): This is a checking account with a past-due balance of $1,255; 
(SOR ¶ 1.ii.): This is a wastewater account with an unpaid balance of $329; and (SOR ¶ 
1.kk.): This is a telephone account with an unpaid balance of $610.   
In 2014, Applicant’s adjusted gross income was $69,073, up from the $48,188 
reported for 2013.37 In June 2016, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement 
setting forth her family monthly net income of $7,604; and her monthly household and 
debt expenses of $2,064 (including the only debt payment identified as her mortgage 
payment of $674).38 Those figures should leave her approximately $5,540 per month 
available for discretionary saving or spending. 
Although Applicant indicated she would submit documentation pertaining to each 
of the accounts that she contended were either paid or were in repayment plans, either 
with cancelled checks, bank statements, or receipts from creditors; and documentation 
reflecting her supposedly continuing relationship with the credit-repair law firm that was 
representing her, she failed to do so even though the record was kept open and 
extended to enable her to submit such documentation. Also, she was advised to obtain 
free financial counseling. There is no evidence that she ever did follow up on that 
suggestion. Under the circumstances, without the necessary documentation covering 
the debts, it remains difficult to determine her true account resolution efforts, and if 
Applicant’s finances are under control, or if she is still experiencing financial difficulties. 
Because of the age of the most recent credit report (April 2014) in evidence, it is 
impossible to determine if she has other delinquent accounts. 
Work Performance and Character References 
 A sustainment training manager for a government contractor in whose facility 
Applicant performs some of her duties characterized Applicant in favorable terms. He 
has never had any reason to believe she could not be trusted to protect classified data 
even if it came under her control inadvertently.39 Two of Applicant’s co-workers are also 
very supportive. They refer to her as a highly professional, trustworthy individual who is

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”41 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.44

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”45 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”46 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose over a multi-year period, 
perhaps as early as 2000. There are 38 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts,

totaling approximately $35,000, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or 
filed as judgments. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”47 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. AG ¶ 20(d) minimally applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 
and 20(e) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing 
multi-year period of financial difficulties since 2000 make it difficult to conclude that it 
occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Likewise, her claimed professional 
relationship with a credit-repair law firm, not to offer financial counseling, but instead to 
dispute a number of her delinquent accounts for unspecified reasons, is insufficient to 
raise AG ¶ 20(e), especially in the absence of any documentation to fully describe the 
relationship. Applicant attributed her initial financial problems to a number of factors: 
she was divorced in 2001; her ex-husband failed to support her or their children; she 
had severe health problems with a delayed diagnosis from late 2000 until approximately 
2003; she has not had any health insurance since 2000; she had several low-wage jobs 
with annual salaries of between $9,000 and $10,000; she was unemployed from May 
2000 until February 2003; her niece, as well as her nephew, took financial advantage of 
her; and she was overpaid Social Security benefits.

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
Applicant contended that in 2003 and 2004 she started resolving her delinquent 
accounts after filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. The most recent bankruptcy petition was dismissed in December 2005. Yet, 
Applicant contended that she made monthly payments of approximately $400 for a 
period of approximately seven years, and that she satisfied all of those existing 
delinquent accounts. She did not submit any documentation to support her contentions. 
The SOR-related delinquent accounts, including the judgments, are more recent 
accounts. Applicant failed to explain why additional accounts became delinquent after 
2004, and she failed to identify any conditions or factors that were largely beyond her 
control that may have caused the new financial difficulties. She received an 
overpayment of $18,238.10 from the SSA, but is unable to indicate how those funds 
were used, or explain why they were not used to pay her delinquent debts.  
Applicant has been employed since 2003. In 2013, she had an adjusted gross 
income of $48,188. In 2014, it rose to $69,073. In June 2016, she has a monthly 
remainder of $5,540 available for discretionary saving or spending. Yet, she is not 
paying any of her delinquent accounts, despite claiming to have a number of repayment 
agreements in place with her creditors.  
Despite Applicant’s contentions that she contacted, or would contact, creditors or 
collection agents to establish repayment plans, or that payments were actually made, 
with four exceptions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.o., 1.w., and 1.x.), no meaningful documentation 
was submitted by Applicant to support her contentions. She supplied documentation 
indicating three accounts had been paid off in 2014 and that some payments had been 
made with respect to the SSA overpayment. But there is no evidence of continuing 
payments on that account. Applicant’s failure to furnish documented proof of the 
resolution of the remaining delinquent accounts, despite exhortations to do so, enables 
me to conclude that she made insufficient good-faith efforts to resolve them.  
 
Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. In this instance, there are vaguely described plans 
to resolve financial problems, either by disputing debts or entering into repayment 
arrangements, but there is little documentation to support the existence of repayment 
arrangements or debt payments. There are purported actions taken and some relatively 
insignificant payments made to some creditors, but, with the exception of those 
insignificant payments, there is little documentation to support the existence of most 
Applicant’s actions or payments. Applicant has not acted responsibly by failing to 
address her delinquent accounts.48 Applicant’s relative inaction under the circumstances 
                                                          
48
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
 
12 
                                      
 
confronting her cast substantial doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.49 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.50       
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She is hard-
working and has been with her current employer since April 2009. She is a well-thought 
of individual, both as an employee, co-worker, and friend. She is a caring mother, 
grandmother, wife, and aunt. During the period from 2000 until 2003, Applicant 
encountered several issues that contributed to her financial problems. Approximately a 
decade later, new delinquencies appeared. However, well before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant took some steps in an effort to resolve 4 of the 38 debts eventually listed in the 
SOR. She contended she had either successfully disputed or paid off, or is making 
payments, on a number of her delinquent accounts.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant repeatedly declared that she had successfully disputed some accounts, paid 
off others, or was either working on repayment arrangements or making payments 
under such agreements. She claimed to have documentation to confirm the 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

establishment of repayment plans or payments made. Despite repeated exhortations to 
submit such documentation, with the exception of four accounts, she failed to do so. 
With respect to that fourth account, the SSA overpayment, Applicant’s documentation 
indicated that an income tax refund was applied to the debt and a remittance was made 
in August 2014. Although she claimed to have made continuing payments of $50 or 
$100 per month, with her most recent payment being made in June 2015, once again, 
she failed to submit documentation reflecting those payments. Furthermore, Applicant’s 
June 2016 Personal Financial Statement reflects no continuing payments for any of her 
SOR-related debts, including the SSA debt. The absence of appropriate documentation 
in general, and the presence of no continuing payments in the Personal Financial 
Statement, lead me to conclude that the repayment arrangements and payments do not 
exist. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting her do cast doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 51 
 
Applicant has failed to demonstrate a “meaningful track record” of voluntary debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, in only resolving 3 out of the 38 debts listed in the 
SOR. Without supporting documentation, I cannot credit her with any other significant 
efforts to resolve the remaining 35 delinquent accounts. 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR 
and amended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.n:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.o:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.p. – 1.v:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.w. – 1.x:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.y. – 1.ll:   Against Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
