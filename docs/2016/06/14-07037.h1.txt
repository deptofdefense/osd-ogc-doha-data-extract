HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges three delinquent debts totaling 
$23,482. He failed to provide sufficient information about his finances and documented 
evidence of progress resolving his SOR debts. Financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On August 21, 2014, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 3) On August 3, 
2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued Applicant an SOR pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865,  Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), 
which became effective on September 1, 2006. The SOR set forth security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
On August 20, 2015, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he 
requested a decision without a hearing. On October 7, 2015, Department Counsel 
completed the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On January 4, 2016, Applicant 
received the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. On May 2, 2016, the case 
was assigned to me. The Government’s case consisted of five exhibits. (Items 1-5)

Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, and he denied 
the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, asserting that the two debts were paid. 
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old electronic technologist currently employed by the same 
defense contractor since September 1993.2 He served in the Navy from 1987 to 1993; 
he left active duty as an E-5; and he received an honorable discharge. In 1987, he 
married, and in 1993, he separated from his spouse. His daughter was born in 1987, 
and his son was born in 1988.   
 
Financial Considerations3 
 
 Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his September 3, 2014 
credit report, October 10, 2014 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal 
subject interview (PSI), SF 86, and SOR response. (Items 1-5) He attributed his 
delinquent debt to paying for his son’s college education. (Item 3) His SOR alleges 
three delinquent debts totaling $23,482, and their status is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a December 2007 judgment for $2,581. (Item 1) According to 
Applicant’s OPM PSI, he was unaware of this judgment. (Item 4 at 5) In his SOR 
response, he admitted responsibility for this debt. (Item 4 at 5) Applicant explained the 
debt resulted from his early departure from an apartment because the landlord failed to 
keep raccoons from entering and destroying the apartment. (Item 2) He said he never 
received anything from the courts concerning this debt. (Item 2)      
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off vehicle-related debt for $20,715. He said he paid this 
debt. (Item 2) According to Applicant’s September 3, 2014 credit report, this debt 
became delinquent and was charged off in January 2009, in the amount of $20,715. 
(Item 5) According to Applicant’s OPM PSI, he made an agreement with the creditor in 
July 2013, and he paid this debt. (Item 4 at 5) In his SOR response, he said he paid this 
debt and he had “the payoff information as proof.” However, the proof was not provided 
as part of his SOR response. (Item 2)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $186. According 
to Applicant’s OPM PSI, he was unaware of this debt. (Item 4 at 6) In his SOR 
response, he said he paid this debt and he had “the payoff information as proof.” (Item 
2) However, the proof was not provided as part of his SOR response. (Item 2)    
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
2Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s August 
21, 2014 Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 3)  
 
3Unless stated otherwise the information in this section is from Applicant’s October 9, 2014 Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview. (Item 3) 
 
3 
  
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling. There is no 
evidence that he violated security rules, abused alcohol, or used illegal drugs. 
Department Counsel emphasized, “He has submitted no documentation regarding 
either of the two debts he alleges that he has paid, nor has he provided any 
documentation regarding satisfaction of the judgment against him.” (FORM at 3)   
 
Applicant failed to provide supporting documentary evidence that he paid, 
arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the delinquent 
accounts alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence of Applicant’s income, and he did 
not provide a budget or personal financial statement. The record lacks corroborating or 
substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of the causes for his financial 
problems and other mitigating information. The FORM noted that Applicant had 30 days 
from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary response setting forth 
objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not 
file any objections or submit any additional information . . . your case will be assigned to 
an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in 
this FORM. (FORM at 3) He did not respond to the FORM. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
4 
  
 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his credit report, SF 86, OPM PSI, and SOR response. Applicant’s 
SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $23,482. The record establishes his 
responsibility for these three debts and the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
 
5 
  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant’s stated efforts to resolve his delinquent debt do not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to any of his SOR debts. His decision to pay for 
his son’s college explains how some of his income was allocated; however, he did not 
provide enough details about what he did to address his SOR debts. He did not provide 
evidence of financial counseling.    
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation relating to his SOR debts: (1) 
proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a 
letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) 
correspondence to or from any creditors to establish maintenance of contact with 
creditors;5 (3) credible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for 
the debts and why he held such a belief, and proof that he provided the basis for the 
dispute to the creditor; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement 
offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other 
evidence of progress or resolution of his debts. Applicant failed to establish mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(e) for any of his SOR debts because he did not provide documented 
proof to substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. 
   
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to resolve his 
SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                            
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
7 
  
 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old electronic technologist currently employed by the same 
defense contractor since September 1993. He served in the Navy from 1987 to 1993; 
he left active duty as an E-5; and he received an honorable discharge. There is no 
evidence of abuse of alcohol, security violations, or use of illegal drugs.   
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. His SOR alleges three delinquent 
debts totaling $23,482. He provided insufficient corroborating or substantiating 
documentary evidence of payments to his SOR creditors, payment plans, or his 
communications to those creditors. He did not provide documentation showing his 
attempts to resolve any of his SOR debts in good faith. His failure to provide 
documented evidence of progress resolving his SOR debts shows lack of financial 
responsibility and judgment and raises questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
information about Applicant’s inability to pay his debts and financial history or 
documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated, and it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance 
eligibility at this time. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
