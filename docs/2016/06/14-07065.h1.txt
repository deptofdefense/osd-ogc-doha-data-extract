GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 29, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.2 On June 20, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to her, under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); 
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified

 It should be noted that the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued using Applicant’s marital last name. 
Since she is no longer married to that husband, and has not been since their divorce in 1996, she prefers to be 
known by her maiden name. Hence, the caption of this Decision differs from the SOR.

Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 30, 2015. On July 15, 2015, she responded 
to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on September 10, 2015. 
The case was assigned to me on September 18, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on September 28, 2015. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 27, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE) 1, and 3 through 5, and 15 
Applicant exhibits (AE) A through O, were admitted into evidence without objection.3 
Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 6, 
2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. No further documents 
were submitted. The record closed on November 3, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one (¶ 1.b.)  of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s answers are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been the 
vice-president of operations and co-owner of the company since September 2005.4 She 
previously held positions with other commercial entities as a loan officer, realtor, and 
mortgage broker. As a state merit scholar and the recipient of scholarships and financial 
aid, Applicant earned a bachelor of arts degree in communications in 1993.5 She has 
never served with the U.S. military.6 She has never held a security clearance.7 Applicant 
was married in August 1996 and divorced in April 1999. She married her current 
husband in November 2003.8 She has a son born in 2005 and a daughter born in 2006.9

Financial Considerations10 
In 2006, Applicant was a licensed realtor and mortgage broker earning a good 
part-time salary that paid the bills related to her businesses and supplemented her 
husband’s income as a government contractor. Unfortunately for her husband, his 
employer paid him inconsistently and bounced checks worth an entire month’s salary. 
As the national economy fell on hard times and the real estate market collapsed, 
Applicant’s source of income decreased to zero. As mortgage restrictions increased, it 
became more difficult for her to qualify her customer base for new mortgage loans. Her 
efforts to qualify as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) lender were denied 
because she was a sole proprietor. Without a successful real estate closing for months, 
in 2008, Applicant closed her business and paid off as many of her accumulated bills as 
possible. She prioritized her accounts, and she paid her mortgage and utilities and then 
her vendors, including the companies and appraisers with whom she had been 
associated. The remaining resources were used to address existing credit card debts 
and routine household expenses. In 2009, Applicant and her husband separated for a 
brief period, and debt payments ceased. They reconciled and Applicant joined her 
husband and began to work full-time and things improved financially. Prior to 2010, 
Applicant’s credit score was in the mid-700’s, and although she was stretched 
financially, she met all obligations and was not incurring new debt. 
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy (unofficially known as "Superstorm Sandy”) struck the 
east coast of the United States. It was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of 
the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second-costliest hurricane in United States 
history. While Applicant’s residence was spared extensive damage, the damage caused 
to the company that was their only source of income resulted in a work shut-down for 
one week. It eventually resulted in the contract being terminated over nine months early. 
That event also caused a setback in Applicant’s efforts to resolve additional debts. The 
budget sequestration in 2013 - automatic spending cuts to United States federal 
government spending in particular categories of outlays - went into effect in March 
2013. For eight months, Applicant and her husband had very little income outside of her 
husband’s monthly disability check from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
for $450 or $500, plus any money he could generate by repairing computers. They 
struggled to meet their financial obligations by juggling their bills, but were in constant 
contact with their creditors. Nevertheless, accounts became delinquent, and many were 
charged off. Despite it all, Applicant never considered bankruptcy as an option. 
Repayment agreements were finally established for some of the accounts. Applicant 
and her husband sold their residence and relocated into an apartment in another state. 
With their company returning to profitability in 2014 (she estimated they made $100,000

in 2014, and projected an estimated $130,000 to $140,000 for 2015), Applicant started 
addressing her remaining delinquent accounts.11 
The SOR identified nine purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, as reflected by the June 2014 credit report,12 the November 
2014 credit report,13 and the June 2015 credit report.14 Those debts (several of which 
were no longer legally collectable because the statute of limitations had already 
expired), totaling approximately $71,487, and their respective current status, according 
to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a line of credit with a credit limit of $2,500 and an unpaid 
balance of $2,503 that was charged off and eventually settled with a payment of 
$2,047.24 on October 7, 2015.15 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a secured second mortgage account with a high credit of 
$38,540 of which $25,797 was charged off and eventually settled in full on May 2, 2015, 
after the residence was sold in April 2015, before the SOR was issued.16 The account 
has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a credit card account with a high credit and unpaid balance 
of $924 that was charged off and eventually settled with a payment of $554.87 on 
October 13, 2015.17 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a credit card account opened during Applicant’s first 
marriage with a credit limit of $5,400 and an unpaid balance of $5,662 that was charged 
off and eventually settled with a payment of $3,397.62 on October 13, 2015.18 The 
account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $13,300 and an 
unpaid balance of $14,302 that was charged off and eventually settled with a payment 
of $3,200 on October 9, 2015.19 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $4,500 and an 
unpaid balance of $5,647 that was charged off and eventually settled with a payment of 
$1,500 on October 9, 2015.20 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $11,700 and 
an unpaid balance of $11,813 that was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser and 
eventually settled with a payment of $3,545 on October 2, 2015.21 The account has 
been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is a department store charge account with an unpaid balance 
of $1,723 that was charged off. Although Applicant initially proffered evidence that the 
account had been paid, she changed her explanation to state that the account had been 
closed in such a manner that payments could not be accepted, and that the creditor 
considered the account closed with a zero balance. She submitted a document from a 
collection agency claiming that an account identified in the document had a zero 
balance and was closed. Applicant’s explanations are in error. The identity of the bank 
that issued the department store charge account (Citibank) and the bank identified in 
the document (Chase) are different. The original account numbers are different. There 
is no evidence to reflect that the accounts were affiliated in any way. Applicant also had 
a delinquent account with Chase that was not alleged in the SOR, but which was listed 
in her credit reports. The two accounts are not the same.22 While Applicant may have 
intended to resolve this account, the account in the SOR has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $2,900 and an 
unpaid balance of $3,116 that was charged off and eventually settled with a payment of 
$1,246.55 on September 18, 2015.23 The account has been resolved. 
In October 2015, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement that listed 
their combined net monthly income as $6,475; monthly expenses of $4,140; two credit 
card payments of $475; and a monthly remainder of $1,860 available for discretionary 
saving or spending.24 She received financial counseling on setting financial goals and

creating a budget in October 2015.25 She has made substantial process in resolving her 
delinquent accounts, including at least one that was not alleged in the SOR. It appears 
that Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly, and that her financial 
problems are finally under control.  
Character References 
 Various professional and personal individuals have known Applicant for a 
number of years and they characterize her as a diligent worker, committed mother, 
responsible, trustworthy, reliable, generous, compassionate, kind, honest, great moral 
character, ethical, helpful, loyal, dedicated, and possessing integrity.26 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”27 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”28   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”29 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.30  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”31 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”32 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2008, increased in 
2012, and substantially increased in 2013. Accounts became delinquent and they were 
placed for collection and charged off. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”33  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by her personal frivolous or irresponsible spending. Also, it does not 
appear that she spent beyond her means. Instead, her financial problems initially 
occurred when the national economy and the associated housing market collapsed, 
events that were largely beyond her control. Her income from her businesses as a 
                                                          
33
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

licensed realtor and mortgage broker essentially evaporated. She closed those 
businesses, prioritized her bills, and paid off as many of her accumulated debts as 
possible. Her brief separation from her husband caused additional stress. The climate 
events of 2012 – Superstorm Sandy – caused devastation to the business in which she 
and her husband worked. There was a work shut-down for one week, followed by the 
early termination of their only contract, again a situation that was largely beyond her 
control. The political and economic events of 2013 – the budget sequestration – shut 
down their business, and for eight months, they managed to financially survive with very 
little income aside from her husband’s monthly modest disability check. Applicant 
maintained contact with her creditors.  
 
Finally, the financial situation improved when the company returned to 
profitability in 2014 and 2015. Of the nine delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, one 
was resolved before the SOR was issued, and seven others were resolved shortly 
before the hearing was held. One delinquent SOR-related account was apparently 
overlooked when Applicant resolved another delinquent account that was not alleged in 
the SOR. As to the remaining delinquent account, once the error of her actions is 
brought to her attention by this decision, I am confident that she will turn her attention to 
resolving that relatively minor debt ($1,723) as well. It is significant that although the 
statute of limitations had apparently expired for most of the accounts, meaning that 
there was no legal enforcement mechanism to require that Applicant pay those debts, 
she chose to do so. It appears that Applicant’s financial status has improved 
significantly, and that her financial problems are finally under control. She appears to 
have acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances 
confronting her, no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.34 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration

of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.35       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain her normal monthly payments to a number of her accounts, and, over a 
several-year period, at least nine of them became delinquent and were placed for 
collection and charged-off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling 
protected information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant was a licensed 
realtor and mortgage broker earning a good part-time salary in 2006. However, a series 
of events that were largely beyond her control occurred in 2008 (the collapse of the 
national economy and the real estate market), in 2009 (her separation from her 
spouse), 2012 (Superstorm Sandy), and 2013 (sequestration), all of which contributed 
to her financial difficulties. Applicant did not ignore her delinquent debts. Instead, when 
she was financially able, she entered into repayment agreements with her creditors, and 
paid off or otherwise resolved all but one of her SOR-related debts, as well as one debt 
that was not listed in the SOR. There are no other delinquent debts. Considering the 
current profitability of the company, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no

requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 36 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and she started to do so before the SOR was issued. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
