Decision 
___________ 
 
Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol consumption, and at times the 
magnitude of his alcohol consumption was excessive. He abstained from alcohol 
consumption for 4½ years and he promised to continue to abstain from alcohol 
consumption. Applicant made four security-related false statements from May 24, 2012, 
to July 28, 2015, about his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security 
concerns are mitigated; however, personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. 
Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On May 24, 2012, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire 
for National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 28, 2016, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to 
Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective 
on September 1, 2006.   
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
 
2 
                                         
 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines G (alcohol 
consumption) and E (personal conduct).  
 
On April 22, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. On May 18, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 18, 2016, the case was assigned to 
me. On August 11, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing, setting the hearing for September 7, 2016. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing 
was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered 
six exhibits; and all exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Transcript 
(Tr.) 13-15; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4; Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-F) Department 
Counsel also offered a letter indicating discovery was provided to Applicant, which was 
admitted without objection. (Tr. 12; HE 4) On September 15, 2016, DOHA received a 
copy of the transcript of the hearing.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.c. He 
admitted some facts in each of the other SOR allegations, and he denied other facts in 
each of the SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. 
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GE 1) He worked 
as a senior engineer on advanced technologies for more than 30 years and for his 
current employer more than 10 years. (Tr. 18, 20, 113; GE 1) In 1984, Applicant 
graduated from a large U.S. university, and he received a bachelor’s of science degree 
in electrical engineering. (Tr. 18, GE 1) In 1986, Applicant married, and in 1989, he 
divorced. (Tr. 112) He does not have any children. (Tr. 112) He never served in the U.S. 
military. (Tr. 112) He has held a security clearance since 1984, and there is no evidence 
of security violations. (Tr. 19) 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
The SOR alleges: in 1989 or 1990, Applicant received alcohol treatment and was 
diagnosed as alcohol dependent (¶ 1.a); in 1996, he relapsed and resumed his alcohol 
consumption (¶ 1.b); between 2007 and March 2012, he drank alcohol throughout the 
day including during work days (¶ 1.c); and Applicant’s supervisor confronted Applicant 
about his alcohol consumption and allowed Applicant to take time off from work to 
attend an alcohol-treatment program; however, Applicant did not attend an alcohol-
treatment program (¶ 1.d).  
 
Applicant has consumed alcohol with lengthy periods of sobriety for more than 30 
years. (Tr. 20-21) In the 1980s, he drank about a half-gallon of vodka on a weekend day 
and a fifth of vodka almost every night during the week. (Tr. 109; GE 3 at 2) He had 
 
3 
                                         
 
memory blackouts from his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 110) In 1984, Applicant consumed 
more than 20 drinks in a 12-hour period and drove his vehicle. (Tr. 62; GE 3 at 1) He 
was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Tr. 62; GE 3 at 1) He 
refused a breathalyzer test. (GE 3 at 2) He pleaded guilty to DUI; he received probation 
before judgment; and he was sentenced to a fine and probation for 12 months. (GE 1; 
GE 3 at 2)  
 
In 1989, Applicant was abusing codeine and excessively drinking alcohol, and 
the police arrested him for attempting to purchase narcotics. (Tr. 21, 62; GE 1) The last 
time he abused an illegal drug was in 1989. (Tr. 25) In 1989 or 1990, Applicant came to 
work hungover and smelling of alcohol, and his company suggested or requested that 
he obtain treatment for substance abuse. (Tr. 27-28) He received 30 days of 
detoxification. (Tr. 21) After his inpatient treatment, he went to Alcoholics Anonymous 
(AA) meetings. (Tr. 110) He did not recall being diagnosed as alcohol dependent. (Tr. 
30) The inpatient treatment records and diagnosis from the program are not part of the 
record evidence. Applicant was sober for one year. In 1990, he was under stress, and 
he resumed his alcohol consumption, and he became intoxicated. (Tr. 21, 63-65) He 
recognized the negative effects of excessive alcohol consumption, and he resumed 
sobriety for several years. (Tr. 22) He said he went to AA meetings “maybe once a 
week . . . until sometime in the 2000’s.” (Tr. 64) He stopped routinely attending AA 
meetings around 2005; however, from 2005 to 2012, he occasionally attended AA 
meetings. (Tr. 95) He resumed frequent AA attendance on March 15, 2012. (Tr. 95)  
 
In 2002, Applicant’s dog died, and Applicant drank alcohol to intoxication. (Tr. 22, 
65, 94) Applicant gradually increased his alcohol consumption, and by 2008, he was 
drinking alcohol every weekend. (Tr. 23) He continued to increase the frequency of his 
alcohol consumption, and by 2011 or 2012, he was drinking alcohol every day. (Tr. 23, 
70-71) Sometimes he started drinking alcohol shortly after waking in the morning. (Tr. 
70) When he drank alcohol during the duty day, it was during lunch or after he was done 
working for the day. (Tr. 38) He denied that: he was drunk at work; he drank alcohol at 
the office; and he drove to the office after drinking. (Tr. 38-39, 99-100) Later in his 
hearing, he said, he could have been under the influence of alcohol, but not intoxicated, 
while he was working at home in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe. (Tr. 72, 99-100) He 
conceded that he consumed alcohol while working at home. (Tr. 38-39)  
 
On March 14, 2012, Applicant’s employer came to him and advised him that one 
of their customers did not want Applicant working on their project because of his alcohol 
consumption. (Tr. 23, 75, 118, 127) In March 2012, Applicant’s supervisor noticed the 
smell of alcohol on Applicant’s breath. (Tr. 118, 126) He confronted Applicant about 
consuming alcohol, and Applicant confessed that he had been drinking. (Tr. 118, 126-
128) Applicant’s supervisor did not believe Applicant was impaired or intoxicated in the 
office, or that he was drinking alcohol in the office. (Tr. 125, 130, 134, 137)  
 
On March 14, 2012, Applicant told his supervisor that he would take care of his 
problem. (Tr. 120, 129) His supervisor understood from a March 14, 2012 email from 
Applicant that he sought inpatient treatment and intended to go to inpatient treatment. 
(Tr. 120-123, 129-131; GE 2 at 49) When Applicant returned to work, he did not say 
 
4 
                                         
 
whether or not he received inpatient treatment, and sometime probably in 2014, 
Applicant said he went to AA meetings instead of the inpatient treatment. (Tr. 122-123, 
132-133) It was irrelevant to Applicant’s pay whether he went to AA meetings or 
inpatient alcohol treatment. (Tr. 139) Applicant’s supervisor believed Applicant has been 
sober since March 15, 2012, and Applicant’s work was outstanding after March 2012. 
(Tr. 122-124) The only requirement for Applicant to return to work was for him to end his 
alcohol consumption. 
 
Applicant said he terminated his alcohol consumption on March 15, 2012, and he 
has not consumed alcohol after March 15, 2012. (Tr. 23-24, 40, 57) He does not intend 
to consume alcohol in the future. (Tr. 57) He does not keep alcohol in his house; his 
girlfriend does not drink alcohol; and his family, friends, and employer support his 
sobriety. (Tr. 57-58; AE E) 
 
Applicant conceded that he could not handle any alcohol consumption. (Tr. 61) 
He was not able to drink responsibly or in moderation. (Tr. 61) He used AA to reinforce 
his commitment not to consume alcohol. (Tr. 61) 
 
Applicant provided a written statement of his intention “never to abuse alcohol in 
the future and consent[ed] to automatic revocation of his security clearance should 
there be any violation with regard to alcohol use.” (Tr. 59; AE D) Applicant explained 
that he understood this commitment to mean that if he resumed alcohol consumption 
his security clearance would be revoked. (Tr. 59-60) 
 
A licensed psychologist described Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption as 
indicated in the SOR and related by Applicant; however, it did not detail the magnitude 
of his alcohol consumption in the 1980s. (AE A) The psychologist diagnosed Applicant 
with “Alcohol Use Disorder, in remission with four years sobriety,” and he concluded 
there was a “low risk of relapse.” (AE A at 9, 11) A licensed clinical alcohol and drug 
counselor said he had a low risk of relapse and did not recommend any education or 
treatment for his alcohol use. (AE B) Applicant’s AA sponsor described Applicant’s 
active participation in AA and considered him to be trustworthy, diligent, loyal, and 
honest. (AE C) 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his arrest in 1989 for attempted 
possession of a narcotic on his 2002 SCA because he was worried about losing his 
employment if he disclosed the information; however, this falsification of his SCA was 
not listed in his SOR.1 (Tr. 62, 97-98; GE 1 at 45-46; GE 3 at 4)  
                                            
1Applicant’s SOR does not allege that in 1984, he drove his vehicle while intoxicated; in 1989, he 
was arrested for attempted possession of a narcotic; in 2002, he intentionally provided false information in 
his 2002 SCA about his arrest for attempted possession of a narcotic, and he was not truthful and candid 
at his hearing about his state of mind when he made four security-related false statements from May 24, 
2012 to July 28, 2015 about his history of alcohol consumption. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR 
may be considered stating:  
 
5 
                                         
 
Applicant’s Four Statements Denying Alcohol Consumption from 1996 to 2002 
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant made four false security-related statements from 
May 24, 2012, to July 28, 2015, about his alcohol consumption from 1996 to 2002 as 
follows: in his May 24, 2012 SCA (¶ 2.b); during his June 25, 2012 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) (¶ 2.c); during his March 25, 2014 
OPM PSI (¶ 2.e); and in his July 28, 2015 response to DOHA interrogatories (¶ 2.f).  
 
On March 20, 2002, Applicant provided a handwritten sworn statement to a 
Defense Security Service representative. Applicant stated that from 1991 to 2002, he 
did not consume alcohol. (Tr. 31; GE 3) He described his alcohol use between 1996 
and 2002 as follows: 
 
I purchased a ½ pint of vodka on the day I moved into a new house . . . 
with my girlfriend in 1991. Other than this I did not consume alcohol again 
until 1996. Between 1996 and now I have consumed alcohol in very 
limited amounts in certain social settings. I have dinners with my friends 
each week and have probably consumed about three beers or less per 
month since 1996. I do not believe I have an alcohol problem at the 
present time. (Tr. 22, 24, 32; GE 3 at 6) 
 
In Applicant’s May 24, 2012 SCA, he said he was sober for 17 years from 1990 
to about 2007 (indicating in his SCA that he resumed alcohol consumption five years 
before completing his SCA). (GE 1 at 35, 39-41; SOR ¶ 2.b) On June 25, 2012, 
Applicant told an OPM investigator that he stopped drinking after completing the 
treatment program in 1990 “and stayed completely sober from drugs and alcohol until 
2007.” (GE 2 at 6; SOR ¶ 2.c) On March 25, 2014, Applicant told an OPM investigator 
that from approximately 1990 to 2007, “he abstained from alcohol and drugs 
completely.” (Tr. 68; GE 2 at 14; SOR ¶ 2.e) In Applicant’s July 28, 2015 response to 
DOHA interrogatories, he verified the accuracy of the OPM interviews of June 25, 2012, 
and March 25, 2014, and he reiterated his claim that he had 17 years of sobriety. (GE 2 
at 21, 25, 28) When he completed his DOHA interrogatories, he made changes to the 
OPM interview; however, he did not change his statement that he was completely 
abstinent from alcohol consumption from 1990 to 2007. (Tr. 69) He described his failure 
to change the OPM summary as “my oversight.” (Tr. 69) 
 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Applicant’s non-SOR conduct will not be considered for disqualification purposes, and 
consideration will be limited to the five circumstances outlined by the appeal board.  
 
6 
                                         
 
Applicant said he did not remember drinking from 1996 to 2002 until he reviewed 
his March 20, 2002 statement, which refreshed his recollection about occasionally 
consuming alcohol from 1996 to 2002. (Tr. 35-36) Later he said: 
 
Well, I was thinking it was in terms of I didn’t get drunk. I wasn’t a drinking 
person as like regularly going out and drinking. I had these isolated 
incidents which you just mentioned. But I felt like for the most part I was 
sober every day, you know. . . . Yes, there could be maybe six days that 
you can find over those 17 years [1990 to 2007] . . . when I – or three days 
or where I was intoxicated then. (Tr. 65-66)  
 
Because Applicant continued to occasionally drink alcohol in the 1990s, his AA 
sober date moved dozens of times, and he just took a “one day badge” to show the 
period of sobriety. (Tr. 66, 99) He explained the discrepancy about forgetting that he 
consumed alcohol in the 1990s as follows: “How I forgot them, no, I knew I was drinking 
then, but I just didn’t realize that they were in that period in ’95 to -- ’96 to ’99. I thought 
they started in 2002.” From 1996 to 2002, Applicant said the most that he drank in any 
month was three beers, and there were some months that he did not drink any alcohol. 
(Tr. 69-70) He said three or four times a year, he would gather with friends and drink a 
beer or two. (Tr. 70) Later he said he drank about six beers a year for those six years. 
(Tr. 94)   
 
Applicant contended that his failure to provide accurate information as alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, 2.e, and 2.f, was due to a memory lapse and not deliberate and 
intentional. (Tr. 36-37; AE F)  
 
Applicant’s Statements to his Employer about Inpatient Alcohol Treatment in 
March 2012 
 
The SOR alleges in ¶ 2.a that in March 2012, Applicant falsely told his employer 
that he attended a five-day alcohol-treatment program.  
 
On March 14, 2012, Applicant’s employer confronted him about his alcohol 
consumption and provided him an insurance pamphlet about health care treatment for 
addictions and alcohol treatment. (Tr. 40-43, 76, 84, 89; SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 2 at 35) 
Applicant called the number in the pamphlet and the insurance company advised him 
that the insurance company did not recommend specific programs. (Tr. 84) He had to 
find the program he wished to attend, and then the program was supposed to contact 
the insurance company for a coverage decision. (Tr. 84) Applicant did some research 
during the early afternoon on March 14, 2012, and he checked with a facility and 
thought he would be able to enroll as an inpatient for five days. (Tr. 42-45, 76-79; GE 2 
at 51) On March 14, 2012, at 5:27 PM, he told his supervisor in an email that he would 
not be available to assist on a project, until he would be out of inpatient treatment on the 
following Tuesday (six days later). (Tr. 50-51, 79; GE 2 at 49) After he told his 
supervisor he planned to enroll in inpatient treatment, on March 14, 2012, he learned 
that he was unable to enroll in a five-day detoxification program, and instead, he elected 
to attend AA meetings. (Tr. 42-46, 77-78) He attended multiple AA meetings each day 
 
7 
                                         
 
over the period March 15-19, 2012 (He was off from work those five days). (Tr. 43, 47, 
52) He never told his supervisor or anyone else at work that he actually attended an 
inpatient treatment program in March 2012. (Tr. 47, 52, 82-85) He told his supervisor 
that he attended AA meetings over the period March 15-19, 2012. (Tr. 52) He continued 
to attend AA meetings after March 2012. (Tr. 47)  
 
Applicant denied that he was told his clearance was revoked until he completed 
inpatient treatment. (Tr. 40-43, 82-85) In order to get his clearance reinstated, Applicant 
told his supervisor that he was sober, and he was attending AA meetings. (Tr. 86)     
 
Applicant’s Statements about Inpatient Alcohol Treatment in March 2012 to an 
OPM Investigator 
 
The SOR alleges in ¶ 2.d and Applicant admitted that he that falsely told an OPM 
investigator on March 25, 2014, that he attended inpatient treatment at a specific 
treatment center in March 2012. Applicant said he became flustered and panicky during 
the OPM interview when he was asked about inpatient treatment. (Tr. 54-55) He made 
up the name of a treatment center and lied about the receipt of inpatient alcohol 
treatment. (Tr. 55-56) The same day that he lied to the OPM investigator, Applicant 
called the investigator and told her that he lied about receiving inpatient treatment in 
2012. (Tr. 55-56) He said this was the only instance he intentionally provided false 
information. (Tr. 57) Later in his hearing, he acknowledged that he deliberately provided 
false information on his 2002 SCA when he denied his arrest for attempted possession 
of drugs. (Tr. 62-63, 97-98)   
  
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor described his work performance as outstanding with an 
excellent reputation among his peers and customers at the personal appearance and in 
a written statement. (Tr. 117, 124; AE E) He recommended that Applicant retain his 
security clearance. (Tr. 126) 
 
 In addition to the statement from his supervisor, Applicant provided seven 
character letters from friends, his facility security officer, and coworkers some of whom 
have known him for decades. (AE E) The general sense of their statements is that 
Applicant is honest, diligent, reliable, responsible, loyal, professional, competent, and 
dedicated. (AE E)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
 
8 
                                         
 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the concern about alcohol consumption, “[e]xcessive alcohol 
consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to 
control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and 
trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) through 22(g) provides:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 2 
                                            
2In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the first of a series of Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manuals of Mental Disorders. In 2000, the APA published the DSM–IV–TR. The criteria for 
“alcohol abuse” and “alcohol dependence” in AG ¶ 22 are drawn from the DSM-IV-TR, which was in effect 
when the Adjudicative Guidelines were issued in 2006. In May 2013, the APA issued the 5th edition of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5).The criteria in DSM-IV-TR for alcohol 
dependence and in DSM-5 for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are objective, well established, and rely 
primarily on self-reports and descriptions. DSM–5 integrates the two DSM–IV disorders, alcohol abuse 
and alcohol dependence, into a single disorder called alcohol use disorder (AUD) with mild, moderate, 
and severe sub-classifications. DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 are used throughout the medical and legal 
communities to determine alcohol dependence and AUD severe, which have the same criteria. AUD-
moderate overlaps with both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. The DSM-5 notes that, “early 
remission from a DSM-5 substance use disorder is defined as at least 3 but less than 12 months without 
substance use disorder criteria (except craving), and sustained remission is defined as at least 12 months 
without criteria (except craving).” Additionally the new DSM-5 includes “in a controlled environment” and 
“on maintenance therapy” as the situation warrants. The alcohol consumption guideline does not 
incorporate DSM remission criteria and leaves mitigation to a case-by-case determination. See National  
Institute of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism website, “Alcohol Use Disorder: A 
Comparison Between DSM–IV and DSM–5 http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/dsmfactsheet/dsm

(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(d) through 22(g) do not apply. There was no evidence of: alcohol 
impairment or intoxication at work; an alcohol dependence diagnosis; relapse after a 
diagnosis of alcohol dependence; and failure to follow any court orders.  
 
AG ¶¶ 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c) apply. In 1984, Applicant was arrested for and 
pleaded guilty to DUI. He engaged in binge alcohol consumption to the extent of 
impaired judgment.3 He admitted that he consumed alcohol while he was working at 
home.   
  
  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-23(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has

3Although the term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Directive, the generally accepted 
definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two hours.
 
The 
definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 
NIAAA Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), http://www.pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/ 
winter2004/NewsletterNumber3.pdf.

demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶ 23(b) applies. On March 15, 2012, Applicant ended his alcohol 
consumption, and he attended numerous AA meetings each week to reinforce his 
abstinence. Applicant is credited with continuing to attend AA meetings after his security 
clearance was suspended, and his security clearance was reinstated.     
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of 
substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless 
there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR 
Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).     
 
I have carefully considered the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption, Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption, his six-year period of alcohol 
abstinence from 1991 to 1996, his 4½ years of alcohol abstinence from March 15, 2012, 
to his hearing on September 7, 2016, support from his friends, coworkers, and AA 
sponsor, and his sincere commitment to continued alcohol abstinence. He has a 
“sustained period of remission” under DSM-5 because he has more than 12 months of 
abstinence. See note 2, supra. He has not had any alcohol-related incidents involving 
the police, courts, or at his employment since March 14, 2012. Applicant has eliminated 
doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment in relation to his 
alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated.   
 
 
12 
                                         
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;4 and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
Applicant made four security-related false statements from May 24, 2012, to July 
28, 2015, when he claimed that he did not consume alcohol from 1990 until 2007 
because he periodically drank alcohol from 1996 and March 2002. The four false 
statements were made as follows: in his May 24, 2012 SCA (SOR ¶ 2.b); during his 
June 25, 2012 OPM PSI (SOR ¶ 2.c); during his March 25, 2014 OPM PSI (SOR ¶ 2.e); 
and in his July 28, 2015 response to DOHA interrogatories (SOR ¶ 2.f). AG ¶¶ 16(a) 
and 16(b) are established in regard to SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, 2.e, and 2.f. 
 
The SOR alleges that in March 2012, he provided false information to his 
employer that he attended a five-day alcohol-treatment program (¶ 2.a). This allegation 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
13 
                                         
 
is not substantiated. Applicant expressed his intention to attend the treatment program; 
however, he was not permitted to enroll for a five-day treatment program, and he 
elected not to enroll. He did not lie to his employer about attendance in the five-day 
treatment program. 
 
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges and the record establishes that he falsely told an OPM 
investigator on March 25, 2014, that he attended inpatient treatment at a specific 
treatment center in March 2012. AG ¶ 16(b) applies to SOR ¶ 2.d. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶ 17(a) applies to SOR ¶ 2.d. The evening after Applicant lied to the OPM 
investigator on March 25, 2014, about attendance at an inpatient treatment at a specific 
treatment center in March 2012, he told the OPM investigator that he had lied, and he 
provided correct information. 
 
 
14 
                                         
 
None of the mitigating conditions apply to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c, 2.e, 
and 2.f. Applicant admitted that the statements made on his 2012 SCA, during his 2012 
and 2014 OPM PSIs, and his 2015 DOHA interrogatories about not consuming alcohol 
from 1996 to 2007 were incorrect, and he did in fact use alcohol on several occasions 
during that time period. He claimed his incorrect statements were due to memory lapses 
and not deliberate lies. Alternatively, he claimed that his alcohol consumption was so 
minimal that it did not show a lack of sobriety, or words to that effect. His claims of 
memory lapses or that his false statements were unintentional are not credible. He 
attended AA meetings from 1996 to 2007, and he had to repeatedly recalculate his 
sobriety date. Moreover forgetting about alcohol consumption over such a long period is 
not credible, especially when the issue of alcohol consumption has had such a profound 
influence on his life over his 30-plus year history of alcohol consumption.      
 
The protection of national security relies upon the honesty of security clearance 
holders, and their willingness to self-report information, even when disclosure reflects 
poorly on the security clearance holder. Personal conduct security concerns are not 
mitigated.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked as 
a senior engineer on advanced technologies for more than 30 years and for his current 
employer more than 10 years. In 1984, Applicant graduated from a large U.S. university, 
and he received a bachelor’s of science degree in electrical engineering. Applicant is 
credited with 4½ years of abstinence from alcohol consumption and with promising to 
continue his sobriety. The general sense of Applicant’s eight character statements is 
that Applicant is honest, diligent, reliable, responsible, loyal, professional, competent, 
 
15 
                                         
 
and dedicated. Their statements support approval of his security clearance. He has held 
a security clearance since 1984. There are no allegations of violations of security rules. 
 
The factors weighing against continuation of his security clearance are more 
substantial than the mitigating circumstances. Applicant made four security-related false 
statements from May 24, 2012, to July 28, 2015. He falsely claimed in his SCA, his two 
OPM PSIs, and in his DOHA interrogatories that he did not consume alcohol from 1990 
until 2007. He periodically drank alcohol from 1996 and March 2002. His four false 
statements were made deliberately and with intent to deceive security officials. His 
hearing statement that he did not deliberately make incorrect statements or that he 
forgot about his alcohol consumption was not credible because of his attendance at AA 
meetings and his concession that he moved his sober date dozens of times, and he just 
took a “one day badge.” His false statements are serious and relatively recent.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated; however, personal 
conduct security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  For Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.e and 2.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.g:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
