MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
On December 8, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that 
his circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations 
guideline.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing to establish his 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
 On September 22, 2016, I convened a hearing. After receipt of the transcript and 
the record closed, I provided written notice to the parties of my intent to resolve the case 
through a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department Counsel indicated that 
the Government did not object to my proposed resolution of the matter in this fashion. 
See Appellate Exhibit I.  
 
 Applicant mitigated security concerns raised by his past financial problems and 
met his heavy burden of persuasion for access to classified information. His past 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

financial problems were primarily attributable to matters beyond his control, namely, 
periods of unstable employment and his wife's serious medical issue (cancer). After 
falling behind on some debts, Applicant attempted to modify his mortgage. The creditor 
kept changing hands and losing his modification paperwork, exacerbating his already 
troubled financial situation. Applicant satisfied his delinquent home mortgage through an 
agreed-upon short sale. As of the close of the record, Applicant had satisfied or 
otherwise resolved all the SOR debts, except the debt listed in SOR 1.h. He has been 
paying this debt through an agreed-upon payment plan that was established in about 
December 2015. He has been making consistent monthly payments and will finish 
paying off the debt in less than one year.  
 
In addition to responsibly addressing the SOR debts, Applicant also 
demonstrated that he currently manages his finances in a responsible manner. Notably, 
he reduced his expenses by moving from his home to a modest apartment with a 
monthly rental cost that is nearly half his previous monthly mortgage payments. His 
children have all moved out of the house except for his one minor child. This change in 
circumstances has permitted Applicant to further reduce his monthly expenses. His 
current job situation is stable. His wife has returned to full-time employment, and her 
cancer is in full remission. Applicant and his wife together earn nearly $200,000. After a 
thorough review of the record evidence, I find that the mitigating conditions listed at AG 
¶¶ 20(a) – 20(d) apply.  
 
The security concerns over Applicant’s history of financial problems do not create 
doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect 
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice 
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I 
conclude that Applicant met his burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
