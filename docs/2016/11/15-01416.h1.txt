Tuider, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven delinquent debts and a 
dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. She did not provide sufficient mitigating information 
about her approximately $100,000 debt resulting from her repossessed recreational 
vehicle and the status of her timeshare. With a monthly income of $11,000, she and her 
husband had sufficient financial resources to establish payment plans for these two 
debts. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 14, 2012, Applicant signed and submitted a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions version of a security clearance application (SF-86). On September 
17, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s access to classified 
information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.   
 
On October 20, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. On February 
3, 2016, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On April 13, 2016, the case 
was initially assigned to another administrative judge; however, on May 4, 2016, it was 
reassigned to me. On May 19, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for June 10, 2016. Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered 3 exhibits into evidence, 
and Applicant offered 12 exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 10-13; GE 1-3; AE A-L) All exhibits 
were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 13) On June 17, 2016, DOHA 
received the transcript of the hearing. On July 8, 2016, the record was closed. (Tr. 61-
62) No post-hearing evidence was received.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she made some admissions about the SOR 
allegations. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 72-year-old investigator doing background investigations for 
security clearances. (Tr. 11, 15; GE 1) Applicant began her federal service as a GS-3. 
In 2003, she retired from DOD employment as a GS-14 Step 7 or 8 financial support 
and program manager after 30 years of government employment, and she has worked 
continuously for a defense contractor thereafter to the present. (Tr. 12-15, 53; AE L) 
She graduated from high school, and she did not receive a college degree. (Tr. 12) In 
1966, she married her current spouse, and her three children are ages 45, 48, and 54. 
(Tr. 14)  
 
Applicant’s husband is a veteran of the Vietnam War; he served in the Army for 
22 years; and he retired with 20 years of U.S. government service. (AE L) In 2016, her 
husband will be 70 years old. (Tr. 16) She held a security clearance since 1984. (Tr. 15-
16) There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, SOR 
response, hearing transcript, and hearing exhibits. Applicant and her husband have 
about $11,000 in monthly income. (Tr. 16, 43; AE C) Applicant and her husband helped 
their children with their mortgages and school debts. (Tr. 26) In 2007, Applicant and her 
husband moved to a different state, and Applicant’s husband’s annual income

decreased by about $100,000. (Tr. 29, 39) He did not have employment in the new 
state. (Tr. 41) They built a house in the new state for $445,000 with a monthly payment 
of more than $3,000. (Tr. 41-42) Applicant had medical problems which required back 
surgery. (Tr. 30) She did not describe the costs of medical expenses or indicate she did 
not receive pay while recovering from the surgery. 
 
In October 2010, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, and in September 2011, her bankruptcy was dismissed. (Tr. 17; SOR 
¶ 1.a response; AE F) Her bankruptcy documentation listed numerous creditors; 
however, the amount owed to each creditor was not part of the record evidence. (AE F) 
On February 2, 2016, she received financial counseling, which met the legal standards 
for bankruptcy counseling. (Tr. 27; AE B) Applicant provided a personal financial 
statement, and she has a monthly remainder of $3,842.  (AE C) She said she elected to 
have the bankruptcy dismissed because she wanted to settle the debts as she was 
contacted by her creditors. (Tr. 38) When the bankruptcy was dismissed, the trustee 
sent letters to all of the creditors letting them know the bankruptcy was dismissed; 
however, Applicant did not take the initiative to contact her creditors or attempt to 
resume payments to her creditors. (Tr. 38, 50-51) After the bankruptcy was dismissed in 
2011, she and her husband purchased new cars. (Tr. 44)  
 
Applicant acknowledged her responsibility for a bank debt for $201,538 relating 
to her motor home. (Tr. 17-18; SOR ¶ 1.b) In 2004, she and her husband purchased a 
recreational vehicle for about $190,000, and the monthly payment was about $1,000. 
(Tr. 40) Applicant returned the motor home to the creditor and wanted to know how 
much credit she received for returning the motor home to the creditor. (Tr. 18) At an 
unspecified date, she called the creditor and learned the difference between the sale 
price of the motor home and the debt was $114,000. (Tr. 20) In February 2016, 
Applicant wrote the creditor asking for information about the debt, and on March 3, 
2016, the creditor replied and provided a copy of the installment contract pertaining to 
this debt. (Tr. 18, 37; AE H) The creditor did not waive collection of the debt; however, 
the creditor has not sought additional payments from Applicant. (AE H) In any event, the 
creditor has not provided enough information for Applicant to resolve this debt. (Tr. 19-
20) Nevertheless, Applicant considered the debt to be resolved. (Tr. 20) She said she 
had sufficient funds to make payments on the debt if it resurfaces. (Tr. 49) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $3,146, which pertains to the purchase 
of furniture. On February 16, 2016, the creditor wrote that collection efforts have 
terminated. (Tr. 20-21; AE G) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a charged-off bank debt for $234. On October 13, 2011, a 
collection company wrote seeking payment of $234 from Applicant. (Tr. 21; AE E) On 
February 22, 2015, Applicant paid the creditor $234, and this debt is resolved. (Tr. 21-
22; AE E) On September 9, 2014, and on October 9, 2014, the creditor bank in SOR ¶ 
1.d provided Form 1099-Cs indicating debts for $1,753 and $1,715 were discharged. 
(AE A)

SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off debt for $149 owed to a store. On February 22, 
2016, Applicant paid the creditor $149, and this debt is resolved. (Tr. 22; AE E) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a charged-off bank debt for $23,000. Applicant said she wrote 
the creditor asking about the account. (Tr. 23) On February 28, 2016, the creditor wrote 
the debt was sold to a specific debt collection company, and the creditor provided the 
telephone number for the collection company. (Tr. 33; AE I) There is no evidence of 
record that Applicant contacted the entity collecting the debt or made any effort to 
resolve the debt. Applicant said, “I have no place to pay that money. No, I do not owe 
that.” (Tr. 23-24)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a delinquent bank debt for $21,900. Applicant said she wrote 
the creditor asking about the account. (Tr. 24) Applicant said the debt was settled, and a 
September 16, 2013 Form 1099-C from a collection agent indicated $6,566 from a 
bankcard was discharged. (Tr. 24-25; AE A) On February 20, 2016, the creditor wrote 
that the debt was not being reported by the creditor to the three largest credit reporting 
companies, and the creditor confirmed the debt was not reported on their reports. (Tr. 
31-32; AE J) A May 31, 2012 Form 1099-C from a collection agent for the creditor bank 
in SOR ¶ 1.g indicates a debt for $21,924 was discharged. (AE A) Applicant said she 
declared the income indicated on the Form 1099-Cs on her federal income tax returns. 
(Tr. 52)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a debt on a time share for $523. Applicant said she 
relinquished the timeshare, and she believes the debt is satisfied. (Tr. 25) There is no 
evidence of record that the debt is resolved. 
 
Character Evidence 
 
A retired colonel, who has worked with Applicant since 1995; a retired military 
intelligence officer, who has known Applicant since 1992; an intelligence officer, who 
worked with Applicant when she was a DOD employee; and her neighbor for 5 ½ years, 
described Applicant’s excellent work performance, conscientious compliance with rules, 
professionalism, competence, trustworthiness, and honesty. (Tr. 32-35; AE K) Their 
statements support continuation of Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE K) 
There is no evidence of reportable arrests or convictions, or abuse of illegal drugs or 
alcohol. (GE 1) 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports, SOR response, hearing transcript, and hearing exhibits. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant presented some mitigating information. Several circumstances beyond 
her control adversely affected her finances. Applicant and her husband helped their 
children with their mortgages and school debts. In 2007, Applicant and her husband 
moved to a different state, and Applicant’s husband’s annual income decreased by 
about $100,000 because he did not have employment in the new state. Applicant had 
medical problems which required back surgery. Applicant received financial counseling 
and generated a budget. Full mitigating credit is not available because they did not 
establish that the move to a different state without obtaining employment in the new 
state first (in light of their debts) was reasonable. The cost of her back surgery was not 
provided. Moreover, she did not provide enough documentation showing that she acted 
                                            
2
The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

responsibly to address the delinquent SOR debts in ¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.h when she had 
stable employment; her monthly income was about $11,000; and her monthly remainder 
was $3,842.         
 
Applicant is credited with making payments into the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan 
and mitigating SOR ¶ 1.a. She is also credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c 
through 1.e, and 1.g. She provided proof of payments of two debts totaling about $500 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e) and multiple IRS Form 1099-Cs showing creditors had discharged 
debts. She is not credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶ 1.b (about $100,000), ¶ 1.f 
($23,000), and ¶ 1.h ($523) because she did not make sufficient documented efforts to 
resolve these three debts, there is no documentation showing progress paying these 
debts or a reasonable dispute of these debts. She conceded she owed debts to the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.h, and she did not take reasonable actions to contact the 
collection creditor handling the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f.  
 
Applicant in this case relies in part upon the absence of delinquent debts from 
her current credit report to mitigate security concerns. “[T]hat some debts have dropped 
off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR Case 
No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative 
financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the 
debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is 
longer.    
 
All states have statutes of limitations upon collectability of credit card debts, 
which range from three to six years. State statutes of limitations clearly and 
unequivocally end an Applicant’s legal responsibility to pay the creditor after the 
passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of decisions, 
the Appeal Board has rejected statutes of limitations for debts generated through 
contracts, which is the law in all 50 states, as significantly mitigating financial

Recently, the DOHA Appeal Board reinforced its position on statutes of 
limitations not mitigating financial considerations concerns stating:

In this case, the Judge noted that Applicant explained that he did not owe 
any of the alleged debts because they had either been deleted from his 
credit report or soon would be deleted, and he also relied on a state 
statute of limitations to absolve himself of debts. The Appeal Board has 
long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance 
purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the 
statute of limitations or cannot be legally listed on a credit report due to the 
passage of time. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 
20, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).4 We 
also have held that reliance on a state’s statute of limitations does not 
constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited 
mitigative value. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) and ISCR 
Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003)). 
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). 
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
documented progress resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b (about $100,000 on her 
repossessed recreational vehicle), 1.f ($23,000 on a bank debt), and 1.h ($523 on her 
time share contract). She did not make a sufficient effort to document settlement or 
investigation of these SOR debts. There is not enough assurance that her financial 
problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all 
the circumstances, she failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns 
are mitigated. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

 Compare ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2014). In that case, Applicant corroborated 
efforts to settle debts that were in “charged-off” status. Also, that Applicant had received financial 
counseling. Ultimately, the Board affirmed the Judge’s favorable decision.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 72-year-old investigator doing background investigations for 
security clearances. Applicant began her federal service as a GS-3 and rose to be a 
GS-14 Step 7 or 8 program manager after 30 years of government employment. She 
has experience as a financial support officer working for DOD. From 2003 to the 
present, she has worked continuously for a defense contractor. She held a security 
clearance since 1984. There is no evidence of security violations. She is sufficiently 
mature to conscientiously comply with her security responsibilities.    
 
A retired colonel, a retired military intelligence officer, an intelligence officer, and 
her neighbor for 5 ½ years, described Applicant’s excellent work performance, 
conscientious compliance with rules, professionalism, competence, trustworthiness, and 
honesty. Their statements support continuation of Applicant’s access to classified 
information. There is no evidence of reportable arrests or convictions, or abuse of illegal 
drugs or alcohol.  
 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance for Applicant is more 
persuasive. There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make 
greater documented progress resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b (about $100,000 on her 
repossessed recreational vehicle), 1.f ($23,000 bank debt), and 1.h ($523 on her time 
share contract). Applicant has a lengthy history of delinquent debt. The debt arising 
from repossession of her RV has been delinquent for several years. She admitted the 
existence of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.h, and she provided correspondence 
indicating the current holder of the debt in 1.f. Applicant did not provide enough 
specifics about how circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her finances; 
she did not provide copies of her tax returns, which would have documented her 
changes in income; she did not show that she acted responsibly to address her 
delinquent debts; she did not show how she reduced her expenses to conform with 
changes of her income; she did not provide documentation showing a reasonable 
dispute of any SOR debts; she did not provide sufficient documented payment histories 
of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.h. Her failure to make greater progress resolving 
these three SOR debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment, and raises 
unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 18.    
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance 
to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent

with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her 
security clearance worthiness. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c through 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
