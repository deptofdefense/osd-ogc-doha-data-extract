FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 9, 
2015. On June 3, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 
2006. The AG are codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006), and they replace the 
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. 
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on June 16, 2016, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case 
on August 12, 2016. On August 15, 2016, a complete copy of the file of relevant 
 
 2
material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. The 
FORM included a copy of the SOR (Items 1 and 2), Applicant’s answer to the SOR 
(Item 3), a copy of Applicant’s SCA (Item 4), a summary of a personal subject interview 
(PSI) conducted on December 7, 2015 (Item 5), and a copy of a credit bureau report 
(CBR) dated November 18, 2015 (Item 6). He received the FORM on August 22, 2016; 
and did not object to any of the items in the FORM.1 On August 25, 2016, he submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A, containing explanations and matters in rebuttal, extenuation, 
and mitigation. AX A was admitted in evidence without objection. The case was 
assigned to me on November 8, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM, Applicant admitted all the 
allegations, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old integration mechanical engineer employed by a 
defense contractor since November 2015. He received a bachelor’s degree in March 
2003. He received a security clearance in June 2009. He voluntarily quit his job in April 
2015 to care for his father, who was recovering from a heart attack. He was 
unemployed until he began his current job. He lived on his savings while he was 
unemployed. (Item 5 at 5.). He has never married and has no children.  
 
 Applicant’s financial problems began when he and a friend purchased a home in 
2006. They had both been renting and they decided that buying and sharing a house 
was a better use of their income. The November 2015 CBR reflects a first mortgage 
loan of $300,000 and a second mortgage loan of $75,000. (Item 6 at 6, 9.) They made a 
verbal agreement to split the mortgage loan payments, maintenance costs, and 
improvements. The mortgage loan payments were $2,500 per month. The maintenance 
costs of the home were higher than they expected. Applicant was spending money to 
visit an out-of-state girlfriend, and his partner in the venture was unable to pay his share 
of the expenses. Applicant sought second-shift jobs, traded his car for a less expensive 
one, and minimized his living expenses. After an attempt at a short sale was 
unsuccessful, the mortgage was foreclosed in August 2010. (Item 5 at 1-2; Answer to 
SOR; Item 4 at 38; AX A at 8.) The November 2015 CBR does not reflect any deficiency 
from the foreclosure. At about the same time, Applicant fell behind on other financial 
obligations, giving rise to the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. 
                                                          
1 Item 5 is an unauthenticated summary of a personal subject interview. In the FORM, Applicant was 
notified that Item 5 was unauthenticated and might be inadmissible, and that his failure to object to it 
might result in waiver of any objection. Applicant provided a detailed response to the FORM but did not 
object to the admission of Item 5. I conclude that any objection to Item 5 was waived. “Although pro se 
applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to 
protect their rights under the Directive.” ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). 
 
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 The four delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in the November 2015 
CBR. (Item 6). The evidence regarding these delinquent debts is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: delinquent credit-card account, 180 days past due for about 
$1,386, with a total balance of $11,714. Applicant has remained in contact with this 
creditor but has not made any payments or negotiated a payment agreement for this 
debt. (AX A at 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c: delinquent credit-card account, placed for collection of 
about $4,074 in November 2015; and delinquent installment account, placed for 
collection of about $12,687 in November 2015. Applicant has remained in contact 
with the collection agency for these debts and has resolved other debts handled by the 
same collection agency. He was contacted by the collection agency in July 2016, who 
expressed willingness to negotiate payment plans for these two debts, but he has not 
yet responded to the offer or made any payments on these debts. (AX A at 4-6.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: delinquent credit-card account, placed for collection of about 
$11,100 in March 2010. This debt was paid in full in April 2011. (AX A at 6-7.) 
 
 In his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he 
has paid off about $68,000 in delinquent credit-card accounts and installment loans. 
(Answer at 3; AX A at 2.). If the $68,000 is added to the unpaid balances on the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, it means that Applicant accumulated more than $96,000 in credit card 
debt and installment loans.3  
 
Applicant drives a 13-year-old pickup and lives in a rental property. He works on 
weekends as an independent contractor for his family’s business. (AX A at 8-10.) His 
SCA reflects that he took two short vacations (five days or less) outside the United 
States in November 2013 and December 2014. (Item 4 at 29-30.) He has not provided 
any specific information regarding his net current income, expenses, and savings, if 
any. He has not explained how he accumulated $96,000 in credit card and installment 
debt. He has declared his intention to resolve the remaining three debts, but he has 
provided no timetable or plan for doing so. He has not sought or received financial 
counseling. (Item 5 at 9.)  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
                                                          
3 The defaulted mortgage loan and $68,000 in credit card and installment debt were not alleged in the 
SOR and may not be an independent basis for revoking Applicant’s security clearance. However, conduct 
not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a 
particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of 
a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) I have considered the 
unalleged debts for these limited purposes.

individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
 
 5
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his credit bureau reports, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The 
following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
 6
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous 
and recent. However, the defaulted mortgage was the result of circumstances making it 
unlikely to recur, because Applicant is not likely to rely on another verbal agreement to 
share the expenses of buying and maintaining a home. Applicant’s efforts to avoid 
foreclosure on the home contributed to his delinquent credit card and installment 
accounts, but cannot fully mitigate them. If Applicant paid $68,000 toward credit card 
and installment accounts that were not alleged in the SOR, it means that he 
accumulated more than $96,000 in credit card and installment debt that is unexplained 
and not likely to be completely attributable to the defaulted mortgage loans.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. The decline in the housing market, the failure of 
Applicant’s partner in the home purchase to pay his share of the expenses, and 
Applicant’s father’s heart attack in March 2015 were conditions largely beyond 
Applicant’s control. However, Applicant’s inability to resolve the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a-1.c was not largely due to these conditions. Instead, his inability to pay the debts 
alleged in the SOR was caused by his unexplained spending that resulted in $68,000 in 
delinquent debts that he chose to pay first. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial 
counseling and his financial problems are not yet under control. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, but not for the other 
debts alleged in the SOR. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance 
adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) 
The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to 
resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has not articulated a 
specific plan to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. A promise to pay a delinquent debt 
in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. 
ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008).  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts 
alleged in the SOR. 
 
 
 7
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I 
had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to 
question him about his explanations for his delinquent debts. See ISCR Case No. 01-
12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Applicant has satisfied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d and a number of debts not alleged in the SOR. However, his foolhardy decision to 
undertake responsibility for $375,000 in loans based on a verbal agreement and his 
unexplained accumulation of more than $96,000 in credit card and installment debt 
raise serious doubts about his reliability and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 14-
02394 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015.) 
 
“Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, 
there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 
F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). Applicant has not 
overcome that presumption.  
 
After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
