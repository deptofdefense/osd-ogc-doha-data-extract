MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant and his spouse became delinquent on their primary mortgage, on his 
home-equity loan, and one of Applicant’s credit cards, which was charged off for $10,637. 
They have reduced his past-due credit card balance to $1,635 and their mortgage has 
been rated as current since mid-2013. Applicant failed to make the payments on his 
seriously delinquent home-equity loan after it was restructured in late May 2015. As of 
February 2016, his loan was 120 days past due on a $49,245 balance. The financial 
considerations concerns are not fully mitigated. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On March 28, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance 
eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
 
2 
 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective 
within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
On April 17, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). 
On February 23, 2016, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. On February 25, 2016, I scheduled a hearing for March 23, 2016. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and 
seven Applicant exhibits (AEs A-G) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and his spouse witness testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on 
March 31, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant was past due $24,786 (SOR ¶ 
1.a) and $21,736 (SOR ¶ 1.c) on mortgage loans as of March 28, 2015. Additionally, an 
account had been charged off for $10,637 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and a $99 medical debt was in 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.d). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts, but 
indicated that he was making payments toward his home loans and the credit card debt. 
Applicant also stated that the medical debt was satisfied as of January 25, 2014. After 
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old software engineer, who earned his bachelor’s degree in 
2012. (Tr. 74.) He has been employed by the same defense contractor since March 2002 
and seeks his first DOD security clearance. Applicant and his current spouse married in 
March 2000. They have two children, now ages 15 and 13. Applicant’s wife has two sons, 
ages 25 and 23, from a previous marriage. Applicant had previously been married from 
June 1991 to September 1994, but he and his first wife had no children together. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant moved into his spouse’s home after their marriage. (Tr. 63.) In June 2003, 
he and his spouse obtained a $150,000 first mortgage, to be repaid at $1,834 per month 
for 15 years. In November 2004, they refinanced their mortgage through a loan of 
$233,000 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Their monthly payments decreased to $1,657. In June 2006, 
Applicant obtained a $40,000 home-equity loan, to be repaid at $399 per month (SOR ¶ 
1.a), to put an addition on their home. (Tr. 39.) Applicant and his spouse had a history of 
allowing both their mortgage loan and his home-equity loan to become past due 90 days. 
(GEs 2-4.)  
 
In January 2008, Applicant’s spouse started her own counseling practice. (AE C; Tr. 
49, 55.) She had about $15,000 saved for start-up costs for computer equipment, furniture, 
and office space rental. (Tr. 52-54.) For the first couple of years, she did some on-call work 
for her previous employer to supplement her income as a sole proprietor. (Tr. 54.) Even so, 
Applicant’s and his spouse’s annual household income declined from almost $100,000 to 
$60,000. (Tr. 33, 38.) Around May 2010, the younger of Applicant’s stepsons went to live 
3 
 
with his father for about a year. Applicant’s spouse’s ex-husband stopped paying child 
support, which had been around $1,000 per month. (Tr. 49, 55-56.) Applicant and his 
spouse had counted on the child support to meet their household expenses, including 
paying her student loans. (Tr. 42, 57-58.) Applicant’s stepson moved back into the 
household a year later at age 18, but he did not attend college full time, and Applicant’s 
spouse did not pursue her ex-husband for child support. (Tr. 56.) 
 
Applicant’s credit card account in SOR ¶ 1.b was charged off for $10,637 in 
November 2010. (GEs 3, 4.) Applicant claims that his account was current before it was 
cancelled automatically “by a computer decision” with a demand for the full balance, which 
he could not afford. (Tr. 35.) Available credit reports show the account as closed by the 
consumer with a last payment in June 2010. (GEs 3, 4.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse began falling seriously delinquent on their mortgage in the 
summer of 2011. (GE 4; AE G.) Around October 2011, Applicant’s father-in-law began 
having health problems that led to his death in January 2012. Applicant’s spouse lost 
income because she was unable to see clients when traveling and caring for her father. 
(AE C; Tr. 29-31, 59-60.) After her father died, Applicant’s spouse acquired a business 
partner. In the last three years, their business income has tripled. (Tr. 61-62.) 
 
On February 21, 2013, Applicant certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing. In response to an inquiry about whether he was currently 
receiving any assistance for financial difficulties, Applicant indicated that he and his spouse 
were working with their mortgage lender to get their loan “back on track with refinancing.” 
Applicant claimed that their mortgage lender had offered a refinancing option with terms 
not clearly described. Concerning any delinquencies involving enforcement in the last 
seven years, Applicant disclosed that court action had been taken against him for a credit 
card in default for $10,000 (SOR ¶ 1.b), but the creditor is limited under state law to 
collecting a maximum of $7,500. Applicant indicated that he paid $2,000 toward the debt to 
date with his monthly payments currently at $100. (GE 1.) Applicant and the creditor 
apparently agreed to the repayment term before a final judgment. (Tr. 44.) Applicant also 
disclosed on his SF 86 that he traveled to Europe for tourism for less than a week in the fall 
of 2012. (GE 1.) 
 
As of January 2013, Applicant and his spouse were $21,736 delinquent on their 
mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.c). Applicant’s home-equity loan was $19,989 past due on a balance of 
$36,198 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant’s $10,637 credit card delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.b) and a $99 
medical debt from February 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.d) were in collection status. (GE 4.) 
In December 2012, Applicant and his spouse were offered a trial repayment plan by 
their mortgage lender to suspend foreclosure of their joint home loan. Under the trial plan, 
they paid approximately $1,665 per month for three months. (AE B.) In March 2013, their 
loan was modified for $224,833 and extended for 17 years. (Tr. 64.) Applicant’s and his 
spouse’s mortgage loan was transferred in September 2013. As of January 2014, they 
were paying $939 plus escrow payments per month on a modified mortgage balance of 
$222,902. (GEs 2, 3; AEs C, G.) As of July 2015, their monthly mortgage payment was 
4 
 
almost $1,668. They were behind one payment. (AE B.) Applicant’s spouse testified that 
the company holding their mortgage did not receive payment within the 15-day grace 
period (Tr. 69), but she did not explain the reason. As of late November 2015, their loan 
was rated as current. (GE 2.) 
 
As of January 2014, Applicant had made no payments toward his home-equity loan 
delinquency, which had increased to $24,786 (SOR ¶ 1.a). (GE 3.) When he answered the 
SOR in April 2015, Applicant indicated that he began payments in January 2015 under a 
three-month trial period to renegotiate the loan. Loan modification documents show 
Applicant’s loan was modified in late May 2015 for a new loan of $50,605. The original 
maturity date of July 2021 stayed the same. Applicant was informed in the loan 
modification agreement that his monthly payment would increase and that the future 
monthly payments would be shown on his monthly statements. His new payment of $896 
per month was considered by Applicant and his spouse to be unaffordable. (GE 2, AE G; 
Tr. 34, 65.) Applicant’s spouse, who handles the family’s finances and dealt with the lender 
about the loan, suggests that Applicant had no choice but to agree to the loan modification 
or forfeit the opportunity to renegotiate the terms. (Tr. 65.) As of December 2015, the loan 
was reportedly $2,689 past due on a balance of $49,245. (GE 2.) 
 
 In January 2016, Applicant authorized a debt resolution company to negotiate for 
him toward restructuring his home-equity loan. Applicant arranged for the $3,600 in retainer 
fee to be paid on credit in two installments due in January 2016 and February 2016. (AEs 
C, D, F.) Applicant’s spouse negotiated a lower service fee of $3,000, which she paid. (Tr. 
70.) As of March 2016, the lender had authorized the debt resolution company to act on 
Applicant’s behalf. (AE B.) Applicant’s spouse testified to her understanding that Applicant 
will be offered a new three-month trial plan, and if those payments are made, his loan will 
be restructured for a monthly repayment less than the current scheduled payment of $896. 
(Tr. 71.) No payment has been made on the home-equity loan for several months. 
Applicant and his spouse were advised by the debt resolution company not to contact the 
lender or make any payments on the loan. (Tr. 72.) 
 
 As of July 28, 2015, Applicant owed $2,355 on the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. 
(AE A.) He continued to make payments to reduce the balance to $1,635 as of February 
23, 2016. (AE E.) About the $99 medical collection debt, Applicant has discrepantly 
indicated that the debt was satisfied as of January 2014 (Answer; AE C), but also that the 
agency was no longer collecting, as it had been “pulled back.” (Tr. 35. 43.) He recently 
learned it was for service at a hospital. (Tr. 43.) 
 
 Applicant’s spouse rehabilitated her student loans for her master’s degree. (Tr. 44, 
64.) Applicant and his spouse opened a car loan in September 2014 for $14,755, to be 
repaid at $353 per month. (GE 2; Tr. 44.) Available credit information shows that they were 
30 days behind in their car payments in February 2015, April 2015, June 2015, September 
2015, and January 2016. (GE 2; AE G.) 
  
 The older of Applicant’s spouse’s sons has lived on his own since graduating from 
college in 2013. Applicant’s spouse and her ex-husband split their son’s college costs. Her 
5 
 
younger son has lived with her for the past four or five years. Applicant and his spouse pay 
for his food but not his other expenses, such as his cell phone, his car, and his car 
insurance. (Tr. 61.) 
 
 By March 2016, Applicant’s spouse and her business partner had outgrown their 
office space and were looking to purchase a building for their practice. They now have 
seven employees. (Tr. 67.) According to Applicant’s spouse, her business is becoming the 
largest private counseling practice in her state. (Tr. 62.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
6 
 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet  
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 When Applicant applied for security clearance eligibility, his and his spouse’s joint 
mortgage was $21,736 past due (SOR ¶ 1.c). He was $19,989 past due on a $40,000 
home-equity loan obtained in June 2006 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He claims that he was current on his 
credit card in SOR ¶ 1.b before his account was closed automatically by computer action. 
Available credit records show that the account was closed by the consumer, and that his 
account was delinquent before it was charged off for $10,637 in November 2011. A $99 
medical debt from February 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.d) was placed for collection. Two disqualifying 
conditions, AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply. 
 
 Concerning mitigation of Applicant’s delinquent debts, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply. All of the debts in the SOR 
were seriously delinquent in 2013. Despite a creditable attempt at restructuring in May 
2015, Applicant’s home-equity loan was again in default as of his security clearance 
hearing in March 2016 with no repayment plan established to address the $49,245 
balance. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” is applicable to the extent that his and his spouse’s household 
finances were compromised by a loss of her income while she was caring for her ill father 
between October 2011 and January 2012. Her father’s illness and precipitous decline in his 
health were unexpected circumstances of the type contemplated within AG ¶ 20(b). 
Applicant has a less compelling case with respect to the income loss caused by his 
spouse’s decision to start her own counseling practice. While their household income 
declined considerably, from approximately $100,000 to $60,000, his spouse assumed the 
7 
 
risk that the demand for her services may be less than anticipated or that start-up 
expenses may exceed what she planned. The $1,000 in lost child support income was 
apparently unexpected. Yet, child support is not intended for household expenses that are 
incurred for expenses unrelated to caring for a child, such as his spouse’s student loan 
payments. 
 
 Applicant has not acted fully responsibly toward his creditors. Despite Applicant’s 
consistent employment with a defense contractor since 2002, the mortgage went unpaid 
for most if not all of 2012. Applicant (or his spouse on his behalf) made no payments on his 
home-equity loan for several years. Presumably, the income that should have gone toward 
the mortgage and home-equity loans went to establish his spouse’s business. They also 
had college costs for his stepson, who graduated from college in 2013. Applicant’s spouse 
split the education expenses with her ex-husband, but the record contains no detail about 
those costs. Applicant reported on his SF 86 that he took a short vacation to Europe in the 
fall of 2012. It is difficult to justify that expense when they were behind approximately 
$40,000 on their home loans. To suspend foreclosure action on their primary mortgage, 
Applicant and his spouse made payments required to modify their loan in 2013. However, 
despite the reported success of her counseling business in recent years, they were not so 
proactive in addressing Applicant’s home-equity loan. In response to the SOR, Applicant 
indicated that effective January 1, 2015, they began payments under a trial period to 
rehabilitate the loan. Applicant was successful in obtaining a modification of the loan in late 
May 2015, but the loan was again delinquent as of his hearing in March 2016. There is no 
evidence of any recent unforeseen circumstances that could reasonably explain or 
extenuate his failure to comply with the terms of the modified loan. Applicant’s spouse 
testified that the lender added the delinquency to the loan without extending the term, so 
the monthly payment almost tripled. Their loan has been delinquent since September 
2015. In the hope of a resolution more advantageous to them, they have not resumed 
repayment on the advice of a debt resolution firm retained at a cost of $3,000 to negotiate 
new terms with the lender. 
 
 Applicant’s and his spouse’s successful modification of their mortgage in 2013 
partially mitigates the financial considerations concerns. Some concern arises because 
they were late in paying their mortgage for July 2015, but their account has been rated as 
current since the modification. Also in his favor, Applicant has paid $100 a month for the 
past few years to reduce the credit card delinquency in SOR ¶ 1.b to $1,635 as of February 
2016. The mortgage and credit card delinquencies have been sufficiently resolved to apply 
AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” to those 
debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” is also implicated in that his consistent repayment of those two 
debts is evidence of good faith. Although Applicant and his spouse testified that they began 
addressing their delinquent debts starting with their mortgage, it cannot fairly be said that 
Applicant initiated repayment of the mortgage in SOR ¶ 1.c or the credit card debt in SOR 
¶ 1.b. He began repaying the credit card delinquency only after the creditor filed for a 
8 
 
judgment. As for the mortgage, their trial payments to modify the home loan were in 
response to a notice from the bank that their mortgage was seriously delinquent and that 
they had to respond by December 19, 2012, to suspend foreclosure action. 
 
  Concerning Applicant’s home-equity loan, the loan modification agreement 
Applicant signed in May 2015 does not include any specifics about the trial payments that 
Applicant (or his spouse for him) apparently paid before the lender would modify his loan. It 
is unclear whether Applicant contacted the creditor about a possible modification or 
whether, as with the mortgage, he acted in response to a notice of default. It is debatable 
whether Applicant’s lender could reasonably expect him to pay $896 per month on a loan 
restructured because of reported financial hardship. In early 2016, Applicant’s spouse paid 
a $3,000 service fee for a debt resolution company to negotiate a lower monthly payment 
for Applicant on the loan. It is unclear whether those fees were paid using a credit card or 
whether they had cash assets on hand that could have been used to make the $896 
payments during the fall of 2015 before Applicant formally retained the services of the debt 
resolution firm to negotiate on his behalf. The financial considerations concerns are not 
fully mitigated under AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d) without a repayment plan in place and a 
record of consistent compliance with the plan. About the $99 medical debt in collection, 
Applicant expressed his understanding as of April 16, 2015, that the debt was satisfied as 
of January 25, 2014. At his hearing, he testified conversely that collection was no longer 
being pursued. He testified that he only recently discovered that the debt was owed to a 
hospital, and he expressed an intention to contact the medical provider. The debt has 
apparently not been paid. His failure to take timely steps to address such a small debt does 
not inspire confidence in his ability or willingness to make regular payments toward his 
sizeable home-equity debt. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
1
 The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or 
even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR.
2
 However, there must be adequate 
                                                 
1 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
2 The DOHA Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, in part: 
9 
 
assurances that his financial problems are not likely to persist. Applicant has made 
insufficient progress toward resolving his home-equity loan that was modified for $50,605 
in late May 2015 and was 120 days past due as of February 2016. An intention to make 
payments provides insufficient guarantee, especially when it is unclear what he can afford 
and he has previously ignored the debt for years. The DOHA Appeal Board has 
consistently held that promises to pay debts do not substitute for a track record of timely 
payments and other financially responsible behavior.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-14565 
(App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015), citing ISCR Case No. 14-03069 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2015). It is 
also noted that Applicant’s recent credit reports (GE 2; AE G) show a history of late 
payments on an automobile loan opened in September 2014. The account has been 30 
days past due five times since February 2015, including in January 2016. Neither Applicant 
nor his spouse explained why they have been unable to make some of their debt payments 
on time, including their  mortgage payment for July 2015. Applicant’s spouse has 
rehabilitated her student loans, but there is no evidence of the amount of her student loan 
debt or monthly payments that apparently burden their household. 
 
 A determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance should not be 
made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation 
of the evidence to determine if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate 
security concern. For the reasons already noted, concerns persist about Applicant’s 
present financial stability to where I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant him security clearance eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
                                                                                                                                                             
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of 
“‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment of debts.” See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). 
However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate[s] that he has “. . . 
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his 
actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that 
the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the 
SOR.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
