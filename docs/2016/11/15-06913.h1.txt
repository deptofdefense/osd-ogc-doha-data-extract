MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
On April 6, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his familial 
and other personal connections and contacts in Turkey raised a security concern under 
the foreign influence guideline.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
to establish his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
 On September 13, 2016, I convened a hearing. After receipt of the transcript and 
the record closed, I provided written notice to the parties of my intent to resolve the case 
through a summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department Counsel indicated that 
the Government did not object to my proposed resolution of the matter in this fashion. 
See Appellate Exhibit I. 
 
 Applicant mitigated the heightened foreign influence security concerns raised by 
his foreign connections and contacts. Specifically, Applicant established that if a foreign 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

government or entity attempted to use his foreign connections and contacts to obtain 
classified information that, notwithstanding the obvious difficulty, he would repel any 
such attempt and resolve the conflict in favor of protecting U.S. information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I found that Applicant has, in a relatively short period of time, 
established deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, to 
include a family, home, and a well-paying job in the defense industry. The mitigating 
condition listed at AG ¶ 8(b) applies and, together with several whole-person factors, 
including a track record of proper handling and safeguarding sensitive information, 
mitigates the foreign influence security concern. 
 
In evaluating the security concern at issue, I weighed the evidence as a whole 
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice 
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept and considered the 
country at issue. After considering the entire record evidence, I conclude that Applicant 
met his heavy burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant’s request for 
a security clearance is granted.
