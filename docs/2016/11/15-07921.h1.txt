RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 15, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on May 12, 2016, and requested his case be 
decided based on the administrative record. On July 25, 2016, Applicant requested his 
case be converted and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On July 26 
2016, Department Counsel converted Applicant’s case. The case was assigned to me 
 
2 
 
 
on August 26, 2016. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing on September 16, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
October 19, 2016. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection.1 Applicant testified and offered Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A and B. The record was held open until November 2, 2016, to permit 
Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documents. On October 31, 2016, 
Applicant requested a continuance, which was granted until November 9, 2016, when 
the record closed. Applicant submitted AE C and D, which were admitted into evidence 
without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 27, 2016.  
 
Procedural Issues 
 
 Based on Applicant’s testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR 
by adding ¶ 1.o, which reads: You failed to timely file and pay your federal income tax 
returns for tax year 2015, as required.” There was no objection and the motion was 
granted.2  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful 
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 37 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997. He served in 
the military from 1997, until he was honorably discharged in 2008. Applicant married in 
2001 and has a 13-year-old child. Since being discharged from the military he had a 
three-month period of unemployment in 2009. He has worked for his current employer 
since January 2015.3 
 
 Applicant testified that it was a family decision for him to leave the military. He 
stated that when he was discharged, it was at the height of the recession, and he had a 
difficult time finding a job that matched his military salary. His wife has been steadily 
employed since Applicant’s discharge. Applicant and his wife both chose not to pay for 
the medical insurance that was offered by their employers because of its expense.4  
 
 In 2009, Applicant had an 8-day hospital stay. Since then he has had other 
medical issues that required treatment. Applicant testified that with his other expenses, 
he was living paycheck to paycheck. He was late paying his bills, and it was difficult to

get caught up. Since he started his current job, his pay has increased, and he has 
medical insurance. He stated he received a substantial pay raise last year.5  
 
Applicant completed a security clearance application in April 2015. In it he 
disclosed the following debts: a medical bill (SOR ¶ 1.d, $21,909) delinquent since 
October 2010; cell phone bill (SOR ¶ 1.e, $1,764) delinquent since August 2013; fitness 
club bill (SOR ¶ 1.m, $534) delinquent since April 2014. He indicated he was working on 
monthly payment plans with the creditors.6  
 
Applicant did not take any action on any of his delinquent debts until after he 
received the SOR in April 2016. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($1,024) is a charged off 
account for furniture that Applicant financed sometime before 2008. He stopped making 
payments on it in 2010. He made a couple of small payments after May 2016 and was 
then offered a settlement. In September 2016, he settled and paid the debt for $256. He 
provided documentary evidence.7 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($989) is a charged off credit card debt. Applicant has no 
idea when he stopped paying this debt. In May 2016, he made a payment plan to pay 
$15 bi-monthly. He has made consistent payments on this plan since then.8 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($596) is a charged off credit card debt. Applicant does 
not know when it became delinquent, but believes it was around 2010. In May 2016, he 
made one payment of $15. No other payments have been made.9  
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($21,506) is a collection account for medical services that 
has been owed by Applicant since 2009. Applicant made one payment of $15 in May 
2016. No other payments have been made. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($403) is a collection 
account for medical services to the same creditor, also owed since 2009. Applicant 
made a $10 payment on this debt in May 2016. No other payments have been made.10 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,764) is a collection account for a cell phone debt. The 
debt became delinquent around 2011. In May 2016, Applicant made two payments of 
$20 and $30. He then made $30 payments in June, July, and August 2016. No other 
information was provided as to the current status of this debt.11

 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,082) is a collection account for a medical debt for an 
emergency room visit in 2010. Applicant has been making bi-monthly payments of $15 
since May 2016.12 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($824) is a collection account for a telecommunication bill 
that has been owed for about two years. In May 2016, Applicant made a $15 payment. 
No proof of additional payments was provided.13 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($686) is a collection account for an internet provider bill. 
Applicant testified he defaulted on the debt about three years ago. He stated he made a 
payment of $25. The letter he provided confirmed that Applicant contacted the creditor 
and the current balance owed was $669. No proof of additional payments was 
provided.14 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($582) is a collection account for a medical debt incurred in 
July 2014. Applicant made a $15 payment in May 2016. No other proof of payments 
was provided.15 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($538) is a collection account for satellite television service 
that has been owed since about 2014. Applicant made a $20 payment on the account in 
May 2016. No other proof of payments was provided.16 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($378) is a collection account for an electric bill owed since 
2010. Applicant contacted the creditor in May 2016 and promised to begin making 
monthly payments of $40. He did not make any payments.17 
 
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($534) is a collection account for a fitness club 
membership. Applicant indicated he defaulted on the debt in about 2014. When asked 
why he signed a contract for a gym membership when he had so many delinquent 
debts, he stated: “my thinking was it was $10 a month and it wasn’t a big deal for me.”18 
He contacted the creditor in May 2016 and has made eight payments of $15 since 
then.19

 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($184) is a collection account for medical services that 
became delinquent sometime in 2013. Applicant made 13 payments since May 2016 for 
a total of $120 towards resolving the debt. Applicant was asked why, in 2013 when this 
debt was incurred, he could not afford to pay this bill when both he and his wife were 
employed. Applicant stated: “I don’t have an answer. I don’t.”20 
 
 Applicant testified that he did not timely file or pay his 2015 Federal income taxes 
as required. He filed about a month late because he did not have the money to pay for a 
tax professional to prepare his tax return. He estimated he owes about $1,200 to the 
IRS. He indicated he received a bill from the IRS, but has not arranged an installment 
payment plan. Applicant was given an opportunity to provide documents to show his 
2015 federal income tax return was filed. He did not provide any documents.21  
 
 Applicant estimated that his wife’s annual salary is about $45,000 and has been 
for a couple of years. In 2013, Applicant was earning about $30,000. It is unknown what 
his current annual income is, but he testified that since January 2016 he has doubled 
his income from his previous job. He does not have a written budget. He has no 
savings. He has a 401k retirement account. He testified that he does not know where he 
and his wife spend their money. He is hoping to pay off his smaller debts and then the 
larger ones.22  
 
 Applicant’s admissions and credit reports dated May 2015 and June 2016 
substantiate the debts alleged in the SOR.23 In addition, Applicant provided a 
consolidated credit report from September 2016, which includes all three of the credit 
bureaus. Applicant testified he has a cable service account. All three credit bureaus 
report an additional collection account with this same provider and there is a past due 
balance of $682.24  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

24 AE B. I have not considered this debt for disqualifying purposes, but I may consider it when analyzing 
Applicant’s credibility, in mitigation, and the whole person.  
 
6 
 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
7 
 
 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified 
information.25 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following two are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
 (g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that began in 2009. He failed to 
timely file his 2015 Federal income tax return and pay his 2015 federal income taxes. 
The above disqualifying conditions apply.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
                                                          
25 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
8 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant voluntarily left military service in 2008. He attributed his financial 
difficulties to being underemployed after his discharge and not having medical 
insurance. In his April 2015 SCA, Applicant indicated that he was making monthly 
payment arrangements with several creditors for delinquent accounts. He did not take 
any action to resolve his delinquent debts until after he received the SOR in April 2016. 
He made minimal payments on his delinquent debts. His numerous delinquent debts 
remain unresolved. He failed to pay his 2015 federal income taxes. He does not know 
where he spends his money. I cannot find that his financial problems are unlikely to 
recur. His behavior cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG 
¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 For the application of AG ¶ 20(b), there must be conditions that were beyond 
Applicant’s control that resulted in the financial hardship, and he must have acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant attributed his financial problems to 
being underemployed and not having medical insurance. It has been eight years since 
his discharge. Applicant and his wife have had a combined salary of about $75,000 
since at least 2013. Applicant indicated that since he started his current job and 
received a raise, he has doubled his salary from then. There is no evidence that 
Applicant attempted to pay any of his delinquent debts until after receiving the SOR. 
Since May 2016, he has made consistent payments on some debts, others he has only 
made one small payment, and at least for one debt he promised to make $40 payments 
and did not make any. He also failed to pay his 2015 federal income taxes and his most 
recent credit report shows a new collection account. Applicant failed to show he acted 
responsibly. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies.  
 
 There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling. After receiving the 
SOR, he made small payments toward his delinquent debts, but he incurred new 
delinquent debts. He has not followed through on promises to pay. He does not have a 
budget or a grasp for where he spends his money. Despite making some payments, 
there are not clear indications that his financial problems are under control. Applicant’s 
minimal payment on each of his delinquent debts, made after he received the SOR, 
does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. 
Applicant settled and paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to this debt, but not 
to any of the other SOR debts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
9 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 37 years old. He attributed his financial problems to being 
underemployed and not having medical insurance. However, he has been steadily 
employed since 2009, as has his wife. He testified that since starting to work for his 
current employer, his salary has increased. He made no effort to repay his creditors, 
some that have been owed for more than six years, until after he received the SOR. He 
failed to pay his 2015 federal income taxes. He does not know where he and his wife 
spend their money. Although Applicant has recently made consistent payments on 
some of his delinquent debts, he does not have a reliable track record for me to 
conclude that he will continue making the payments. He has not followed through on 
paying other creditors as promised or he discontinued making payments on some 
debts. Applicant does not have a realistic grasp on his current finances. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to 
mitigate the financial considerations guideline security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.o:   Against Applicant 
  
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
