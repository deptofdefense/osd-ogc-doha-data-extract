Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not make sufficient progress addressing her delinquent tax debts. 
She has owed delinquent federal income taxes since 2005. Financial considerations 
trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 11, 2014, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 28, 
2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective 
on September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue 
Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
information. (HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On May 17, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 3) On July 
11, 2016, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On August 1, 2016, 
the case was assigned to me. On September 1, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for September 26, 2016. (HE 1) 
The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government provided nine 
exhibits; Applicant offered five exhibits; and all exhibits were admitted into evidence 
without objection. (Tr. 20-22, 49-50; Government Exhibits 1-9; Applicant Exhibits (AE) 
A-E) On October 4, 2016, I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.). On October 24, 
2016, Applicant submitted 19 documents, which were admitted into evidence without 
objection. (AE F-X) On October 26, 2016, the record closed. (Tr. 54, 77, 85-86)   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.c. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) Her 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old senior software test engineer, who has been working 
for her employer for five years. (Tr. 6, 23) In 1993, she graduated from high school. (Tr. 
7) She has 68 college credits, and she expects to receive a science degree in May 
2017. (Tr. 7) She has worked on a DOD project since 2003. (Tr. 8) She has not served 
in the U.S. military. (GE 1) In July 2005, she married, and she has two children, who are 
ages 10 and 20 years old. (Tr. 19, 73; GE 1) Her 20-year-old son has excellent potential 
in university-level athletics and academically. (AE H; AE I) In September 2016, she filed 
for divorce. (Tr. 47, 73; AE L) There is no evidence that Applicant committed criminal 
offenses, abused alcohol or drugs, or violated her employment rules. (GE 1)  
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s SOR response, SCA, credit reports, Office of Personnel Management 
personal subject interview (OPM PSI), bankruptcy filings, and hearing record establish 
the SOR allegations.  
 
In 2003 or 2004, Applicant purchased a residence for about $212,000. (Tr. 25, 
27; SOR response) Her monthly mortgage payment was about $1,300, and in 2006, her 
renters stopped making their rent payments. (Tr. 25, 27) In turn, Applicant defaulted on 
her mortgage payments. (Tr. 27-28) The mortgage company said she should stop 
making payments, and they were going to adjust the mortgage or make a mortgage 
modification. (Tr. 28) Applicant requested a mortgage modification; however, it was 
never approved. (Tr. 28)  
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

In August 2007, Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured delinquent debts totaling 
$41,030 were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Her 2007 
bankruptcy listed total liabilities of $348,192, including $9,000 in delinquent federal 
taxes from 2005 or 2006. (Tr. 24; SOR response ¶ 1.a; GE 1; GE 2; GE 7) The 
defaulted mortgage was listed in her 2007 bankruptcy. (Tr. 29) She believed her 
mortgage debts were discharged by her 2007 bankruptcy. (Tr. 30) 
 
In November 2013, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of 
the Bankruptcy Code. Her liabilities totaled $169,634, including $64,000 owed to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2005 to 2010, and student loans totaling 
$41,933. (SOR response ¶ 1.b; GE 8) Her nonpriority unsecured debts totaled $89,756. 
(GE 8) According to the bankruptcy trustee’s status report, her first payment was due in 
December 2013; her monthly payment was $300; she paid $3,450; and she was $450 
behind when her bankruptcy trustee’s status report was issued. (GE 8) In April 2015, 
the bankruptcy court dismissed her bankruptcy. (SOR response ¶ 1.b; GE 1; GE 2; GE 
8) 
 
In June 2015, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. Her liabilities totaled $164,035, and included $64,279 owed to the IRS for tax 
years 2005 to 2010 and $41,933 of guaranteed student loan debt. (GE 9) The 
bankruptcy court discharged her nonpriority unsecured debts on September 14, 2015. 
(SOR response ¶ 1.c; GE 1; GE 2; GE 9) 
 
For tax years 2005 through 2010, Applicant did not have enough money withheld 
from her paycheck for her taxes. (Tr. 30-32) In 2006, the IRS contacted Applicant and 
informed her that she owed about $15,000 for her 2005 taxes. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant 
contacted a company to assist her with her taxes; however, the company was a 
fraudulent company. (Tr. 33) She made some payments, and the company said they 
were working with the IRS. (Tr. 34) She contacted the IRS and learned the company 
was not working with the IRS to resolve her tax debt. (Tr. 34) In 2007, she may have 
made $50 monthly payments to the IRS for about 6 to 12 months. (Tr. 34) After 2007, 
she made $50 to $100 monthly payments to the IRS. (Tr. 38) 
 
Around 2012 or 2013, Applicant and her spouse separated because of his 
alcoholism, abuse, and erratic employment history. (Tr. 45-46; AE G; SOR response) 
He refused to provide financial support to Applicant. (Tr. 47; AE G) In 2013, Applicant 
had medical expenses from her father, who had treatments for cancer for 12 months, 
and her son, who had a football injury. (Tr. 39; SOR response) Her father passed away, 
and there were funeral expenses after her father’s death. (Tr. 39) She decided to file for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13 because she wanted to reorganize and pay her debts. (Tr. 
43) Starting in December 2013, she had a requirement under Chapter 13 to make 
monthly $300 payments. (Tr. 39) From December 2013 to May 2015, the bankruptcy 
trustee made monthly payments to the IRS of $100 to $300. (Tr. 39; GE 8 at 52) In April 
2015, her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed. (Tr. 39) Applicant said her bankruptcy 
was dismissed because she believed she could make greater progress on her taxes 
without utilizing the Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment plan. (Tr. 41-42) The cited legal 
basis for dismissal of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was Applicant’s failure to provide the 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
$490 refund of her taxes to the trustee, and the IRS filed claim of $64,279 made 
completion of the plan impossible. (AE W; AE X) The IRS had intercepted the $490 
refund. 
   
Once Applicant became eligible for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, she filed for it. (Tr. 
44) On May 9, 2015, she completed financial processing and a budget as part of the 
bankruptcy process. (SOR response, GE 9) She was able to obtain discharge of 
$164,000 in nonpriority unsecured debt. (Tr. 44) Her student loans and tax debts 
survived the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 44-45)    
 
Applicant is working with a money management company (MMC) to help her 
organize her finances and arrange payments to her creditors. (Tr. 62) The MMC budget 
she generated showed a $558 monthly deficit and a proposed budget with a $308 
monthly deficit. (SOR response, MMC Plan at 5 of 8) She acknowledged that she used 
credit excessively and did not use a budget as part of the cause of her financial 
problems. (Tr. 63) In April 2016, she purchased a 2013 vehicle for $33,000, and her 
monthly payments are $667. (Tr. 64-65) Her September 25, 2016 credit report shows 
her vehicle loan is in paid as agreed status. (Tr. 71; AE D at 3) Applicant’s April 2016 
budget shows she has a monthly surplus of about $350. (Tr. 67-69)

Applicant only provided the first page of her tax transcripts. (AE M-AE V) Without 
complete copies of the tax transcripts, it is not possible to determine how or when the 
delinquent taxes for several years were resolved. The “Refund or Owed” column does 
not include interest and penalties charged by the IRS. Some of the tax transcripts 
showed late filing of Applicant’s tax returns and IRS-imposed financial penalties for late 
filings. (AE M-AE V) For example, her 2007 tax return was filed October 6, 2008, and 
her late filing penalty was $1,308. (AE N) Her 2008 tax return was filed on October 5, 
2009, and her late filing penalty was $1,385. (AE O) Her 2009 tax return was filed on 
May 2, 2011, and her late filing penalty was $1,484. (AE P) Applicant incorrectly stated

at her hearing that she filed her income taxes on time every year (by April 15 of the next 
year). (Tr. 75) Applicant had some delinquent state taxes; however, the last $200 she 
owes will be paid in October 2016. (Tr. 76-77; SOR response) The SOR does not allege 
Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns, or that she failed to timely 
pay her federal income taxes after 2010.2  
 
Applicant did not significantly address her tax problems for several years 
because she was focused on taking care of her family and the issues involving her 
husband. (Tr. 56) Applicant’s September 25, 2016 credit report indicates she had a 
$42,000 federal tax lien filed in 2012. (AE 6; AE B at 4) She said as of September 16, 
2016, her current tax debt is $23,984; however, she did not provide any IRS 
documentation showing this total for her tax debt. (Tr. 48, 52; AE E) After her debts 
were discharged through bankruptcy, she said she made $100 monthly payments to the 
IRS. (Tr. 51) About three months before Applicant’s hearing, she consulted a certified 
public accountant. (Tr. 38) Applicant said the IRS asked her to pay $500 monthly to 
address her tax debt. (Tr. 38) Around March 2016, she instructed her employer to start 
taking $500 monthly out of her pay to address her tax debt. (Tr. 50; AE E)  
 
Applicant is currently attending college, and her student loans are deferred. (Tr. 
57-58) She plans to pay her student loans when her loan deferment ends. (Tr. 61) 
Applicant’s son is in college, and she is making payments on his student loans. (Tr. 59) 
She is helping him with his other college expenses. (Tr. 60)   
 
Character Evidence 
 
 A division manager, a program manager, senior principal, and an assistant 
executive director provided character statements on Applicant’s behalf. (SOR response) 
The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is diligent, positive, motivated, 
capable, dependable, reliable, and professional. (SOR response) She showed 
leadership, was a team player, and made solid contributions to mission 
accomplishment. (SOR response) 
                                            
2Applicant’s SOR does not allege that she did not timely file her federal tax returns for several 
years or that she failed to pay her required taxes in full for tax years 2014 and 2015. In ISCR Case No. 
03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not 
alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

Consideration of her failure to timely file her federal income tax returns or that she failed to pay her 
required taxes in full for tax years 2014 and 2015 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed 
above.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7, C3.1.2.2, and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the 
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of national security and sensitive records is paramount. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s SOR response, 
SCA, credit reports, bankruptcy filings, and hearing record establish the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important positive financial information. Circumstances beyond her control adversely 
affected her finances: Applicant had medical bills from her father’s illness and funeral 
expenses; she had medical bills from her son’s injury; and she had expenses from her 
separation and divorce. She disclosed her financial problems on her SCA and during 
her OPM PSI. She filed all required state and federal tax returns, although some returns 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

were not timely. See note 2 supra. She made some payments to address her delinquent 
tax debt over the years. She paid $3,450 into her Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, and her 
efforts in regard to her Chapter 13 bankruptcy are a mitigating circumstance.  
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The SOR 
alleges, and the record establishes that Applicant has owed federal income taxes since 
2005, and most recently she underpaid her taxes in 2014 and 2015 by about $20,000. 
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s [trust]worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior 
behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 
(App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s 
course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate to 
support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax 
returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
The negative financial and judgment information in Applicant’s case is significant. 
The record established that Applicant has owed taxes to the IRS since 2005. Her 
nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code 
in 2007 and 2015. It is unclear how much she currently owes the IRS. Although she said 
she recently started making $500 monthly payments to the IRS, there is an insufficient 
track record of making significant payments to the IRS. Her explanations do not fully 
mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.

Applicant is a 41-year-old senior software test engineer, who has been working 
for her employer for five years. She has 68 college credits, and she expects to receive a 
science degree in May 2017. She has worked on a DOD project since 2003. In July 
2005, she married, and in September 2016, she filed for divorce. There is no evidence 
of Applicant’s criminal offenses, alcohol or drug abuse, or violations of her employment 
rules. Several circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her finances, 
including illness and death of her father, injury of her son, and her separation and 
divorce. The general sense of Applicant’s character statements is that Applicant is 
diligent, positive, motivated, capable, dependable, reliable, and professional. She 
showed leadership, was a team player, and made solid contributions to mission 
accomplishment.  
 
The negative financial information is more significant. Applicant’s nonpriority 
unsecured debts were discharged in 2007 and September 2015. She has had a 
delinquent tax debt owed to the IRS since 2005. In 2014 and 2015, she generated 
$20,000 in additional delinquent federal income tax debt. When a tax issue is involved, 
an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their 
tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits 
after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.4 The primary problem 
here is that Applicant has owed the IRS for delinquent taxes since 2005, and her tax 
problems are getting worse.     
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of 
                                            
4The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security and trustworthiness concerns arising from 
tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of 
security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then 
taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant 
has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected 
of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 
2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

access to sensitive information. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of access to sensitive 
information to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform 
necessary for award of a public trust position in the future. With a track record of 
behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her worthiness for a public trust position.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, the Directive, the 
Regulation, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a 
public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
