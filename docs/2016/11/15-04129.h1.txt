GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 22, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On December 4, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to her, under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made 
under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD

adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 17, 2015. On December 18, 2015, she 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on February 24, 
2016. The case was assigned to me on March 23, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on April 28, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 17, 2016. 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3, 19 Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE S, and one administrative exhibit, were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 26, 2016. 
I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. She took advantage of that 
opportunity and timely submitted additional documents, which were marked and admitted 
as AE T through AE AC, without objection. The record closed on June 7, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five (¶¶ 1.c. through 1.g.)  of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations. Applicant’s admissions and 
comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a 
master resilience trainer and performance expert with the company since July 2015.2 She 
was actually hired by a different contractor on the same contract (with an annual salary 
of $72,000) in September 2014, but because of her security clearance processing, she 
was switched over to her current employer, and her annual income was reduced to 
$60,008. She previously held a variety of positions with other commercial entities as a 
performance specialist, lead health coach, part-time bartender, program director, part-
time server, and secondary market shipping coordinator. She was self-employed as a 
short sale negotiator – loss mitigation specialist, and loan processor.3 A 1998 high school 
graduate, Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management in 2002 and 
a master’s degree in sports psychology in 2014.4 She has never served with the U.S. 
military.5 She has never held a security clearance.6 Applicant has never been married.7

Financial Considerations8 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the national economy 
plummeted and the banking and real estate sectors were essentially severely wounded 
in 2007-2009. Applicant was initially a self-employed loan processor, but then shifted to 
a short sale negotiator - loss mitigation specialist for a company. Because of the economic 
environment, she was experiencing an extremely high level of stress, working longer 
hours for reduced and inconsistent salary. In December 2009, she opted to make a 
lifestyle and career change.9 Subsequently, due to illness, Applicant had to leave at least 
one job voluntarily to be closer to her doctor, and on two other occasions she had to take 
lengthy periods of medical leave, resulting in the loss of two jobs.10 She was unemployed 
from November 2012 until February 2013, and from June 2014 until September 2014.11 
Her fragile health, frequent relocations, repeated job loses, and periods of unemployment 
left her without the financial resources to maintain her accounts in a current status. 
Applicant’s adjusted gross income was, for several years, essentially very low: $1,643 
(2010), $5,984 (2001), $3,714 (2012), $19,650 (2013), and $17,799 (2014).12 Accounts 
became delinquent. Some accounts were charged off, tax liens were filed, and a vehicle 
was repossessed. 
In an effort to reduce expenses, Applicant moved back to live with her family while 
attempting to regain some fiscal and health stability. She considered bankruptcy and, 
although she obtained bankruptcy pre-filing guidance in April 2013,13 she chose not to 
follow that path of resolution. Instead, when she obtained better employment, she 
eventually reached out to her creditors and established repayment arrangements. She 
read a financial guidance book by Dave Ramsey and prioritized her accounts. In June 
2014, for a $1,500 fee, she engaged the professional services of a tax specialist to assist 
her in resolving various state and federal income tax issues.14 In January 2015 – one year 
before the SOR was issued – she also sought the professional services of an attorney to 
rehabilitate her credit.15 Her adjusted gross income for 2015 increased to $56,632.16

Some accounts have been resolved, others are in the process of being resolved, and still 
others are scheduled to be attended to as soon as others are satisfied. 
The SOR identified nine purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, filed as a tax lien, or resulted in a repossession, as reflected by 
the September 2014 credit report17 or the November 2015 credit report.18 Those debts, 
totaling approximately $55,298, and their respective current status, according to the credit 
reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s 
comments regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a state tax lien in the amount of $1,094, which arose from 
Applicant’s inability to fully pay her 2009 income tax. When she learned of the lien, she 
set up a repayment arrangement, and the lien was paid off and released in November 
2015, months before the SOR was issued.19 Department Counsel conceded that the lien 
has been released.20 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a state tax lien in the amount of $4,492, which arose when 
the state erroneously presumed that Applicant was still a resident of the state in 2012. 
When she learned of the lien, she challenged it, and after furnishing information to the 
satisfaction of the state, the tax lien was released as having been recorded in error.21 
Department Counsel conceded that the lien has been released.22 The account has been 
resolved. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a bank credit card account with a $2,500 credit limit and a 
high credit of $3,216 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. The new 
creditor increased the unpaid balance to $3,391.23 In June 2014, the new creditor offered 
to settle the account for $2,712.78.24 While no payments have been made at this time, 
Applicant expected to move the account higher on her priority list, and she intends to try 
to settle the account in mid-2016.25 The account has not  been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is an automobile loan account opened in 2008 with a high credit 
of $17,000 and past due and remaining balance of $9,446 that was placed for collection 
in 2010.26 Applicant contacted the lender several times to explain her financial difficulties, 
but no arrangements could be worked out, so she voluntarily relinquished the vehicle. 
The lender never furnished Applicant any documentation regarding the result of the 
voluntary repossession, and she has no knowledge if the vehicle was sold at auction or if 
there is actually a pending balance. Applicant has not followed up on the status of the 
account since she relinquished the vehicle. However, if there is a remaining balance, she 
intends to pay it off as the account is number three on her priority list. 27 The account has 
not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a bank credit card account, primarily used for business, with 
a credit limit of $11,000 and an unpaid balance of $12,980 that was charged off.28 
Applicant attempted to modify her payment arrangements but was unable to do so, and 
her efforts and payments ceased in about July 2010. She intends to pay the account off 
as it is number four on her priority list.29 The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $15,000 and 
an unpaid balance of $14,761 that was charged off.30 Applicant attempted to modify her 
payment arrangements but was unable to do so, and her efforts and payments ceased in 
about July 2010. She intends to pay the account off as it is number five on her priority 
list.31 The account has not been resolved. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is an unspecified type of account with a remaining and past- 
due balance of $8,982 that was sold to a debt purchaser.32 The original creditor has not 
been identified. Although Applicant has made no effort to contact the original creditor of 
the debt purchaser, she intends to pay the account off as it is number two on her priority 
list.33 The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.i.): These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of 
$259 and $67 that were placed for collection.34 Although Applicant initially said that the 
accounts had been paid,35 she changed her explanation to state that the accounts had

been disputed and removed from her credit report as having been listed in error.36 A report 
from her attorney in mid-2015 confirms the removal.37 Neither account is listed in her 
November 2015 credit report. While Applicant count not furnish any other documentation 
to confirm her contentions, it nevertheless appears that the accounts have been resolved. 
In addition to the SOR-related accounts, Applicant had a number of accounts, both 
delinquent and current, to which she directed her attention. Her first priority is her car, for 
which she makes monthly payments of $341; and next are student loans with payments 
of $186 and $321. She also paid off a number of accounts and debts including her IRS 
tax lien ($6,134) in May 2015;38 a medical bill ($1,645.54) in March 2015;39 a cellular 
phone bill ($440) in May 2016;40 and a family loan ($1,550) in May 2016.41 
In June 2016, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement that included 
her budget over a multi-year period and her Snowball of prioritized accounts. She listed 
her net monthly income as $3,352; monthly expenses of $3,174; and a monthly remainder 
of $178 available for discretionary saving or spending.42 She noted that she had an 
emergency fund of $1,034, a savings accumulation of $2,847 for debt payoffs, and $1,304 
in a checking account. She estimated that after her impending settlement of the account 
referred to in SOR ¶ 1.c., her savings account would be reduced to $134.43 Applicant has 
made substantial process in resolving her delinquent accounts, including at least some 
that were not alleged in the SOR. It appears that Applicant’s financial status has improved 
significantly, and that her financial problems are finally under control.  
Character References 
 A deputy sheriff who has known and worked with Applicant since she was a faculty 
member and coach and Applicant was a high school student and team member in 1995, 
noted that Applicant is active in the community in a partnership with the local high school 
and local youth sports. She characterized Applicant as a person of commitment and 
character, a teammate, and a leader. Applicant is trustworthy.44 The head coach of one

of the teams with which Applicant is involved indicated that Applicant has been one of his 
coaching assistants for a number of months and he has found her very helpful, honest, 
and willing to go above and beyond.45 A Ph.D. contractor with whom Applicant trained for 
their current assignments about two years ago, characterized her as having maturity, self-
awareness, honesty, and authenticity. Although she now runs her own consulting 
business, she still relies on Applicant’s wise counsel, and considers her to be reliable and 
trustworthy.46 Applicant’s manager issued the initial performance review for Applicant 
covering her first five months, and he rated her as having met or exceeded expectations.47  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”48 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”49   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”50 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

50 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.51  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”52 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”53 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
                                                          
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
51 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2007-2009, and 
increased during the ensuing years. Accounts became delinquent. Some were charged 
off, tax liens were filed, and a vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in 
the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, 
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), 
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person 
has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG 
¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”54 In addition, 
AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by her personal frivolous or irresponsible spending. Also, it does not 
appear that she spent beyond her means. Instead, her financial problems initially 
occurred when the national economy and the associated banking and real estate markets 
collapsed, events that were largely beyond her control. Her income from her businesses 
as a self-employed loan processor, and later a short sale negotiator – loss mitigation 
specialist for a company, diminished as her stress level increased. Health issues, frequent 
                                                          
54 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

relocations, repeated job losses, and periods of unemployment created additional 
financial burdens. She reduced her expenses and considered, but rejected, bankruptcy. 
Instead. She stabilized her health and financial situations. She obtained better 
employment, reached out to creditors, obtained financial and legal guidance, prioritized 
her debts, established repayment arrangements where possible, and started efforts to 
repair her credit.  
 
Well before the SOR was issued, Applicant commenced her arduous task of 
resolving her debts, limited largely by an inability to generate the funds to do so more 
expeditiously. By the time the SOR was issued, she had already resolved a number of 
them. Following her established repayment plan, or her Snowball as she refers to it, she 
paid off a $6,134 federal tax lien and some other debts. Her plan continued unabated 
even after the SOR was issue. One $1,094 state tax lien was paid off, and another $4,492 
state tax lien was dismissed when it was found to have been filed in error. Miscellaneous 
minor debts have been paid off or otherwise resolved. Some accounts were effectively 
and successfully disputed. With a current annual salary of $60,008, it appears that 
Applicant’s financial status has improved significantly, and that her financial problems are 
finally under control. She appears to have acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s 
actions, under the circumstances confronting her, no longer cast doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.55 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.56

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
maintain her normal monthly payments to a number of her accounts, and, over a several-
year period, a number of them became delinquent and were placed for collection. Some 
accounts were charged-off, tax liens were filed, and a vehicle was repossessed.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant was a self-employed loan 
processor, and then a short sale negotiator – loss mitigation specialist for a company 
when the national economy plummeted and the banking and real estate sectors were 
negatively impacted. Her subsequent health issues, the loss of two jobs, periods of 
unemployment, and frequent relocations left her without the financial resources to 
maintain her accounts in a current status. However, rather than escaping her financial 
burdens by filing for bankruptcy, she chose not to ignore her delinquent debts. Instead, 
as she was becoming more financially able, she entered into repayment agreements with 
some of her creditors. She paid off or otherwise resolved some SOR-related debts as well 
as some debts that were not alleged in the SOR.  
Applicant now has an annual salary of $60,008, whereas during 2010 her adjusted 
gross income was $1,643. She has now accounted for all of her delinquent debts, and 
they are all in her Snowball plan for resolution. Considering her current salary, and the 
probability for an increase, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems 
essentially are under control. Based on the characterizations of her character references, 
Applicant’s reputation for honesty, integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness, appear to 
support her continuing debt repayment plans consistent with her Snowball list of 
priorities.57  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
                                                          
57 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 58 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, limited only by her modest earnings, and she started to do so well 
before the SOR was issued. She keeps track of her expenses and maintains a budget. 
She is continuing to follow her debt repayment plans consistent with her Snowball list of 
priorities. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
security worthiness. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG 
¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
