KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: Applicant points to evidence that he has resolved most of the SOR debts, including a
tax lien.  He argues that he “has taken substantial steps to resolve” his remaining tax debts. 
Applicant’s argument is not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge failed to consider all
of the evidence in the record or to show that he mis-weighed the evidence. Applicant has cited to
Hearing Office cases that, he contends, support his effort to obtain a clearance.  We give these
cases due consideration.  However, Hearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing Office
Judges or on the Appeal Board.  Adverse decision affirmed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
December 22, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for
that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On August 31, 2016, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
The Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issue raised on appeal:  Applicant
has been employed by a Defense contractor since 2014.  He experienced periods of unemployment
between 2008 and 2014.  Applicant’s SOR includes two tax liens.1  One was filed in May 2011 in
the amount over $62,000 covering tax years 2001 through 2006.  The other was filed in October
2011 for nearly $19,000 covering tax years 2008 through 2010.  Applicant provided financial
support to family members rather than pay taxes.  He has been making payments on his tax debts
since 2011.  He has submitted offers in compromise to the IRS and believes that, if they are
accepted, he can resolve his tax liabilities in a year or more.  He has timely filed his returns since
2010.  Applicant has resolved, or successfully disputed, other debts alleged in the SOR, for such
things as medical expenses, telecommunications services, child support, etc.
The Judge’s Analysis
The Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR allegations except the two tax liens described above. 
Though noting that Applicant had presented some mitigating information, the Judge cited to
evidence that Applicant has owed taxes to the Federal Government for many years.  He stated that
Applicant’s history of failing to pay taxes when due raises unresolved security concerns.  Evidence
that Applicant had provided some financial support to family members was not enough fully to
mitigate the security concerns arising from his tax delinquencies.
Discussion
Applicant points to evidence that he has resolved most of the SOR debts, including a tax lien. 
See footnote 1, supra.  He argues that he “has taken substantial steps to resolve” his remaining tax
debts.  Applicant’s argument is not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge failed to consider
all of the evidence in the record or to show that he mis-weighed the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 14-05795 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2016).  Applicant has cited to some Hearing Office cases

that, he contends, support his effort to obtain a clearance.  We give these cases due consideration. 
However, Hearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing Office Judges or on the Appeal
Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015). 
The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing and
paying taxes, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of
those granted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.
Aug. 18, 2015).  See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173,
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  Failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant
has a problem with complying with well-established government rules and regulations.  Voluntary
compliance with such rules and regulations is essential for protecting classified information.  ISCR
Case No. 14-06686 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2016).  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The
general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests
of the national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
