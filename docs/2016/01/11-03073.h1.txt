LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on November 14, 2014, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to me on 
February 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working 
overseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the 
parties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
 
2 
 
on July 16, 2015, scheduling the hearing for August 18, 2015. The hearing was 
convened as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 26, 
2015.  
 
Evidentiary Rulings 
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five 
witnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted 
without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional 
information. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted 
without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He 
served in the U.S. military from 1979 until he retired in 2000. He seeks to retain a 
security clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college 
for a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. 
He has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult 
children.2 
 
 Applicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went 
on numerous combat missions, conducted clandestine insertions, and operated 
undercover. When he retired he became an entrepreneur and started his own 
companies. His primary company was incorporated, but Applicant had to personally 
guarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary 
company suffered significant setbacks during the recession and housing crisis of the 
later part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his 
primary company in 2009 and has been working since then as a self-employed 
contractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five 
years working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 
 
  The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR 
¶ 1.a), mortgage loans (SOR ¶ 1.c - $30,994; SOR ¶ 1.d - $351,562; SOR ¶ 1.e - 
$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 
and SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, 
and SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted 
owing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or 
otherwise resolved.

 Applicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in 
about 2008. The business ultimately failed, and the company broke the lease. The 
owner of the warehouse sued Applicant personally and obtained a $58,161 judgment 
against him (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant’s attorney is negotiating a settlement on this 
judgment.4  
 
 Applicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued 
Applicant for $160,000. They reached a settlement through arbitration in which 
Applicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but 
he was unable to pay the remainder when the company closed. The partner either 
obtained a judgment for $77,000 or sought to enforce the arbitrated settlement. 
Applicant’s attorney is negotiating a settlement for the remainder owed to the ex-
partner.5 
 
 In February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.b (alleged as $18,028 in SOR) for $10,151, which was paid in February 
2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 
that the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a 
zero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 
 
 Applicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the 
IRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 
(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes 
to his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. 
The 2014 credit reports obtained by the Government report the lien as released in 
January 2013.7 
 
 Applicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In 
April 2015, he submitted a proposed installment agreement to the IRS whereby he 
would pay an initial $915 and then $500 per month until paid. In July 2015, the IRS 
accepted Applicant’s installment agreement and added his 2014 taxes. On June 5, 
2015, Applicant paid the IRS $56,415 for his 2014 taxes. On July 9, 2015, he paid 
$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 
 
 Applicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental 
properties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant 
for an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was 
in the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to 
foreclosure. SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f allege the first ($351,562) and second ($50,688)

mortgage loans on one of the foreclosed properties. The $351,562 figure is listed on the 
credit reports as the high credit on the first mortgage loan, not a balance. The 2010 
credit report lists the account before foreclosure as $8,609 past due, with a $274,274 
balance. The more recent credit reports list the first mortgage loan as foreclosed with a 
zero balance. TransUnion reported in August 2015: “Credit grantor reclaimed collateral 
to settle defaulted mortgage[.] Foreclosure proceedings started[.]”9 
 
 The second mortgage loan is listed on the three oldest credit reports with a 
$50,688 balance. Equifax reported a $50,688 balance in the combined credit report 
from August 2015. TransUnion reported the loan as closed with a zero balance. 
Applicant’s online account snapshot of the second mortgage loan shows a zero 
balance. Applicant stated that he thought the first and second mortgage loans were 
resolved by the foreclosure. He has never been contacted by the holders of the first and 
second mortgage loans seeking a deficiency owed on the loans.10 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e alleges the mortgage loan ($271,900) on the second foreclosed 
property. The $271,900 figure is listed on the credit reports as the high credit on the 
mortgage loan, not a balance. The reports list a zero balance for the loan. The 2010 and 
2015 credit reports list the account as “Foreclosure redeemed,” and “Credit grantor 
reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage[.]” Applicant has never been contacted 
about a deficiency owed on the loan.11 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c alleges the $30,994 charged-off second mortgage loan on Applicant’s 
home. He settled the debt for $7,517, which he paid in August 2015. Applicant is current 
on the first mortgage loan on his residence and the mortgage loans on his two 
remaining investment properties.12 
 
 Applicant paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He repaid a $10,000 
loan from his former commanding officer. He borrowed $50,000 from a friend who he 
served with in the military in an effort to maintain his business. He paid the friend and 
then his friend’s widow after his friend passed away. Applicant made the last payment of 
$14,000 in August 2015.13 
 
 Applicant’s accountant, friends, and business associates recommended that he 
file bankruptcy to discharge the debts accrued from his failed business and the real 
estate collapse. He chose not to file bankruptcy because he wanted to pay his debts, 
and he was afraid that a bankruptcy would adversely affect his security clearance. He 
has been working overseas under dangerous conditions during the last five years to

earn the money that has enabled him to pay his debts. He credibly testified that it will 
take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  
 
 Applicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. He submitted numerous letters 
and several witnesses testified. Many of the authors and witnesses served with 
Applicant in special operations. His former commanding officer testified that he served 
with Applicant under conditions that the commanding officer modesty described as 
“quite stressful.” The endorsements of the witnessses and authors were unequivocal 
and exceptional.15 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible

extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant had delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay. The 
evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
7 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
  Applicant owed and still owes a lot of money, but the SOR overstated his debts. 
The evidence available to the Government (credit reports and documents submitted by 
Applicant in response to interrogatories) established that before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant settled the $18,028 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, and he paid the IRS the 
$33,882 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two 
mortgage loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.d - $351,562 and 1.e - $271,900), when the balances on 
those loans were reported as zero.  
 
  Applicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for 
his 2012 and 2013 tax years. He settled and paid the second mortgage loan on his 
home, and he paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. His attorney is 
negotiating settlements for the two judgments against him. Applicant credibly testified 
that it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. 
 
 I find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he 
took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-
faith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are 
being resolved and are under control. They occurred under circumstances that are 
unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of 
paying his debts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 
8 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Applicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. His financial problems are 
large, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve 
all his debts. His sacrifices in service to this country have earned him the time to do so. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
