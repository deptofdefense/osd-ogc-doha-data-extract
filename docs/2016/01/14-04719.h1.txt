Decision

MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 
2013 or his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013. He owes 
approximately $3,000 in past-due federal taxes for 2011 and more than $10,000 in 
delinquent state taxes. Past-due consumer credit balances totaling $7,955 from 2009 have 
not been paid. Applicant relapsed into drinking from March or April 2014 to October 2014 
after treatment for alcohol dependence in June 2013. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On February 13, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline G, Alcohol 
Consumption, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the 
action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, 
 
2 
 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
On May 7, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). 
On July 21, 2015, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
him. On July 23, 2015, I scheduled a hearing for August 17, 2015. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, 
Applicant’s personal representative requested a continuance because the investigator who 
conducted Applicant’s background investigation was not available to testify about what 
favorable information he or she garnered about Applicant. I denied the request in that 
Applicant had adequate notice of the hearing, had not filed a request before the hearing for 
the investigator’s presence, and had not shown good cause for why he could not establish 
his case without the investigator’s testimony. I advised Applicant that I would hold the 
record open for post-hearing submissions, including work and character reference 
information favorable to him. Twelve Government exhibits (GEs 1-12) were then admitted 
into evidence, GE 7 (his February 2014 credit report) over Applicant’s objection. Applicant 
objected on the basis that his credit report of June 2015 (GE 12) reflected more current 
financial information. I admitted the February 2014 credit report because Applicant’s credit 
history is relevant to an assessment of the Guideline F security concerns. Thirteen 
Applicant exhibits (AEs A-M) were admitted into evidence at the hearing without objection. 
Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on August 25, 2015. 
 
I held the record open for four weeks after the hearing for post-hearing 
documentation from Applicant. On September 21, 2015, Applicant submitted AE N, which 
was admitted into evidence. Department Counsel filed no objection by the October 5, 2015 
deadline for comment. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of February 13, 2015, Applicant had not 
filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d) or his 
state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.j). Additionally, he 
allegedly owed a $323 collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.k) and charged-off debts of $377 (SOR ¶ 
1.l) and $11,762 (SOR ¶ 1.m). Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have continued 
to consume alcohol after being diagnosed with alcohol dependence in June 2013 (SOR ¶ 
2.a) and to have received alcohol detoxification treatment in May 2013 (SOR ¶ 2.b). 
Furthermore, Applicant allegedly pleaded nolo contendere to driving under the influence 
(DUI) in May 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); was convicted of driving while ability impaired in March 
2007 (SOR ¶ 2.d); resigned from a job in December 2006 after being asked to submit to a 
blood test when suspected of intoxication (SOR ¶ 2.e); and while in the military, was 
reprimanded and required to attend an alcohol counseling program for drunken or reckless 
3 
 
driving and reckless endangerment in 2001 (SOR ¶ 2.f) and for drinking before duty in 
1989 (SOR ¶ 2.g). 
 
 When he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had not filed his federal or 
state income tax returns for the years alleged and that he owed the charged-off debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.m. He denied the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l. Concerning the Guideline 
G allegations, Applicant admitted the alcohol-related incidents in SOR ¶¶ 2.c-2.g, with the 
caveat that he had not been required to attend a 30-day alcohol counseling program in 
2001. As he clarified at the hearing, the alcohol counseling was recommended not 
required. (Tr. 31.) Applicant denied that he had been hospitalized for alcohol detoxification 
around May 2013 (SOR ¶ 2.b). He also denied the alleged diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence in June 2013 with continued drinking after that diagnosis (SOR ¶ 2.a). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old high school graduate, who has worked full time as a rigger 
for a defense contractor since November 2007. Applicant served on active duty in the 
United States military from August 1982 through August 2002. (GEs 1-3; AE A.) He held a 
secret clearance for his military duties. Applicant did not need a security clearance for his 
jobs in the civilian sector before he began his present employment. (GE 1.) 
 
Applicant was married to his first wife from 1983 to 1987 and to his second wife from 
April 1993 to October 2008. He and his second wife separated permanently in September 
2007. (GE 2.) Applicant has two children: a son now age 32 and a daughter now age 18. 
(GEs 1, 2, 9.) Applicant had no contact with his son from 1990 until November 2013. (GE 
9.) 
 
Financial 
 
 Applicant retired from the U.S. military after 20 years with an honorable discharge, 
having received several service medals and five good conduct awards. (GE 3; AEs A-I, L; 
Tr. 78-79.) Applicant worked as a civilian equipment operator at a military base from 
January 2003 to April 2004, and then as a truck driver for some private companies. In May 
2006, Applicant began working as an assistant operator for a healthcare company, but he 
quit in December 2006 after being asked to submit to a blood test. Applicant was 
unemployed from December 2006 until November 2007, when he began working for his 
present employer. (GEs 1, 2.)  
 
On November 5, 2007, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for a security clearance. He 
responded affirmatively to whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt in 
the last seven years, and to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt. 
4 
 
He disclosed one credit card debt of $1,000 from June 2007 that was pending resolution. 
(GE 2.) 
 
 A check of Applicant’s credit on November 15, 2007, revealed that Applicant was 
120 days past due in the amount of $2,125 on the credit card listed on his e-QIP. His 
account had a balance of $12,774 as of October 2007 and had been cancelled by the 
creditor. Applicant owed delinquent balances on four other credit card accounts. He was 90 
days past due for $385 on a $5,233 account balance as of November 2007, 60 days late 
for $132 on an account balance of $3,357 as of October 2007, 30 days late on an account 
with a $436 balance, and over 120 days past due for $1,308 on a $11,471 balance as of 
November 2007 (SOR ¶ 1.m). (GE 8.) 
 
 Around July 2008, Applicant moved to his current residence, which was located in 
another state closer to his work. Applicant assumed that his employer automatically 
withheld taxes for his new state of residence, and he filed no paperwork to ensure that 
state taxes were properly withheld from his wages. Applicant testified that he realized his 
error some three years later, but he then made no effort to file for withholding or to submit 
his late returns.
1
 (Tr. 143-144.) 
 
 Applicant completed another e-QIP on September 17, 2013. He responded “Yes” to 
whether he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or 
ordinance within the last seven years. He indicated that he had not paid federal income tax 
debts of $1,000 for 2009, $1,000 for 2010, and $2,000 for 2011, but that all debts would be 
satisfied in full in September 2013. He also disclosed that he had not yet filed his federal 
income tax return for tax year 2012 because he did not receive a W-2. He was working to 
resolve the issue. In response to inquiries concerning delinquencies on routine accounts, 
Applicant indicated that credit card balances from January 2009 of $4,500 (not alleged) 
and $15,000 (SOR ¶ 1.m) had been placed for collection. He also related that he was 
behind 120 days on a disputed $10,000 hospital debt in that it should have been covered 
by medical insurance. He explained that he was resubmitting his claim to his insurer. (GE 
1.) 
 
 On December 12, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that he did not file his tax 
returns for 2009 or 2010 because he did not receive the proper forms. He was on 
temporary duty for his employer for nine months. He added that any taxes owed for those 
years had been paid in full as of September 2013. Applicant admitted that he had yet to file 
his returns for tax years 2011 and 2012, again because he had not received his W-2 
statements and needed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms. Applicant planned to “re-
file” the returns and to pay any taxes owed. As for his delinquent consumer credit card 
accounts, Applicant stated that he was recently billed $1,500 on his military exchange 
credit card account. His effort to make a payment in person was unsuccessful because the 
debt was in collection and no longer in the creditor’s system. Applicant claimed that he was 
                                                 
1 
According to Applicant, at some point after he moved, no state taxes were withheld from his pay for either his 
previous or current states of residency. He admitted that he did not file income tax returns to either state. (Tr. 
142-144.) As of his hearing in August 2015, no state taxes were being withheld from his pay. (Tr. 144.) 
5 
 
making payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. As for the $10,000 hospital debt, he was 
awaiting a copy of his bill so that he could submit it to his secondary insurer. (GE 9.) 
 
Applicant was re-interviewed by an OPM investigator on January 9, 2014. He 
indicated that he had established a payment plan to address the military exchange credit 
card account in collection (not alleged in SOR). (GE 10.)  A check of Applicant’s credit on 
February 27, 2014, revealed a $206 debt in collection since June 2010 (not alleged) and a 
$323 retail debt in collection since December 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Additionally, the credit 
card account in SOR ¶ 1.m had been charged off for $11,762. Equifax was reporting a 
$7,632 balance on the account as of February 2014, but also no payments since June 
2009. (GE 7.) 
 
 In May 2015, Applicant received the wage and earnings statements needed to file 
his delinquent tax returns. He explained the delay in receipt of needed income statements 
to an issue with the postal service and with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service 
(DFAS) sending his documents to a wrong address. (Tr. 73.) On June 8, 2015, Applicant 
paid the IRS $2,000 for tax year 2011 in response to a tax bill of $5,000 for that year. (AE 
M; Tr. 119, 123-124, 149.) As of August 17, 2015, Applicant had not filed any of his 
delinquent federal or state income tax returns because he lacked the funds to pay taxes 
owed. (Tr. 73, 119-121.) Applicant is looking for help from a professional because he does 
not understand all the issues with respect to filing his returns. (Tr. 122.) 
 
 No state taxes were being withheld from Applicant’s income as of August 2015. (Tr. 
144.) On September 2, 2015, Applicant submitted an employee withholding certificate to 
have state taxes plus an additional $5 per pay period withheld from his pay. (AE N.) 
Applicant believes that he owes more than $10,000 in past-due state taxes for tax years 
2008 through 2013. (Tr. 125, 145.) 
  
As of June 30, 2015, Equifax was reporting the $323 collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.k) as 
unpaid since February 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Applicant may have paid the debt, but he cannot 
find any record confirming payment and does not remember paying the debt. (Tr. 75, 126.) 
Available credit information confirms that Applicant has been making payments since May 
2013 to reduce the balance to $11,697 of a closed credit union account (not alleged). The 
monthly minimum payment is around $200. In April 2015, he paid off another account for 
less than its full balance. In March 2015, he paid off the $377 debt in SOR ¶ 1.l after it had 
been charged off. (GE 12; Tr. 76.) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.m had been dropped from his 
credit record (GE 12), although there is no evidence of payments. Applicant is still 
investigating who holds the debt since it has been transferred or sold to another collection 
agency. (Tr. 128.) Applicant is paying $300 a month on a signature loan with a credit union. 
(Tr. 149.) 
 
Applicant’s hourly wage with the defense contractor is currently $29.50. (Tr. 145.) 
His rent is $1,349 per month. (Tr. 148.) Since his divorce, he has been paying $600 a 
month in child support for his daughter, which is taken from his military retirement income. 
He continued to send his daughter $600 a month despite her emancipation because she 
plans to attend college in the fall of 2015. Applicant also covers his daughter’s medical 
6 
 
insurance and survivor benefit from his military income. (Tr. 146-147.) Applicant does not 
manage his own finances from a household budget. He pays bills when they come in. He 
has not had any financial counseling apart from some conversations with family members. 
(Tr. 130-131.) 
 
Alcohol 
 
 Applicant started drinking alcohol socially at age 21. (GE 9.) Applicant had some 
issues with alcohol while he was in the military. Around 1989, he was awarded non-judicial 
punishment in part for drinking before duty, albeit not to intoxication. (Tr. 95-96.) In 2000 or 
2001, he consumed several beers while out at bars with other servicemen. He was stopped 
by local police, and after taking a breathalyzer, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated 
(DWI). The matter was referred to the military for disposition. Approximately two months 
later, he appeared before a non-judicial proceeding where he was found guilty. He was 
sentenced to a reduction in grade (suspended), to forfeiture of half his pay for two months, 
and to 45 days of restriction or extra duty. Applicant was also referred to an alcohol 
awareness program. (GEs 9, 11.) Applicant completed a 30-day program, which he found 
of little benefit to him, and he continued drinking in his previous pattern. (GE 9.)  
 
Around December 2006, Applicant was suspected by his then employer of being 
intoxicated at work and asked to take a blood test. Applicant had consumed alcohol the 
previous evening, but he denies that he had consumed any alcohol before reporting for 
duty. Applicant resigned from his job out of anger while waiting for a taxi to drive him to the 
testing site. (GEs 3, 9; Tr. 96-97.) 
 
In March 2007, Applicant drank to intoxication while visiting his sister. While driving 
home, he pulled off the travel lane because he realized he was too intoxicated to drive 
safely. The police found him in his vehicle and arrested him for DUI after he refused to 
submit to a sobriety test or a breathalyzer. In December 2007, Applicant was convicted of a 
reduced charge of driving while impaired and fined $300 plus $80 court costs. (GEs 2, 10, 
11; Tr. 98-99.) 
   
Applicant listed the then pending March 2007 DUI on his November 2007 e-QIP, 
and he discussed the incident with an OPM investigator on January 23, 2008. During that 
interview, Applicant volunteered that he had received 30 days of counseling following non-
judicial punishment for a DWI in 2000 or 2001. Applicant admitted that he had continued to 
consume alcohol after the March 2007 DUI at the rate of two to twelve beers a week, 
mostly on the weekends. (GE 11.) 
 
Applicant’s drinking increased around the time of his divorce in the fall of 2008. (Tr. 
94.) In late May 2009, Applicant was stopped by the police on suspicion of drunk driving. 
He had been drinking and refused to submit to field sobriety tests. He was charged with 
simple assault and with DUI/first offense. The assault charge for stumbling into a police 
officer was dismissed. (GE 6; Tr. 100.) Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to DUI. He was 
placed on probation for one year and ordered to perform 10 hours of community service, 
complete DWI school, and pay a $780.50 fine. In June 2009, there was a change in 
7 
 
disposition, and his case was transferred to the department of motor vehicles. His driver’s 
license was suspended for three months. (GEs 6, 9; Tr. 99.) According to Applicant, he 
was contacted by a probation officer around late June 2009 and was told that the charges 
had been dropped. (GE 9.) However, available court records show that a bench warrant 
was issued in July 2009 and that Applicant still owed $780.50. (GE 6.) 
 
Applicant stopped frequenting bars after his arrest in 2009, but he continued to 
consume beer and hard liquor in his home. (Tr. 102.) By May 2013, he was drinking an 
average of five to seven alcohol beverages every night, usually to intoxication. Recognizing 
that he needed help to overcome his alcohol problem, Applicant sought treatment from a 
physician affiliated with a military health clinic. (GE 3; Tr. 104-105.) 
 
In late May 2013, Applicant underwent three days of alcohol detoxification before 
being treated for diagnosed alcohol dependence in a partial hospitalization program from 
June 4, 2013, to June 20, 2013. (GE 5; Tr. 91-92.) He participated in daily psycho-
educational and psychotherapy groups focusing in part on relapse prevention coping skills. 
He attended 12-step groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and anger management groups. 
He was open to attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and in the opinion of a 
staff therapist, Applicant “put forth great effort and displayed leadership in group and 
individual therapy.” Applicant maintained abstinence while in the program, confirmed by 
weekly random toxicology screens. Aftercare plans included attendance in an intensive 
outpatient program at the facility three nights a week starting immediately on discharge, 
medication management through his physician at the military health clinic, and participation 
in at least four or five AA meetings a week. (GE 4; Tr. 107-108.) Applicant requested the 
aftercare outpatient program. (Tr. 110.) He understood that he was an alcoholic, even 
though no one on staff told him that he had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence. (Tr. 
108-109.) 
 
Applicant returned to work following his discharge after being absent from May 29, 
2013, to June 22, 2013, for his treatment. On June 26, 2013, his employer informed the 
DOD about his recent treatment “for excessive alcohol use,” and his current attendance in 
an outpatient program and AA. (GE 5.) Applicant went to AA for about three months. (Tr. 
111.) He stopped attending because he felt he could maintain sobriety on his own. (Tr. 
111-112.) 
 
On September 17, 2013, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which he disclosed his 
alcohol counseling while in the military in 2000; his alcohol treatment in June 2013; and his 
last arrest for DUI, which he indicated occurred in January 2008 [sic]. Applicant indicated 
that the charges from his latest arrest had been dropped. (GE 1.) 
 
When interviewed by an authorized investigator for the OPM on December 12, 
2013, Applicant explained that he voluntarily sought treatment in 2013 after discussing his 
declining health with a physician. He indicated that he had not been formally diagnosed 
with alcohol abuse or alcoholism. However, he had maintained sobriety since his 
treatment. (GE 9.) 
 
8 
 
On January 9, 2014, Applicant was re-interviewed by an OPM investigator about the 
fact that he had been issued a written warning from his employer for taking excessive sick 
leave before he entered alcohol treatment. He was also asked about his March 2007 arrest 
for DUI, which he had not reported on his September 2013 e-QIP due to oversight. (GE 
10.) 
 
After about nine months of sobriety, Applicant relapsed into drinking alcohol around 
March or April 2014. Applicant attributes his relapse to isolating himself and to family 
issues. His mother was not doing well and had to move in with his sister. (Tr. 134.) 
Concerning the extent of his alcohol consumption, Applicant testified, “Once you pick up 
that first drink, you’re right back where you started, and that’s the best way I can tell you.” 
(Tr. 114.) 
 
Applicant had his last drink around October 13, 2014.
2
 He stopped drinking after he 
was asked by his employer to submit to a breathalyzer, which he refused on the basis of 
union guidelines. Applicant denies that he consumed alcohol within eight hours of when he 
reported to work on that occasion, but he admits that he had a serious drinking problem at 
that time. (Tr. 89-90, 101, 136-137.) Applicant was suspended from work following the 
incident. (Tr. 90.) He resumed his affiliation with AA, going to meetings daily and working 
the program. (Tr. 136-137.) Applicant obtained an AA sponsor around December 2014.(GE 
3; Tr. 115, 135.) 
 
As of August 2015, Applicant was committed to AA and to maintaining his sobriety. 
(Tr. 80.) He attends AA meetings on a daily basis for the most part. (Tr. 116.) He has two 
home groups, provides rides to others, makes coffee, and participates in speaking 
engagements. (Tr. 79.) He recently received an AA coin marking 10 months of abstinence. 
(Tr. 80.) His sponsor for the past eight months has three or four years of sobriety. (Tr. 136.) 
Applicant also has a temporary sponsor, who is helping him with step 4 of the AA program, 
which is making a moral inventory. (Tr. 116.) Applicant does not fear another relapse 
because he is “working the steps and [he is] doing the program.” (Tr. 133.) Applicant has a 
close relationship with his family, which he finds helpful to his sobriety. He is actively 
involved in his daughter’s life. He was estranged from his son for many years, but they are 
again in contact. (Tr. 80-81.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
                                                 
2 
Applicant indicated on December 31, 2014, that he last used alcohol on October 15, 2014. (GE 3.) At his 
hearing, he testified he consumed his last drink of alcohol a couple of days prior to October 15, 2014. (Tr. 
114.)

disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

 Applicant had not filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 
2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d) or his state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2013 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.j) by the February 13, 2015 SOR. The record before me does not include 
any records from the IRS or the state showing the amount of tax delinquency. On his 
September 2013 e-QIP, Applicant estimated his IRS tax delinquency at $1,000 for 2009, 
$1,000 for 2010, and $2,000 for 2011. He indicated that his tax liability for 2012 was 
unknown since he had not filed his return. In May 2015, Applicant paid $2,000 toward a 
federal tax debt of $5,000 for 2011. Even assuming that he has paid his federal tax debts 
for 2009 and 2010, he has not yet shown that he filed any of his delinquent federal or state 
returns. Applicant testified that he owes more than $10,000 in past-due state income taxes 
because he did not have income withheld for state taxes. Additionally, Applicant’s credit 
report shows that while he was making payments to a credit union on a closed credit card 
account, he had yet to resolve a $323 debt in collection since 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.k). Applicant 
denied the debt on the basis of payment, but he provided no corroborating documentation, 
and he cannot recall paying the debt. Even if that debt has been paid, he does not dispute 
an outstanding liability on the credit card account in SOR ¶ 1.m, which was originally 
charged off for $11,762 and had a $7,632 reported balance as of February 2014. The $377 
collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.l was paid, but not until March 2015. Three disqualifying 
conditions under AG ¶ 19 are established: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required 
or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply. The accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.m became delinquent over five years 
ago, but there is no proof they have been resolved. The retail credit card account in SOR ¶ 
1.l became delinquent in June 2014, so it is a relatively recent debt. Furthermore, Applicant 
has a pattern of persistent noncompliance with his federal and state income tax filing and 
payment obligations.  
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem 
were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” is minimally established. Applicant had to pay 
child support at $600 a month from 2008 until his daughter turned 18 in February 2015. 
However, his military retirement income has been sufficient to cover his child support, and 
to the extent that child support compromised his finances, it would not mitigate his income 
tax issues. Address issues with DFAS and the postal service aside, Applicant did not act 
responsibly when he failed to file tax returns and proper state tax withholding documents. 
 
11 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” both address efforts to resolve financial issues of security 
concern. Applicant’s satisfaction of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l in March 2015 warrants a 
favorable finding as to that debt. Applicant is also credited with paying the IRS $2,000 in 
June 2015. Yet, there is no evidence of any recent payments toward the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.m. He still owes $3,000 in federal taxes for 2011. His federal tax indebtedness for 2012 is 
not in the record. His outstanding state tax delinquency exceeds $10,000, and he has not 
yet filed any of his state tax returns. Concerning his financial stability going forward, 
Applicant reports some discretionary income since he has given up drinking alcohol. He 
has given priority to paying off a closed credit card account that had been delinquent. The 
DOHA Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he has paid 
off each debt in the SOR, but he needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his debts and 
that he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. See ISCR 07-06482 (App. Bd. 
May 21, 2008). His post-hearing completion of the state tax withholding form is a significant 
first step, but it is not enough to fully mitigate the financial judgment concerns raised by his 
noncompliance with his federal and state tax filing and payment obligations for several 
years. So too, Applicant has not yet established a plan to pay the sizeable credit card 
delinquency in SOR ¶ 1.m. The financial considerations concerns are not fully mitigated. 
 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
 The security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG ¶ 21: 
 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness. 
 
Applicant was awarded non-judicial punishment while he was in the military for 
drinking before duty around 1989 and for a DWI around 2000, but alcohol largely became 
a problem for him in the last decade. In December 2006, he was suspected of being under 
the influence of alcohol on the job and asked by his employer to submit to a blood test. His 
decision to resign from his employment rather than submit to the test suggests, but does 
not prove, that he was under the influence on the job. Applicant admits that he had 
consumed alcohol the previous evening, but not that morning. Whether or not he drank 
alcohol before reporting to work, alcohol was clearly becoming a problem for him. After he 
was convicted of driving while impaired in March 2007, he continued to drink up to 12 
beers a week, mostly on the weekends. Two years later, he pleaded nolo contendere to a 
May 2009 DUI charge. Applicant stopped frequenting bars after his arrest in 2009, but he 
continued to consume beer and hard liquor. By May 2013, he was drinking an average of 
five to seven alcohol beverages nightly at home, usually to intoxication. In late May 2013, 
Applicant underwent three days of alcohol detoxification before being treated for diagnosed 
alcohol dependence in a partial hospitalization program from June 4, 2013, to June 20, 
2013. Applicant was abstinent for about nine months after his discharge before a serious 
relapse in March or April 2014. He continued to consume alcohol until approximately 
12 
 
October 13, 2014, when he was asked by his employer to submit to an alcohol test 
because he was under the influence. As to the amount and frequency of his consumption 
when he relapsed, Applicant would only state that once he picked up that first drink, he was 
right back where he started. The following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 22 are 
established to a greater or lesser extent: 
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the 
influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other 
incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an 
alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an 
intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or as alcohol 
dependent;
3
 
  
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent;  
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical 
social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment 
program; and 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of 
an alcohol rehabilitation program. 
 
 Given Applicant’s serious relapse after completing treatment for diagnosed alcohol 
dependence, AG ¶ 23(a) cannot reasonably apply. It provides as follows: 
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
                                                 
3 
Without some proof that Applicant was impaired by alcohol at work in December 2006, AG ¶ 22(b) is not 
established with regard to that incident. However, Applicant testified at his hearing that he was asked to take a 
breathalyzer at work in October 2014. While he did not take the breathalyzer on the advice of his union, he 
was suspended from work after the incident (Tr. 90), and it led him to stop drinking and return to AA. (Tr. 137.) 
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which 
conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under 
Directive Section 6.3. 
  
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 
24, 2003)). AG ¶ 22(b) applies to the October 2014 incident. 
13 
 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment. 
 
 Applicant’s successful completion of the partial hospitalization program in June 2013 
is evidence of action taken to overcome his alcohol dependency problem under AG ¶ 
23(b), and it fulfills the treatment program required under AG ¶ 23(d). AG ¶¶ 23(b) and 
23(d) provide as follows: 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible 
use (if an alcohol abuser); and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization 
and has received favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical 
professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
 At his discharge in June 2013, Applicant appeared to have a favorable prognosis. 
According to a staff therapist, Applicant had put forth great effort and leadership in his 
recovery and was free of addictive substances with more insight into his addiction and 
increased coping skills to prevent relapse. He was discharged to continue his recovery in 
an intensive outpatient program at the facility. The evidentiary record is largely silent as to 
the nature and extent of Applicant’s participation in the outpatient program. He attended 
AA only to stop after three months because he felt that he could handle sobriety on his 
own. Without the support of AA, he relapsed in March or April 2014 and drank alcohol for 
the next six months. 
 
 Since resuming his affiliation with AA in October 2014, Applicant has attended daily 
meetings except on some weekends when he has been at work. Active in the AA program, 
he is currently working on step 4, which he correctly identified as taking a moral inventory. 
He has taken on a temporary second sponsor to help him in that regard. He has 
maintained abstinence for at least ten months as of his security clearance hearing. His 
present involvement in AA includes speaking engagements and providing rides to 
meetings. While this level of commitment to the AA program increases the likelihood of 
Applicant being able to maintain his sobriety, ten months of abstinence is not enough of a 
pattern to overcome the alcohol consumption concerns, particularly in light of the duration 
of his relapse in 2014 and the lack of any current prognosis by a duly qualified medical 
professional or licensed clinical social worker. Applicant’s AA participation is encouraging, 
but it is too soon to conclude with confidence that he is fully rehabilitated. 
14 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
4
 
 
The analyses under Guidelines F and G are incorporated in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but 
some warrant additional comment. Applicant is credited for seeking alcohol rehabilitation 
treatment in 2013 when he realized he had an alcohol problem. His relapse from March or 
April 2014 to October 2014 shows the magnitude of his dependency problem. Applicant did 
not show good judgment in dealing with his federal and state income tax obligations. While 
he may have erroneously assumed that his employer would automatically transfer state 
withholdings when he moved in 2008, he realized some three years later that was not the 
case. He took no action before his security clearance hearing to file the proper income tax 
withholding documents. Whether he could afford to pay the taxes owed, he had a separate 
obligation to file timely federal and state income tax returns. His complacency regarding the 
tax issues is incompatible with the judgment that must be demanded of persons granted 
security clearance eligibility. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an 
applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or 
renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 
1990). For the reasons already discussed, grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a-1.k:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:  Against Applicant 
                                                 
4 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
15 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline G:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
   Subparagraph 2.a:  Against Applicant
5
 
   Subparagraph 2.b:  For Applicant 
   Subparagraph 2.c-2.d: Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 2.e:  For Applicant 
   Subparagraph 2.f:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 2.g:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Treatment is viewed favorably, especially when undertaken voluntarily as in Applicant’s case. SOR ¶ 1.a is 
found against Applicant because he consumed alcohol after being diagnosed with and treated for alcohol 
dependence.
