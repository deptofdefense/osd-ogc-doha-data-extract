Decision
______________
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 7 November 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 4
March 2015, and I convened a hearing 20 April 2015. DOHA received the transcript
(Tr.) 27 April 2015.
Applicant’s IRS records (GE 2; AE C) show that Applicant’s pay was garnished in April and May 2008 for tax3
year 2004. He made two miscellaneous payments of different amounts in June 2008 and three payments in
November 2008. He made one payment in December 2008, before making a lump-sum payment of $8,700
in December 2008, at the time he established an installment agreement. He never actually paid $415 monthly.
It seems that the expected payment was $450 monthly. Beginning in February 2009, Applicant’s payments
ranged from $445 to $550 monthly. He made regular payments from February to June 2009, then missed July
2009. He made payments from August to October 2009, then missed November 2009. He made the
December 2009 payment, then missed January 2010. He made two payments in February 2010, missed
March 2010, then made a payment in April 2010. He made no more payments until August 2010, when he
made a double payment. In the meantime, the IRS had been seizing his income tax refunds for ensuing years.
The IRS took some action against Applicant in August 2011, and Applicant made a $400 payment in4
September 2011. Beginning in January 2012, Applicant made assorted payments of varying amounts until
November 2012, when the combination of payments and credits transferred in from other tax years reduced
the 2004 tax liability to zero.

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.a and 1.c-1g. He denied SOR 1.b, 1.h,
and 1.I as having been paid. He is a 59-year-old foreman employed by a defense
contractor since January 2013. He was previously employed as a cable installer from
April 2000 to December 2012. Applicant served in the U.S. military from October 1975
until November 1997, when he retired in paygrade E-7. His current monthly retirement is
$1,800. Applicant’s wife resigned from her Government employment in 2004, before she
reached retirement age. Since then, she has been employed as a commissioned sales
person. She estimates her annual pay at $80,000-120,000, but not spread evenly
throughout the year (Tr. 105).
Applicant admits receiving a February 2009 SOR alleging $66,000 in delinquent
debt, of which $24,000 was to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He had a security
clearance hearing before DOHA in May 2009, and received a favorable decision from
DOHA in July 2009 (GE 6). Except as noted below, I incorporate the July 2009 decision
by reference.
The seven delinquent debts alleged in February 2009 essentially broke down into
three comparatively small debts that Applicant had resolved completely by the date of
the hearing and three larger accounts for which Applicant had entered into repayment
plans with the creditors. Two of the debts were to the same creditor, for a credit card
and a home-equity loan, and were combined for a total debt of almost $38,000. The IRS
debt had grown to $35,000 and the IRS had begun to garnish Applicant’s wages.
Applicant paid $8,700 on the account, the IRS released the lien and stopped the
garnishment, and Applicant agreed to pay $415 monthly (GE 6). Applicant continued to
make payments on his delinquent taxes.  However, after the double payment in August3
2010, he made no further payment until February 2011, then skipped payments until
June 2011. He then missed payments through August 2011.4
Applicant was to pay $750 monthly from February 2009 through September 2009, then make a lump-sum5
payment of $27,000.
Regarding the delinquent home-equity obligation: Applicant made the February 2009 payment, but then6
missed the March and April 2009 payments. He made the May and June 2009 payments, but missed the July
and August 2009 payments. He paid September and October 2009, missed November 2009, then paid
December 2009. He made no payment from January to March 2010, then made a $700 payment in April 2010.
He made no payment from May to July 2010, then made a $750 payment in August 2010, 11 months after
the payment was supposed to have been made (AE E). Applicant then stopped making any payments on the
account, much less the lump-sum payment agreed to, because his wife had supposedly discovered that the
bank to whom they owed the debt was on a U.S. Government watch list as a result of alleged foreign
connections (Answer). Applicant did not resume payments on the debt until October 2013, when he made a
$4,000 payment. He made $5,000 payments in November 2013, December 2013, February 2014, and March
2014 (GE 3). Applicant described the latter two payments as the January and February 2014 payments.
Applicant then made $5,000 payments in April 2014, May 2014, and June 2014 (AE E). Applicant paid
$49,950 total by June 2014. In August 2014, Applicant requested a payoff balance from the creditor. He
itemized the October 2013-June 2014 payments ($39,000), but included all the check copies from February
2009-June 2014 (another $5,950). He also included a hand-written accounting, showing only the $39,000
payment and a supposed overpayment of $2,901.
Applicant’s mother-in-law died in 2012 (Tr. 114).7
3
To resolve the home-equity loan/credit card, Applicant agreed to pay $33,000 by
making eight token payments with a large balloon payment in September 2009,  to be5
paid with a large commission payment that Applicant’s wife was expecting. The large
commission never materialized. Nor did the promised payments, at least on the time
line agreed to. Applicant was unable to make the monthly payments as scheduled,
taking 17 months to make the preliminary portion of the payments. He then stopped
making payments for over three years.6
Finally, Applicant agreed to resolve a $3,800 delinquent credit card debt by
paying $200 monthly until the debt was paid. GE 3 and 4 appear to show that the debt
was paid in due course as promised.
Although the Administrative Judge in the 2009 decision found Applicant’s wife’s
income projections for the remainder of 2009 to be overly optimistic, he nevertheless
considered that the combined $700,000 equity in the three homes they owned would be
adequate to resolve the home-equity debt if they were unable to make the promised
lump-sum payment in October 2009. He certainly assumed that this debt would be
satisfied in due course. He also considered that Applicant and his wife would have fewer
pressures on their finances because they would have fewer elderly parents to care for.
Both of Applicant’s parents and his father-in-law had died after challenging health issues
which contributed to Applicant’s financial problems.  However, even the Administrative7
Judge’s assessment of Applicant’s home equity turned out to be overly optimistic.
Although he has $500,000 equity in his personal residence, the inherited properties
turned out to be essentially worthless over time.
           
Beyond the 2009 DOHA decision, the SOR alleges, and Government exhibits
(GE 3, 4) establish eight delinquent debts totaling over $32,000. All the debts are new
4
since the 2009 hearing, except for SOR 1.e and 1.f, Applicant’s unresolved tax
delinquencies from 2006 and 2007. Applicant’s credit reports (GE 3, 4), his response to
DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and a post-hearing exhibit (AE E) reflect accounts that
were delinquent after his 2009 hearing that are now current, as well as belated efforts to
satisfy a debt from the 2009 hearing.
Applicant admits five debts over $30,000. He denied three debts totaling almost
$2,000, claiming they were paid. AE D documented that SOR debt 1.b was paid in
November 2012. Applicant’s Answer documented that SOR debt 1.h was paid in June
2014 (Attachment 4), and SOR debt 1.I was paid in May 2014 (Attachment 5). Applicant
reported his prior security clearance hearing on his May 2013 clearance application (GE
1), as well as reporting the financial problems alleged at SOR 1.c-1.f.  He reported the
delinquent debt at SOR 1.g in his March 2014 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE
2). During two subject interviews in July 2013 (GE 2), Applicant disclosed that he had
experienced financial hardship over the last six or seven years, because his wife works
on commission and they were dealing with their ailing elderly parents. His adult son and
his spouse had moved into Applicant’s home, resulting in additional financial pressure
between 2011 and 2013 (Tr. 46). He discussed SOR debts 1.c-1.i. He also discussed
his 2009 clearance hearing, and the remaining unresolved debt from that hearing—the
home-equity loan.
In February 2014, the creditor for SOR debt 1.c accepted Applicant’s proposal to
pay $175 twice monthly to resolve an outstanding $5,300 debt. The bi-monthly
payments were to begin March 2014 (Answer, Attachment 1). Applicant documented
the first March 2014 payment in his response to DOHA interrogatories. Applicant and
his wife both testified that the monthly payments were $350 (Tr. 57, 95). However,
Applicant’s documents suggest that the $175 payment was a monthly, not bi-monthly,
figure, or was at least not made on a regular basis. Under the terms of the agreement,
Applicant should have made 28 payments from March 2014 through April 2015.
However, an April 2015 letter from the creditor (AE F) reports that Applicant has paid
$2,975 through April—or 17 $175 payments. Applicant’s current balance is about
$2,370.
In September 2014, Applicant began making catch-up payments on his
delinquent mortgage (SOR 1.d). He made monthly payments of $2,900 from September
through December 2014, $3,000 in January 2015, $2,850 in February 2015, $2,900 in
March 2015, and $1,200 in April 2015. Applicant claims that he is no longer in arrears
on his mortgage.
AE C and H reflect Applicant’s payment records for his 2006 and 2007 Federal
income tax returns. The current delinquent balances are essentially as alleged in SOR
1.e and 1.f. The payment records reflect that the expected monthly payment has been
reduced to $250-300 over time because Applicant was unable to make the payments as
required. The payment records also reflect that Applicant has had gaps in his payments,
some for significant periods of time. Applicant’s wife confirmed that the payments have
not always been consistent (Tr. 100).
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).8

In December 2014, Applicant agreed to pay the creditor for SOR debt 1.g $100
monthly on a $576 debt, beginning in January 2015. Although Applicant should have
made the payments from January 2015 through April 2015, he did not produce any
evidence at hearing that the payments had been made.
Applicant’s coworker, who testified for him at his 2009 hearing (GE 2), considers
him honest and trustworthy (AE B). He provided no other work or character references,
or evidence of community involvement. He has received no credit or financial
counseling.
His March 2014 personal financial statement (GE 2) shows $655 positive
monthly cash flow. He also has $4,000 set aside to settle his debts (Tr. 62). He
promises to pay his delinquent debts, but acknowledges that he has made that promise
before without following through (Tr. 70-71).
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person’s suitability for
access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is
not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case
can be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or
denial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the
burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels deciding any
reasonable doubt about an Applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8

Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has had significant financial
problems since before his March 2009 clearance hearing, and has continued to have
them since.  Without suggesting that Applicant and his wife deliberately mislead the9
Administrative Judge about their future financial prospects, the fact remains that the
Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant was well on his way to resolving his
financial problems. However, Applicant did not resolve all the financial problems from
that hearing, and acquired new financial problems in the ensuing years. He attributes
those financial problems to the same issues he cited in his 2009 hearing: caring for
family members (including those who had died before his 2009 hearing) and his wife’s
inconsistent income flow.
In addition, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial
considerations. His financial difficulties are recent, not infrequent, and ongoing.  While10
the circumstances that caused the indebtedness that was addressed in the 2009
hearing were beyond his control, he cited those same factors as the reason his finances
remained problematic after his clearance was granted, including acquiring new debt
after the hearing and letting those accounts fall delinquent. He cannot be considered to
have acted responsibly in addressing his debts under the circumstances, because the
debts have lingered for many years with incomplete resolution or inconsistent efforts
toward resolution.  Further, Applicant’s most recent spurt of activity seems to be driven11
by his subject interview in February 2014 (GE 2), and while the actions he took may
constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts initially, his inability to follow through
on making the required payments on a regular basis undermine those efforts.  12
The concern with Applicant is that while he now promises to address his
delinquent debts, he made that same promise to the Administrative Judge in 2009
without completely following through. Moreover, more than 10 years have passed since
his wife moved to a job that pays only commissions, yet Applicant and his wife have not
presented a budget or plan that accounts for the vagaries in her income while resolving
their debts. The Government is not the collection agent of last resort. The Government
expects applicants to deal with their delinquent debts because of their legal and moral
obligation to do so, not because they face the risk of adverse administrative action. He
has established no meaningful timetable for their resolution. He has not received credit
or financial counseling. He certainly has not demonstrated that these delinquent debts
¶20© the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that13
the problem is being resolved or is under control;
7
are being resolved in an expeditious manner.  Further, he has only one favorable13
character and work reference to establish a “whole-person” analysis supporting a
favorable clearance action, inadequate under the circumstances to overcome the
security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. I conclude Guideline F against
Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
