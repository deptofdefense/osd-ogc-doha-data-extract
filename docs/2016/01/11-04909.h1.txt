DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 5, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance. On April 30, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2015. The Defense 
 
2 
 
 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on September 3, 
2015, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on September 22, 2015.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
4. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. The record of 
the proceedings was left open until October 5, 2015, to provide Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documents. He timely submitted documents that were 
marked as AE G thought I. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2015. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
 Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d 
and 1.e. Applicant had no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and those 
allegations were withdrawn.1 
 
 Department Counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to reflect that the debt 
was owed to a state instead of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant had no 
objection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector 
for a defense contractor. He has been working for that contractor in the Middle East 
since May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of 
years. He earned a general educational development certificate in 1996 and an 
associate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in 
2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 
 
Excluding the withdrawn allegations, the SOR alleged that Applicant had three 
delinquent debts totaling $64,168 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). In his Answer to the SOR, he 
denied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  
 
In 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis 
and hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month 
in disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the 
disability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but 
did not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated

he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments 
stopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 
 
A credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had 
been placed for collection in the amount of $20,955 (SOR ¶ 1.c). This delinquent 
account was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started 
repaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later 
that year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of 
$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully 
repaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the 
debt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 
 
In 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was 
exempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and 
he incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he 
disclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ 
1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid 
through monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with 
the IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  
  
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had 
not yet received a document from the state showing it was paid. He stated that the 
deductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, 
he also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been 
consistently making monthly payments of $375 since August 2012. As of September 
2015, his IRS account balance for 2008 was $3,961 and for 2009 was $17,124. The 
account transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 
  
Besides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, 
2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no 
other delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about 
$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that 
reflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 The evidence established that Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he 
was unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in 
this case. 
 
 Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
6 
 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
Applicant incurred delinquent debts because he continued to receive disability 
benefits after his income exceeded earning limitations and because he failed to pay 
taxes on income earned in 2008 and 2009. These events do not constitute 
circumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. 
 
Applicant has resolved the state tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.a and the disability 
overpayment in SOR ¶ 1.c. He has established a repayment plan to resolve the 
delinquent federal taxes in SOR ¶ 1.b. He has been consistently making payments 
under that plan for the past three years. The record established that his financial 
problems are under control and are being resolved. He has not incurred any recent 
delinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) 
apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
In the adjudication process, an administrative judge must carefully weigh a 
number of variables known as the whole-person concept. Available information about 
the applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching 
a determination.11 In this case, I gave due consideration to the information about 
Applicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating 
evidence, outweigh the security concerns at issue. Applicant met his burden of 
persuasion to mitigate the security concerns.  
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
                                                          
11 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d-1.e:  Withdrawn  
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Clearance is granted.
