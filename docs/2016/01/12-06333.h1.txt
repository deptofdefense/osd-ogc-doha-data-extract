GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 25, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application.1 On February 7, 2014, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He 
responded to the interrogatories on March 10, 2014.2 On October 28, 2014, the DOD 
CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information

(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as the receipt in the case file is 
undated. On November 25, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on March 11, 2015. The case was initially 
assigned to another administrative judge on March 30, 2015, but was reassigned to me 
on July 9, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 31, 2015, and I convened the 
hearing as scheduled on August 26, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and no Applicant 
exhibits (AE) were admitted into evidence without objection. One Administrative Exhibit 
was also admitted. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 
3, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took 
advantage of that opportunity. He timely submitted a number of documents, which were 
marked as AE A through AE AA, and admitted into evidence without objection. The 
record closed on September 23, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f.).3 Applicant’s 
answers are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is an American 
Merchant Mariner who has been serving in various licensed engineering positions 
aboard a number of different ships operated by several companies, since April 1991.4 
He has been with his current employer since September 2011.5 He is a June 1975 high 
school graduate.6 After attending a service academy for six months, Applicant tendered 
his resignation and withdrew from it in January 1976.7 He attended several different 
                                                          
3
 During the hearing, Department Counsel determined that ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.f. referred to the same debt during 
different time periods. Accordingly, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing ¶ 1.f. There being 
no objection, the SOR was amended and ¶ 1.f. was withdrawn. See Tr. at 87-88.

universities and finally received a bachelor’s of science degree in marine engineering in 
April 1982.8 He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1976 and remained in the active 
reserve until he was honorably discharged in April 1982.9 Applicant received a reserve 
commission in April 1982,10 and he received another honorable discharge in June 1994 
when he underwent a reduction in force (RIF).11 He was granted a secret security 
clearance at some point while he was with the U.S. Navy.12 Applicant was married in 
January 1992 and divorced in January 2002.13 He married his second wife in February 
2010.14 He has one son, born in 1993.15 
 
Financial Considerations 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having issues with his finances, but he 
referred to several factors which contributed to financial problems over the years: (1) his 
son was born with two handicaps, including achondroplastic dwarfism, or 
achondroplasia, and broad spectrum autism; (2) in 1999 or 2000, he and his first wife 
downsized their residence and he was forced to store his papers and records; (3) he 
spent various periods at sea, and upon his return, his papers and presumably his mail 
would be in piles awaiting his attention; (4) his first wife, an independently wealthy 
woman, refused to cook and would not permit him to cook, causing extra costs; (5) 
although he was divorced in 2002 (for financial reasons), he and his first wife continued 
to reside together until 2004, when he relocated and moved in with his brother; (6) he 
sends his first wife at least $300 per month for his son, purchased televisions and game 
systems, and maintains health and life insurance for his son; (7) he pays for care and 
maintenance for his son; (8) he was unemployed between ship assignments, and 
especially during the Fall of 2008 when he lost his license; (9) he supports his second 
wife’s stepson and half-brother; (10) his second wife became disabled with rheumatoid 
arthritis and has been out of work since October 2012; (11) his second wife has been on 
disability since April 2013; (12) her monthly net income dropped from $3,000 to 
approximately $2,000; (13) Applicant has been disorganized since 2002 due to 
numerous moves and periods (between a few days and six months) at sea; (14) 
Applicant has made some unspecified bad financial decisions; and (15) he lost some of

his stored records at his brother’s residence because of hurricane damage in 2004.16 
The cumulative or combined effect of one or more of those factors resulted in accounts 
becoming delinquent and Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns 
for the tax years 2003 through 2005, and 2008 through 2012.17 
During periods between ship assignments – called layoffs – Applicant did 
whatever he could to generate additional salary. He worked in the family business – a 
boarding home for mentally ill veterans – including yard work and maintenance, 
bookkeeping, conveying residents to medical appointments, and shopping; doing 
maintenance and serving as a waterfront person at a religious summer camp; stage 
manager, technical advisor, and actor, at a children’s theater company; operating a 
laundry; sales representation; cleaning stadiums; and numerous other part-time odd 
jobs.18 He was also active as an instructor, training various activities for the Red Cross; 
and he supported the Boy Scouts and his university.19 
Upon realizing the extent of his financial problems, in October 2009 – five years 
before the SOR was issued – Applicant engaged the professional services of a law firm 
to assist him in resolving his debt issues. For a monthly fee, the firm was authorized to 
negotiate on his behalf with six identified creditors in an effort to obtain settlements. The 
firm did not provide consumer credit counseling or debt consolidation.20 As a result of 
their efforts, debts totaling less than $20,000 were resolved.21 During the period June 
2013 through August 2014 – also well before the SOR was issued – Applicant hired 
another firm to repair his credit. They analyzed his credit report to identify mistakes and 
other disputable items, furnished him some financial guidance, and contacted the major 
credit bureaus and individual creditors in order to have the disputable items removed 
and the mistakes corrected.22 Applicant currently maintains a list of commitments, in lieu 
of a budget, so he can exercise control over his expenses. He gets little support from 
his wife, despite having granted her a power of attorney, because “she has an aversion 
to writing checks or making payments – even opening the mail.”23 
In addition to the unfiled federal income tax returns for several years, the 
amended SOR identified six delinquent debts that had been placed for collection,

was paid for by Applicant. See Tr. at 40.

charged off, or had gone to judgment, as reflected by an October 2011 credit report,24 a 
January 2014 credit report,25 and a March 2015 credit report.26 Those income tax 
issues, as well as the debts, totaling approximately $13,245, and their respective 
current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the 
Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described 
below. 
SOR ¶ 1.a.: Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax 
years 2003 through 2005, and 2008 through 2012. For each of those years, Applicant 
set up over-deductions to ensure the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was paid, and he 
filed extension requests.27 Because of his disorganization, frequent moves, and periods 
of sea duty, and other issues described above, he failed to file his income tax returns 
within the extended deadlines. Applicant sends his necessary income tax paperwork to 
his accountant in another state, and the returns are generally prepared by the 
accountant for Applicant’s eventual submission. The tax return for 2003 was finally filed 
in June 2006; the 2004 return was filed in June 2007; the 2005 return was filed in April 
2009; the 2008 through 2011 returns were subsequently filed, but no specific dates 
were identified; and the 2012 return was filed in February 2015. Applicant received 
refunds for each year, or would have received refunds if his returns had been timely 
filed.28 The federal income tax returns alleged in the SOR have been filed and the issue 
has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a home mortgage with a high credit of $73,103, outstanding 
balance of $75,574, and a past-due amount of $2,817, now increased to $9,260, that 
was placed for collection in 2013.29 Applicant purchased the residence when his brother 
got married and Applicant needed a place to reside. Shortly after he purchased the 
residence, he moved into his fiancé-now wife’s house. He was able to rent the 
residence, but the mortgage payments exceeded the rent payments he was receiving, 
and Applicant was unable to cover the full mortgage payments. He contacted the 
mortgage-lender to see if he could be eligible for a deed in lieu of foreclosure – a deed 
instrument in which the borrower conveys all interest in a real property to the lender to 
satisfy a loan that is in default and avoid foreclosure proceedings. Applicant followed the 
guidance he received from the lender and put the house on the market in June 2014, 
where it was supposed to be listed for at least 90 days. Subsequent discussions 
resulted in some confusion, and Applicant was told the house had to be listed for sale 
for a period of six months. Applicant’s realtor submitted the additional documentation, 
and the lender determined the listing date would be December 8, 2014. In January

2015, Applicant received an offer, but the lender took no action on it. The lender sent 
him some documents to sign, but since Applicant was at sea, he did not receive them. 
Applicant was approved for a pre-foreclosure sale program on June 1, 2015. On July 
31, 2015, the lender acknowledged receipt of Applicant’s request for a short sale, and 
indicated a decision would be made within 30 days from the date all required 
documentation is received. On August 21, 2015, Applicant and the proposed purchaser 
signed an FHA Purchase Agreement Addendum.30 As of the week before the hearing, 
the lender indicated it had all the necessary documentation, and it would issue a 
decision on the short sale within seven to ten days.31 As of September 17, 2015, all 
required inspections and repairs have been completed, and final approval was 
anticipated within ten business days.32 The account may still be unresolved, but it 
appears to be in the process of being resolved.  
SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.f.: This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of 
$5,000, high credit of $6,182, and a past-due balance of $7,504, that was placed for 
collection and charged off. In December 2013, a judgment was obtained in the amount 
of $6,182.33 Applicant’s attorney managed to settle the account with the creditor for an 
unspecified amount, thought to be approximately $3,600.34 The account has been 
resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d.: This is a medical account with a remaining balance of $54 that was 
placed for collection in 2013.35 Applicant contends the account was paid in full on an 
unspecified date.36 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a bank credit card account with an unpaid balance of $4,025 
that was placed for collection and charged off in 2011.37 Applicant was initially unable to 
negotiate a settlement, but after the account was charged off, his attorney purportedly 
managed to come to a settlement with the creditor for an amount less than $4,025.38 
The attorney’s status report indicates that the account had simply been “removed,” 
without identifying from what media it was removed: the program or the credit report.39

Applicant did not submit any documentation to support his contention that the account 
has been settled or otherwise resolved. The account is not listed in Applicant’s March 
2015 credit report.40 The account may still be unresolved simply because it was listed in 
a 2014 credit report, but it may also have been resolved because it does not appear in 
the recent credit report. It is unclear if the account has been resolved.  
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a medical account with a high credit and past-due balance of 
$105 that was placed for collection in 2011.41 The account was paid in full sometime 
before September 1, 2015.42 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is medical account with a high credit and past-due balance of 
$62 that was placed for collection in 2009.43 Applicant was not aware that the account 
had become delinquent because he never received any notices of delinquency.44 The 
account was paid in full sometime before August 28, 2015.45 The account has been 
resolved. 
During the hearing, Applicant estimated that he earned between $7,500 and 
$8,000 each month after taxes; had expenses of approximately $6,100; and realized a 
remainder of approximately $1,500 available for discretionary savings or spending.46 
Applicant subsequently submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting an average 
net monthly income of $7,000; total monthly expenses of $6,909 (including $720 for the 
non-residential mortgage which will end once the house is sold); leaving less than $100 
as a monthly remainder.47 Applicant has two 401(k) retirement plans worth a combined 
total of approximately $90,200.48 Applicant contends that when he is aboard ship he 
works very hard to be frugal and find the least expensive ways to do things.49 
While one utility account briefly became past-due in August 2015, it was promptly 
paid off that same month.50 All other non-SOR accounts have either been resolved with 
the assistance of Applicant’s attorney, are current, or are in a repayment program.51

Work Performance and Character References 
 The chief executive officer of a large international company, who is also a 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, has known Applicant for approximately 50 years. 
Applicant is one of his closest friends. He considers Applicant to be one of the most 
trustworthy individuals he has ever known, and supports Applicant’s eligibility for a high 
level security clearance.52 A coworker characterized Applicant as a sober individual who 
is a loyal and hardworking seaman.53 Applicant’s former scoutmaster noted that 
Applicant, an Eagle Scout, embodies the scout oath.54  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”55 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”56   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”57 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.58  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”59 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”60 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant failed 
to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2005, and 2008 through 
2012. Several accounts were placed for collection or charged off, and one went to 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”61  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies.  Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. To his credit, he acknowledged having made some 
                                                          
61
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

unspecified bad financial decisions and admitted being disorganized since 2002. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties make it difficult to 
conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Instead, as noted above, 
Applicant’s financial problems consisted of two components: failing to timely file his 
federal income tax returns over a span of years, and permitting some accounts to 
become delinquent. His finances were stretched due to his son’s conditions, and his 
second wife’s condition; problems with his first wife, supporting his second wife’s 
stepson and half-brother, and his second wife’s aversion to writing checks or opening 
the mail, especially when Applicant was at sea for lengthy periods. Added to those 
issues were his being forced to store his papers and records; spending various periods 
at sea, and upon his return, finding his papers in piles awaiting his attention; his 
unemployment between ship assignments; the loss of his license during the Fall of 
2008; his second wife becoming disabled and out of work since October 2012, with the 
resulting drop in her income; and the loss of some of his stored records because of 
hurricane damage in 2004. The cumulative or combined effect of one or more of those 
factors resulted in accounts periodically becoming delinquent and Applicant’s failure to 
timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005, and 2008 
through 2012. Many of those circumstances were substantially beyond his control, while 
some were within his control. Being disorganized may be an explanation, but it is not a 
valid excuse. 
In October 2009 – five years before the SOR was issued – Applicant engaged 
the professional services of a law firm to assist him in resolving his debt issues. As a 
result of their efforts, some debts were resolved. During the period June 2013 through 
August 2014 – also well before the SOR was issued – Applicant hired another firm to 
repair his credit. They analyzed his credit report, furnished him some financial guidance, 
and contacted the major credit bureaus and individual creditors in order to have the 
disputable items removed and the mistakes corrected. Applicant currently maintains a 
list of commitments, in lieu of a budget, so he can exercise control over his expenses. 
With the assistance and guidance furnished him, Applicant has resolved, or is in the 
process of resolving, all of the accounts alleged in the SOR as well as accounts that 
were not in the SOR. As it pertains to the delinquent accounts, there are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions, under the 
circumstances, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.62 
As it pertains to the untimely filing of his federal income tax returns, other 
concerns arise. Applicant’s disorganization, lengthy absences while at sea, and the loss 
of records due to a hurricane, over a short period might be understandable. However, in 
this instance, Applicant essentially routinely delayed filing his income tax returns for 
several years each tax year. Although he had an accountant prepare his returns, he 
failed to furnish the accountant with the necessary documentation for lengthy periods, 
and when the prepared returns were sent to him for signature, inaction ensued because 
Applicant was frequently at sea. Applicant contends that he learned his lesson and now 
is more organized by storing his documentation by year, rather than simply piled in a

disorganized mess. Nevertheless, his embrace of organization was not complete as of 
the hearing, for delays seemed to be continuing. To his credit, for each of the tax years 
alleged, Applicant set up over-deductions to ensure the IRS was paid, and he filed 
extension requests. Unfortunately, he failed to meet the extended filing deadlines. The 
federal income tax returns alleged in the SOR have been filed, and it appears that the 
issue has finally been resolved. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.63       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant does 
not appear to be financially astute, and he failed to fully appreciate the requirement to 
timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005, and 2008 
through 2012. Also, various accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, 
charged off, or went to judgment.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. An 
Eagle Scout, former naval officer, and an American Merchant Mariner, Applicant has an 
outstanding reputation in the workplace and in the community. His failures to timely file 
his federal income tax returns, despite receiving extensions, were in large measure 
caused by situations over which he had little control. It is also true that the length of 
such delays was exacerbated by his own disorganization. Nevertheless, Applicant 
eventually took more assertive actions and finally filed those tardy returns. Applicant 
recognized that he needed assistance in resolving his other financial issues, and in 
October 2009, he obtained the professional services of the first of two companies to

repair his credit and resolve his delinquencies. The majority of the delinquencies were 
resolved before the SOR was issued, but a few remained. Now, every delinquent 
account, both SOR and non-SOR, has either been resolved, or is in the process of 
being resolved. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. His actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 64 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was issued. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue the timely filing of 
annual federal income tax returns, not merely the filing of extensions for same, or the 
actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect his future eligibility for a 
security clearance.65 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
                                                          
64
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
65
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions to an 
applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR 
Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2005); ISCR 
Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.

 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
