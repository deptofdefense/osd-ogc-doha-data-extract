LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 27, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 14, 2015, and elected to have the case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He submitted another response on 
May 8, 2015, in which he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case 
was assigned to me on May 5, 2016. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 20, 2016, scheduling the hearing for June 
 
2 
 
21, 2016. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 15 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and 
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. 
The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted 
documents that were marked AE E through I and admitted without objection. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 5, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 52-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He served 
on active duty in the U.S. military from 1981 until he retired with an honorable discharge 
in 2003. He has worked for his current employer since he was on terminal leave from 
the military in 2002. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since his 
time in the military. He has a bachelor’s degree. He is divorced with a minor child.1 
 
Applicant’s and his ex-wife separated in 2008, which was the start of an 
extremely contentious and costly divorce and custody case. Their divorce decree was 
entered in March 2016 and their final property division order was entered in July 2016. 
Applicant was awarded custody of their minor child. He did not pay his bills and his 
taxes during the separation and divorce.2 
 
Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in September 2010. The case was 
dismissed in December 2010.3 
 
Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in July 2012. Under 
Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed mortgage loans of 
$918,222 and $145,000, and auto loans of $11,484 and $4,526. Under Schedule E, 
Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $2,556 owed to 
Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney and $57,065 owed to the IRS for tax years 2008 
through 2010. The petition listed debts totaling $65,509 under Schedule F, Creditors 
Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims.4  
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy plan was approved in November 2012. The court 
approved $74,429 in claims from the IRS. Applicant paid a total of $46,578 into the plan 
over 21 months until the case was dismissed in April 2014. Applicant stated that he had 
to dismiss the bankruptcy in order to move forward with his divorce and custody battle. 
During the plan, $5,903 was disbursed to the trustee and Applicant’s attorney, and 
$40,674 was disbursed to the IRS. None of the other creditors received anything.5

While the bankruptcy court was addressing Applicant’s taxes for tax years 2008 
through 2010, Applicant did not pay his taxes for tax years 2011 through 2012, a pattern 
he has continued through the present. In July 2014, he signed an installment payment 
agreement with the IRS in which he agreed to pay $584 per month on a total owed of 
$44,362 for tax years 2010 to 2012. He indicated in his April 2015 response to the SOR: 
“My tax situation has been resolved with the IRS and I am currently on a payment plan 
and will no longer have tax issues.”6   
 
The evidence shows otherwise. Applicant failed to provide proof of how much he 
paid through the installment agreement before it was terminated. He stated that he is 
now in an installment agreement for tax years 2010 through 2014. His weekly pay 
statement for August 12, 2016, shows a court-ordered payment of $338, with $2,369 
paid year-to-date via the court order. The final property settlement order from July 2016 
reported that Applicant was ordered to pay his “federal income tax debts for the tax 
years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014” in the amount of $85,730. He testified 
that he owed about $84,000, which includes about $4,400 owed for tax year 2015. In his 
post-hearing e-mail, he wrote that his tax debt is down to $45,000. He did not provide 
anything from the IRS to corroborate that figure.7 
 
The final property settlement order from July 2016 reported that in addition to his 
delinquent taxes, Applicant was ordered to pay 32 unsecured debts totaling $112,569. 
He received a 2012 car, and he is responsible to pay the loan on the car. His ex-wife 
received the real estate and three vehicles, and she is responsible to pay the mortgage 
and car loans on the properties and vehicles. She was also ordered to pay 50 
unsecured debts totaling $543,585.8    
 
The SOR alleges the two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b), 
two past-due mortgage accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, which are duplicate accounts), 
$59,000 owed to the IRS (SOR ¶ 1.gg), and 28 miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling 
about $108,000. Applicant denied owing the duplicate mortgage accounts because his 
ex-wife lived in the property after their separation and she is responsible for the 
mortgage payments. He admitted owing the remaining debts with the exception of the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($1,934), 1.j ($1,220), 1.m ($213), 1.n ($211), 1.o 
($11,561), 1.w ($702), 1.bb ($5,589), 1.cc ($65), 1.dd ($11,886), 1.ee ($15,716), and 
1.ff ($664), which he denied owing.9 
 
Credit reports list that Applicant is only an authorized user of the account alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.o ($11,561). The reports further list the high credit on the charged-off 
account as $11,561, but the balance is reported as $0. I have doubts about the veracity 
or security significance of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($1,220), 1.n ($211), and 1.w

($702). However, the remaining debts are established through a combination of credit 
reports, Applicant’s admissions, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and the final 
property settlement order.10 
 
 Applicant received financial counseling as a requirement of his bankruptcy. His 
annual salary is about $102,000, plus he receives a military retirement. He contributes 
10% of his income to his 401(k) retirement account, which has a balance of about 
$79,000. Except for his payments to the IRS, he has not paid any of the debts alleged in 
the SOR, including $65 owed to a pizza restaurant for a returned check (SOR ¶ 1.cc) 
and $664 owed to a government entity for what Applicant described as a ticket for 
fishing without a license (SOR ¶ 1.ff).11  
 
 Applicant stated that now that the divorce is final, he plans on paying his debts. 
He bought a used 2012 model car in April 2014, financed through a $37,403 loan with 
payments of $667 for 73 months. He stated that the price of the car was about $30,000, 
which was about $4,000 less than a new model, and the remainder of the loan was 
used to pay off the loan on the vehicle he traded. He stated that his old car was starting 
to cost more than it was worth and that the 2012 car was the only car on which he was 
able to obtain financing.12 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”

Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant had delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay. The 
evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are duplicate mortgage loans. When the same conduct is 
alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicate allegations 
 
6 
 
should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). SOR ¶ 1.d is concluded for Applicant. 
 
 Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases in 2010 and 2012. That does not 
generate security concerns independent of the delinquent debts that are already alleged 
in the SOR. SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are concluded for Applicant. 
 
 Applicant is only an authorized user of the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.o. I have 
doubts about the veracity or security significance of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.n, 
and 1.w. Those allegations are concluded for Applicant. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s contentious divorce and custody case were beyond his control. He 
denied owing the duplicate mortgage accounts because his ex-wife lived in the property 
after their separation and she is responsible for the mortgage payments. SOR ¶ 1.c is 
mitigated. 
 
 Applicant paid $40,674 to the IRS through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan and 
an unknown amount through installment agreements and court-ordered payments. 
However, he continued his pattern of not paying his current taxes when due. His total 
debt to the IRS is not going down because of his payments, it is increasing because he 
does not pay the taxes due for the current year. I believe that his testimony and the final 
property settlement order showing that he owes the IRS about $84,000 are more 
 
7 
 
accurate than his uncorroborated post-hearing statement that his tax debt is down to 
$45,000. The Appeal Board has stated that “[f]ailure to comply with Federal and/or state 
tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established 
Government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is 
essential for protecting classified information.” See e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-06686 at 2 
(App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2016). 
 
 Except for his payments to the IRS, Applicant has not paid any of the debts 
alleged in the SOR, including $65 owed to a pizza restaurant for a returned check and 
$664 owed for fishing without a license. He stated that now that the divorce is final, he 
plans on paying his debts. The Appeal Board has further held that “intentions to pay off 
debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other 
responsible approaches.” See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013) 
(quoting ISCR Case No. 08-08440 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009)).  
 
I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or 
that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and 
ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) are not applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially 
applicable. The first section of AG ¶ 20(c) (financial counseling) is applicable; the 
second section (clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) 
is not applicable. I find that financial considerations concerns remain despite the 
presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
8 
 
I considered Applicant’s honorable military service and his steady employment 
with a defense contractor. I also considered the contentious and costly nature of his 
divorce and custody case. However, he is in worse financial shape than when he filed a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2012 and when he entered into an installment 
agreement with the IRS in 2014. His tax issues will never be resolved unless he 
changes his pattern of not paying his taxes when due. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.i:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.k-1.m:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n-1.o:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.p-1.v:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.w:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.x-1.gg:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
